But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low. However, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. \u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris. While this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI \u2014 and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as \u201cthe world\u2019s greenest and leading independent AI lab.\u201d Mistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to \u201cput frontier AI in the hands of everyone.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company\u2019s advocacy for openness in AI. Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also available on iOS and Android. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France\u2019s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store. This comes in addition to Mistral AI\u2019s suite of models, which includes: Mistral AI\u2019s three founders\u00a0share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google\u2019s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers. Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C\u00e9dric O, which caused controversy due to his previous role. Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license. Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open-sourced in July 2024. While many of Mistral AI\u2019s offerings are free or now have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat\u2019s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat\u2019s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month. On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Overall, however, Mistral AI\u2019s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources. In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform and a \u20ac15 million investment. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU. In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP\u2019s entire text archive dating back to 1983. Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France\u2019s army and job agency, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around \u20ac1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession. In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest ever \u2014 valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million. Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Sofina, and Xavier Niel. Only six months later, it closed a Series A of \u20ac385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce. The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation. In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised \u20ac600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others. Mistral is \u201cnot for sale,\u201d Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cOf course, [an IPO is] the plan.\u201d This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer. However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here. Hype can be good or bad. This week, we\u2019ve seen startups on both sides of that fence \u2014 and being on the good side warranted large funding rounds. As the week comes to a close, it is time to tally the merits and demerits. Sparkle points: A peer-reviewed journal highlighted plans from German startup Proxima Fusion, lending new credibility to its concept and design for a working fusion power plant that can operate reliably and continuously. Oops points: Y Combinator deleted its posts about the demo from YC W25 company Optifye.ai after it went viral, and not in a good way. The startup claims to be building \u201cAl performance monitoring for factory workers,\u201d but others called it \u201csweatshops-as-a-service.\u201d Breakthrough points: Palo Alto-based startup Inception claims to have developed a diffusion-based large language model (DLM). Diffusion models that already exist are mainly used to create images, video, and audio, while Inception hopes to compete with LLMs. This week, several startups secured funding rounds that were notably large for their respective stages, and there are new funds ready to be deployed at the growth stage. Record round: Israeli startup Quantum Machines secured one of the biggest funding rounds a quantum computing company raised to date with its $170 million Series C led by PSG Equity with participation from Intel Capital, Red Dot Capital Partners, and existing investors. Full circle: Shop Circle, which makes an app suite for e-commerce, raised a $60 million Series B round that also financed the acquisition of Aiden, an AI-powered \u201cguided-selling\u201d software maker. Magic arms: Polish startup Nomagic, which makes robotic arms for logistics operations, raised a $44 million Series B led by the VC arm of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). It plans to use some of the funding to reach customers in North America. Magic touch: Taktile, a New York-based startup that helps fintechs build automated decision-making workflows, closed a $54 million Series B led by Balderton Capital with participation from Index Ventures, Tiger Global, YC, Prosus Ventures, and Visionaries Club. Idea relay: Relay raised a $35 million Series A round led by London-based VC Plural to bring the \u201casset-free\u201d last-mile parcel delivery model from Asia to Europe, in an approach that also reduces energy consumption and relies on e-bikes. Loved: Lovable, a fast-growing app-building AI platform coming out of Sweden, secured $15 million in a pre-Series A round led by Creandum. It also said it reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue after scaling to 30,000 paying customers with only $2 million spent. European growth: Private equity firm Thoma Bravo closed an inaugural $1.9 billion European fund to deepen its presence in the region and take fresh equity stakes in midsized software companies across the continent. Cambridge growth: Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC), a British fund that invests exclusively in the ecosystem around the University of Cambridge, launched a $126 million opportunity fund. This week marked the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. This spurred a wave of Ukrainian dual-use and defense tech startups innovating on and off the battlefield, and TechCrunch rounded up several of them here. Last week\u2019s newsletter included an error; Augury first achieved unicorn status in 2021.

It can be hard for enterprises to figure out which AI applications help their business and which are just hype. Workhelix wants to solve that problem. Workhelix is a tech-enabled service startup that works with enterprises to better understand and monitor AI automation at their companies. Workhelix breaks down a company\u2019s employee positions into specific job functions and tasks and scores each task for its suitability for AI adoption. This helps companies build roadmaps for how and where to adopt AI and gives enterprises a way to monitor if the AI they adopted is working. Co-founder and CEO James Milin told TechCrunch that many companies are getting AI adoption wrong because they are looking to apply AI to whole divisions of their business, which is too broad to find value. \u201cThat\u2019s not a systematic, rigorous way to adopt generative AI and is part of the reason people are frequently so disappointed,\u201d Milin said. \u201cBut if you look at all the jobs in an organization and break them down into bundles of tasks, and then score each task for its suitability to be accelerated by generative AI, now you can come up with a really quantitative rigorous way to adopt it.\u201d Workhelix\u2019s methodology of breaking down roles into tasks is based on years of research into the relationship between technology and productivity by Erik Brynjolfsson (pictured above), the director of Stanford\u2019s Digital Economy Lab and one of Workhelix\u2019s co-founders. \u201cIn the case of a lot of our work, there\u2019s this long tale of tasks that the machines actually don\u2019t help that much with,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cYou need humans to be involved. And then there\u2019s other tasks where the machines are very helpful. And almost every project that we look at, there\u2019s some of each of those.\u201d Brynjolfsson told TechCrunch that he\u2019s been researching this divide between technology and productivity for well over a decade. Prior to Workhelix, Brynjolfsson was sharing this research and methodology through published papers or through speaker gigs in board rooms, but he realized that if they added a software element, they could reach more companies. Brynjolfsson, also the co-chairman of Workhelix, paired up with Andrew McAfee, the co-director of the MIT initiative on the digital economy, and one of Brynjolfsson\u2019s co-authors; Daniel Rock, a Wharton professor; and Milin to launch Workhelix in 2022. The company launched its product in April 2024 and has seen strong demand from enterprise customers, including Accenture, Wayfair, and Coursera, among others. Workhelix\u2019s first dozen enterprise customers came through the door with zero paid advertising, Milin said. \u201cThis is something that they\u2019re really hungry for,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. There are consultants out there, but they don\u2019t have these kinds of tools. We\u2019re filling a huge gap. I think the biggest gap there is in the market.\u201d The company recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by AIX Ventures with participation from Andrew Ng\u2019s AI Fund, Accenture Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta, among other VCs. It also received funding from a number of angel investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, OpenAI co-founder Mira Murati, and Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, among others. Shaun Johnson, a founding partner at AIX Ventures, told TechCrunch that he was introduced to the company through Brynjolfsson\u2019s work at Stanford;\u00a0one of AIX Ventures\u2019 investing partners, Christopher Manning, is the director of Stanford\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory. Johnson said he understood the pain point Workhelix was trying to solve right away. \u201cErik, Andy, and Daniel have amazing access to the Fortune 500 C-suite and access to customers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme founder-market fit and their approach is extreme founder-product fit. That caused us to want to dive in.\u201d Workhelix plans to put its recently raised capital toward expanding the number of tasks and KPIs its software tracks. It will also keep building up the internal tools for the data scientists that directly help enterprise customers alongside Workhelix\u2019s product. In today\u2019s market that\u2019s obsessed with moving fast and automation, it\u2019s interesting that Workhelix\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just software but also includes a human element, too. The company stands by this approach, although this does make it harder for it to scale. That\u2019s because  the company wouldn\u2019t be as effective if it were just another software platform, Milin said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a trillion-dollar opportunity here to create value,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cNot that we\u2019re going to capture all, or even most of that, but we want to unlock that. As James said earlier, this is the biggest technological revolution that\u2019s ever happened and very few people are thinking about unlocking the business side of it.\u201d Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Sergey Brin says RTO is key to Google winning the AGI race Startup co-founded by longevity guru Peter Attia emerges from stealth Bluesky-based Instagram alternative Flashes launches publicly Microsoft hangs up on Skype: Service to shut down May 5, 2025 Meta fires around 20 employees for leaking confidential information OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company is \u2018out of GPUs\u2019 OpenAI unveils GPT-4.5 \u2018Orion,\u2019 its largest AI model yet Subscribe for the industry\u2019s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

Tax Share The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) fears businesses are falsely claiming tax breaks created for SMEs, warning workplaces of all sizes to double-check their deduction claims. The problems might stem from big businesses pushing the boundaries, one accountant claims, but small businesses are still coming under the ATO\u2019s microscope. The tax office last week announced business taxpayers are misjudging deduction claims under the Technology Investment Boost and the Skills and Training Boost packages. Those temporary \u2018boosts\u2019 provided an extra 20% \u2018bonus\u2019 tax deduction on eligible technology upgrades, and training for staff, respectively. Neither policy was instantly successful, as delays in enacting the tax breaks in Parliament caused uncertainty among small businesses. But official figures suggest business taxpayers eventually claimed far more than the government bargained for. Originally budgeted at a combined $1.55 billion, recent Treasury estimates state the policies will cost $1.85 billion in forgone tax revenue. Now, the tax office wants those businesses to make sure their claims are eligible. \u201cWe are seeing some small businesses incorrectly claim the boost measures due to errors or misunderstanding of the law,\u201d said the tax office. The ATO is advising entities that may have made a mistake to amend their tax return. \u201cIf you incorrectly claim, we may get in contact with you or your tax professional,\u201d it added. \u201cIf no action is taken, we may conduct a review and audit of your business.\u201d Businesses with an annual aggregated turnover below $50 million can claim \u2018bonus\u2019 deductions on eligible technology expenses incurred between the evening of March 29, 2022, and 30 June 2023. The training boost covers eligible expenses from the evening of March 29, 2022, to June 3,0 2024. Businesses can claim expenses up to $100,000, resulting in a maximum deduction of $20,000. The ATO is aware of businesses with turnover in excess of $50 million claiming both the Technology Investment Boost and the Skills and Training Boost deductions. Lisa Greig, principal at Perigee Advisers and experienced tax consultant, warned against \u201cthe big end of town\u201d claiming the deductions when they are not eligible. Businesses of that size \u201cshould have very, very competent tax advisors,\u201d Greig told SmartCompany on Friday. \u201cSo I would say that the big end of town needs to know the rules.\u201d Many small businesses are still not aware of the bonus deductions in the first place, continued Greig. \u201cThe client base that I look after, and the client base the other practitioners that I advise look after, we\u2019re the ones saying, \u2018Hey, claim this,\u2019 not the other way around,\u201d she said. Where those SMEs and sole traders are aware of the tax breaks, their deductions are relatively minor and fall well under the $100,000 expense cap, Greig continued. And in some cases, the cost of recruiting an accountant to apply for those deductions may exceed the benefit of the deduction itself, discouraging SMEs and sole traders from claiming them at all. \u201cSmall businesses take a very pragmatic approach to that sort of thing,\u201d Greig said. Nevertheless, big businesses making ineligible claims are not the only problem. For the Technology Investment Boost, the ATO is aware of claims that: For the Skills and Training Boost, the ATO has noticed claims that: Businesses and sole traders can check the technology and training boost eligibility requirements on the ATO website.

Startups Share Two Aussie startups revealed new funding rounds this week and they have two things in common: they were both founded in Queensland, and they are both powered by AI. Keep reading to learn more about Springboards and Tendl. Noosa-founded startup Springboards leads this week\u2019s startup funding round-up with $5 million in seed funding from leading VC fund Blackbird Ventures. Founded by advertising industry veterans Amy Tucker and Pip Bingemann, Springboards bills itself as an \u201cAI-powered platform built to accelerate creativity in advertising\u201d. The Springboards platform offers agencies nine AI-powered tools that have been designed to bolster creativity at every point in the advertising process. This includes helping teams uncover insights, generate ideas, validate concepts and design campaigns. According to the company \u2014 which has participated in a Google for Startups Accelerator program for Australian AI startups and has been named a pitch finalist for SXSW in Austin, Texas next month \u2014 its tech can generate between 10 to 30 times more creative diversity than leading AI platforms OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini combined. The startup officially launched this week but its platform is already being used by more than 120 advertising agencies globally. According to reports, the company has a pre-money valuation of more than $20 million. \u201cCreativity in advertising is under siege,\u201d said Tucker in a statement provided to SmartCompany. \u201cShrinking margins, skyrocketing pitching costs, and ever-higher client expectations are threatening the craft. We built\u00a0Springboards\u00a0to help creatives do what they do best: think big, explore boldly, and stay original.\u201d Queensland AI-powered tendering platform Tendl also revealed it has secured new funding this week, after completing a $2 million pre-seed funding round led by local VC firm Tidal Ventures. Startmate, 77 Partners, Brisbane Angels and Aussie Angels also participated in the round for the startup, which was founded in 2024 by CEO Laurie Nicol. Tendl, which is based in Toowoomba, is an AI-based platform that is designed to make it easier, and faster, for businesses to write, submit and complete government tenders through automated workflows. Nicol told SmartCompany earlier this week that he plans to use the new funding to expand Tendl\u2019s development team, while also expanding Tendl\u2019s operations both in Australia and overseas. \u201cUp until now, I\u2019ve been solo. Before this investment, I did everything in the business. I wrote the software, I spoke to customers and I did all the marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s that opportunity to really grow the team and hire some more domain-specific experts, people who can help to run the engineering team, build the tool, and allow me to go and pursue the sales side of things.

        "text": "Get unlimited access. Save 70% when you subscribe today. Log in Search Search If you like this article, share it with your friends. Retail Share The co-founder of Sydney-based wellness social enterprise I Am Grounded (IAG) has put one of Australia\u2019s Big 4 banks on blast in a LinkedIn post, after the bank asked the business for hundreds of free samples in return for \u2018exposure\u2019 and \u2018engagement\u2019. Vanessa Murillo founded the IAG enterprise with Lachlan Powell in 2018, focusing on energy snacks made from upcycled coffee fruit. She says the major Australian bank, through its health and wellness partner, recently invited the business to supply hundreds of IAG\u2019s SUPR bars for a series of upcoming wellness expos at multiple office locations. The founders, who have chosen to not publicly name the bank, were initially excited about the opportunity as it sounded like a great way to connect with a wellness-focused audience and align with a health-focused initiative. However, when they inquired about logistics and budget, the bank made it clear there was no budget available. Instead, the bank was hoping to receive hundreds of free samples in exchange for \u201cproduct exposure\u201d at the expos. Murillo told SmartCompany her first reactions were frustration and disappointment. \u201cAs a small business we don\u2019t have an unlimited budget to gift free product,\u201d she says. \u201cWe regularly invest in strategic sampling to get our products in front of the right audience, but when a large corporation with significant resources requests a substantial quantity of free products without offering any real value in return, it raises questions about how much they actually support small brands. \u201cEngagement and exposure are great in theory, but they don\u2019t pay for ingredients, packaging, shipping, or wages. \u201cIt felt like they wanted to leverage our brand\u2019s credibility and high-quality product without contributing anything in return.\u201d At RRP price, including shipping, fulfilling the bank\u2019s request for the SUPR bars would have cost around $2,000 to $2,500. While this might seem like a small amount for a major corporation, Murillo says it is a serious investment for a small, independent brand. So, she and Powell tried to negotiate a deal that would cover the cost price of the bars. \u201cWe responded professionally, thanking them for reaching out and asking for further details, including how many attendees were expected, what their budget was to contribute towards the samples, what the logistics would be for shipping and distribution, and whether they would be interested in covering at least the cost of goods,\u201d she says. \u201cThey responded by confirming that they were expecting around 500 attendees across multiple locations, that they were hoping for as many samples as possible, and that they had no budget at all to pay for the products. \u201cInstead, they proposed two options: either slicing the bars into small tasters or giving them away as prizes for activities at the expo.\u201d At that point, the founders \u201chad to make a call\u201d, she adds. \u201cWe love supporting wellness initiatives, but we also believe in valuing our product and the work that goes into creating it.\u201d For I Am Grounded, it\u2019s not the first time this has happened, with a well-known US-based fitness apparel brand last year requesting a few thousand free samples for one of its large-scale events. However, again, no budget was offered, only the promise of exposure. With International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) fast approaching, many women speakers are facing a similar situation, as requests come through for them to speak for free at events. Murillo believes this highlights a larger issue that many small brands face when working with big companies. \u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with gyms, yoga studios, and independent businesses that don\u2019t have massive budgets, and in those cases, we\u2019ve been happy to find ways to collaborate fairly,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when a large corporation requests significant quantities of free products without any commitment to supporting the business in return, it\u2019s frustrating. \u201cIf big corporations truly want to champion Australian brands, the least they can do is offer to cover costs. Otherwise, it feels like they\u2019re leveraging their size and influence without actually investing in the businesses they claim to support.\u201d Currently, I Am Grounded is stocked across Australia, including nationally in Woolworths, Harris Farm, several independent grocers, cafes, offices, hotels and gyms. Since launching, the social enterprise has upcycled over 33,000kg of coffee fruit into hundreds of thousands of energy bars and is actively exploring international expansion, starting with New Zealand, the MENA region, and the US. Murillo says after sharing this experience on LinkedIn, she was overwhelmed with private messages and responses from fellow brand owners who have encountered the same situation. \u201cMany reached out to share their frustration at how frequently large companies ask small brands for free products under the guise of \u2018exposure\u2019. Others commented on how these corporations do have the means to support small businesses yet often choose not to,\u201d she says. \u201cThe conversation has reinforced what I already believed: there needs to be real, tangible support for small businesses, not just empty promises of visibility. \u201cIf major corporations truly want to back small, values-driven brands, they need to go beyond exposure and offer genuine partnerships\u2014whether that means covering product costs, paying for activations, or providing meaningful business opportunities. \u201cThe small business ecosystem thrives when we all support each other fairly.\u201d Never miss a story: sign up to\u00a0SmartCompany\u2019s\u00a0free daily newsletter\u00a0and find our best stories on\u00a0LinkedIn.

        "text": "Get unlimited access. Save 70% when you subscribe today. Log in Search Search If you like this article, share it with your friends. Finance Retail Share An Australian deodorant and skincare care brand has publicly dropped Afterpay, claiming 6% transaction fees and lacklustre technical support made the buy now, pay later (BNPL) service untenable. But as merchant fees become a key issue for traders and regulators alike, Afterpay maintains its service provides businesses with more than just pay-in-four functionality. In an email sent to customers Thursday morning, Phoebe and Aaron Breckell, founders of Newcastle-based Woohoo Body, responded to customer concern over the recent decision. \u201cWe know lots of customers love the convenience and the spreading out of your expenses,\u201d said the email. \u201cWe totally get that. \u201cAnd we\u2019d still have Afterpay available if it weren\u2019t for the goings-on of the last few months.\u201d Woohoo Body\u2019s faced technical issues with its online Afterpay checkout late last year, and reached out to the fintech for support, according to the email. \u201cWe tried for months to get through to them, but they kept brushing us off,\u201d said the pair. And like other small Afterpay merchants, Woohoo Body faced a 6% transaction fee, plus 30c, for purchases made through its BNPL system. That far surpasses the cost of credit card acceptance, which the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) estimates costs merchants an average of 1.5% per transaction. Unlike the fees associated with other card payments, merchants are currently barred from surcharging customers for the cost of BNPL payments. The RBA last year said it would \u201crevisit\u201d the issue of BNPL surcharging in the future. For now, that \u201c6% is a lot for small businesses with so many other costs to absorb,\u201d said the Woohoo Body founders. \u201cAfterpay was costing us a small fortune \u2013 so much more than any other payment processor \u2014 and it actually felt really good to say \u2018OK, let\u2019s just turn it off!\u2019\u201d Speaking to SmartCompany on Thursday, Phoebe Breckell said many customers were accustomed to purchasing through Afterpay, which Woohoo Body has used since at least 2016. Despite concerns from avid Afterpay users, Breckell said other customers supported the decision. Beyond those who want to change their shopping habits, others were simply unaware of the costs borne by small businesses. \u201cThe other sentiment is people saying, \u2018Oh, wow, I didn\u2019t realise it cost you guys so much to use Afterpay,\u2019\u201d said Breckell. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll be choosing other other options in the future, because we support small businesses, and we don\u2019t want you to be incurring unnecessary costs.\u2019\u201d Afterpay, founded by Sydney neighbours Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar in 2014, has long said the services it provides merchants more than justify its fees. Shoppers face no extra costs when using Afterpay, if they pay each fortnightly instalment in full and on time, and the fintech says customers are drawn to merchants offering an alternative to traditional credit. Average basket sizes are also larger for merchants using Afterpay compared to other payment methods, according to the company, which was acquired by Square (now Block) in 2021 for $39 billion. In a statement provided to SmartCompany, an Afterpay spokesperson said, \u201cMerchant fees are attributed to the broader value merchants receive by partnering with Afterpay, which go well beyond that of typical payment systems\u201d. This includes \u201caccess to a new budget-focused customer base, reduced fraud risk, higher order values, dedicated marketing campaigns and a global Shop Directory that provides millions of referrals every month\u201d. When those factors are considered, Afterpay \u201cmore closely resembles marketing referral services such as Google and Facebook, and does so at a much lower cost,\u201d they added. The spokesperson said businesses struggling with digital checkouts can access Afterpay\u2019s merchant support team. Despite the recent Afterpay decision, Woohoo Body is keeping an open mind towards BNPL. It told customers it hopes to access instalment payments from both PayPal and Shopify\u2019s Shop Pay in the future. Afterpay, an early pioneer in the BNPL space, is keenly aware of the challenge posed by other fintech competitors and pay-in-four solutions offered directly by the banks. In a November blog post celebrating ten years of operation, Molnar said the fintech will continue evolving to meet customer needs. \u201cThere is more to be done, and more opportunity to evolve a system where money is accessible and equitable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with our customers, our merchants, and our partners, to take it to the next level.\u201d Never miss a story: sign up to\u00a0SmartCompany\u2019s\u00a0free daily newsletter\u00a0and find our best stories on\u00a0LinkedIn.

Tax Share It\u2019s no April Fool\u2019s joke: the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is changing how some struggling small businesses pay their GST. From April 1, 2025, the ATO will start moving some small business taxpayers from quarterly to monthly GST reporting, in an effort to boost compliance. Small businesses with a \u201chistory of not complying\u201d with their obligations will lose the ability to calculate, report, and pay their GST amounts on a quarterly basis, said the tax office last week. Businesses that missed payments, reported their BAS late, or incorrectly reported their GST amounts are among those likely to face monthly reporting requirements. The ATO will inform those businesses of their new monthly reporting requirements in writing. The vast majority of small businesses report GST quarterly, either in full reports or as part of the Simpler BAS method. Only 4% of small businesses elected to pay GST monthly, as of March 2023. Despite the extra legwork required to report monthly, the ATO says more frequent reporting of smaller amounts will result in increased tax compliance. \u201cMonthly reporting may make it easier for you to track your finances and business performance and make more informed decisions each month,\u201d according to the tax office. The news comes months after ATO Commissioner Rob Heferen said the tax office is \u201cexploring strategies to support taxpayers in getting their tax right from the start, providing more time for them to focus on their business\u201d. The end goal: \u201cmaking GST \u2018just happen\u2019\u201d, Heferen told the Tax Institute in October last year. The decision is the ATO\u2019s latest effort to whittle down the GST tax gap and increase system integrity. The ATO collected $85 billion in GST last financial year, according to the ATO\u2019s annual report, $3.6 billion more than the year prior. But the net GST gap \u2014 the difference between GST owed, and GST paid \u2014 has also risen since the COVID-19 lockdown years. Some $7.9 billion, or 9% of collectible GST, went unpaid in 2022-23, up from $4.4 billion (5.5%) in 2021-2022. Not all of the ATO\u2019s concerns are due to legitimate small businesses missing deadlines or accidentally misreporting their debts. The ATO is also clamping down on GST refunds after a disastrous fraud wave saw scammers create fake businesses to falsely claim billions of dollars in GST refunds. The tax office undertook 33,237 pre-issue refund checks for businesses that recently registered for GST in 2023-2024, according to the ATO\u2019s annual report.

Startups Share Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) women entrepreneurs in Queensland will get the opportunity to take their business or business idea to the next level through a new Queensland Government-funded pre-accelerator program. Anyone Can Build, which is funded by the Queensland Government as part of the Advance Queensland Accelerating Female Founders Program, will be delivered by The Creative Co-Operative in partnership with founders, investors, and entrepreneurship educator HEX. The 13-week pre-accelerator program, created specifically for CALD women in Queensland, aims to provide a safe and inclusive space to help women entrepreneurs develop their ideas, gain skills, connect with other founders and mentors, and access relevant tools and networks. Twelve spots are up for grabs for the program\u2019s first cohort, which starts in March. Participants who complete the program will receive $1,000 of matched funding from The Creative Co-Operative, to help them pay for business set-up costs, such as creating a website or setting up an ABN. There will be a total of four cohorts over the next two years. HEX CEO and co-founder Jeanette Cheah told SmartCompany the program is a great opportunity for early-stage and idea-stage founders who are women of colour based in Queensland to get the support that they need to build their startups. \u201cThe data speaks for itself about how there\u2019s a lack of capital flowing to great women founders,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the ways we can address that is to increase the pipeline of founders who are supported and have wonderful networks in place. \u201cIn a world where there\u2019s debate beginning around the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, investing in supporting diverse founders just makes great business sense.\u201d Cheah says the program is looking for women of colour from all walks of life. \u201cWe are looking for people who are thinking about a technology-powered business that could scale,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t apply if you don\u2019t know how to do technology, because that will be part of the program about how to include it in your business model. \u201cBut really, whatever problem you want to solve for society or for the people you know or from your lived experience, bring that problem to the pre-accelerator, and we will help you build a business around it.\u201d The Creative Co-Operative founder Priyanka Ashraf said one way to start closing the economic and social gap for CALD women is by building intergenerational wealth. \u201cEntrepreneurship, in the right conditions, allows women to navigate systemic barriers and create wealth in ways that traditional jobs may not,\u201d she said. The cut-off date for applications for Anyone Can Build is February 28 and more information about the program is available here.

        "text": "Get unlimited access. Save 70% when you subscribe today. Log in Search Search If you like this article, share it with your friends. Startups Artificial Intelligence Share Queensland AI-powered tendering platform Tendl has secured $2 million in pre-seed funding. According to the startup, the new funding will be used to expand Tendl\u2019s development team and accelerate the company\u2019s market growth globally. The funding round was led by Australian venture capital firm Tidal Ventures and followed by Startmate, 77 Partners, Brisbane Angels and Aussie Angels. Tendl, which was founded in 2024 by CEO Laurie Nicol and is based in Toowoomba, is an AI-based platform that is designed to streamline the tendering process for government suppliers and make it easier for businesses to write, submit and complete their tenders through automated workflows. Speaking with SmartCompany, Nicol confirmed the $2 million will be used to grow Tendl\u2019s development team, while also expanding Tendl\u2019s operations both in Australia and overseas. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got customers that are tendering in the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, so we\u2019re really using the investment to expand our presence in those markets and pick up a few more customers across the globe, but also growing out the development team,\u201d he says. \u201cUp until now, I\u2019ve been solo. Before this investment, I did everything in the business. I wrote the software, I spoke to customers and I did all the marketing. \u201cSo it\u2019s that opportunity to really grow the team and hire some more domain-specific experts, people who can help to run the engineering team, build the tool, and allow me to go and pursue the sales side of things. \u201cOur goal for the expansion is really to be global and to be looking at customers that are tendering.\u201d Tendl has already kickstarted the hiring process, with one engineer starting on Monday and another engineer lined up. According to the World Bank, the global government procurement market represents $10 trillion in annual spending. Public procurement accounts for 13% of gross domestic product in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, with $99 billion in Australian government procurement alone last year. Nicol says Tendl benefits businesses by reducing the amount of time they spend on tenders. \u201cWhen tendering, you\u2019re essentially spending hours of your staff\u2019s time. Sometimes your most senior, most expensive and most experienced staff are writing your tender response, and there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re going to win that tender. \u201cGenerally you might win one in three, one in five, one in 10, sometimes even less and so that means that you\u2019re spending a lot of time on an activity that you have no guarantee you\u2019re going to get a return.\u201d According to Nicol, Tendl will also help improve a firm\u2019s chances of success. \u201cYou\u2019re able to reuse your responses better, you\u2019re able to come up with better and new responses to tenders without having to spend hours of your most expensive resource filling out the answers,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s a really big time saver for businesses, and it\u2019s time saving on an activity where they had no guarantee of success. It\u2019s an at-risk cost that if they don\u2019t win, they don\u2019t sort of see payback. So they kind of have to share that across all of their opportunities. \u201cBut equally, they can\u2019t stop tendering, because tendering is kind of the lifeblood that, if you\u2019re a government contractor, all of your revenue comes through tendering, and if you stop doing it, you stop making revenue.\u201d Never miss a story: sign up to\u00a0SmartCompany\u2019s\u00a0free daily newsletter\u00a0and find our best stories on\u00a0LinkedIn.

        "text": "Get unlimited access. Save 70% when you subscribe today. Log in Search Search If you like this article, share it with your friends. Artificial Intelligence Startups Share Welcome back to Neural Notes, a weekly column where I look at how AI is affecting Australia. In this edition: Sydney-based startup EvenBetter.ai has secured a $500,000 investment from Shearwater Capital to help close gender pay gaps with data-driven insights. Founded by Sorrel Kesby and Ayal Steiner, EvenBetter.ai aims to move beyond compliance-focused reporting to provide organisations with actionable steps to address pay disparities. The platform identifies key drivers of pay gaps, such as leadership representation and market trends, offering recommendations to help businesses create more equitable workplaces.\u201cMany companies acknowledge gender pay gaps but struggle to take action,\u201d Kesby said on a call with SmartCompany. \u201cSo many different parts of a business use data \u2014 from P&Ls to recruitment tools. What doesn\u2019t yet exist\u2026 is the ability to do that with a platform where you can cut your data, analyse your data, and create those actionable insights.\u201dAccording to Kesby, EvenBetter.ai\u2019s models analyse employer-submitted pay and workforce data, breaking down the factors contributing to pay gaps. The platform generates insights and suggests practical actions, such as adjusting hiring strategies, reviewing promotion pathways, or assessing pay structures across different roles.Kesby says a key issue with traditional pay gap reporting is that by the time businesses submit data to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA), it\u2019s already outdated by about nine months.EvenBetter aims to address this by helping businesses move away from a \u2018set and forget\u2019 model by providing ongoing insights that reflect their current workforce, not just a snapshot from nearly a year ago.The funding from Shearwater Capital will support EvenBetter\u2019s next growth phase, including product development and expanding its customer base.Future iterations of the platform could include integrations with HR and accounting software, embedding pay equity insights into day-to-day business operations. EvenBetter.ai\u2019s launch and raise coincides with WGEA\u2019s new reporting mandates, which have increased the pressure on businesses to address pay gaps.Because of this, Kesby acknowledges not all companies will engage with the issue beyond compliance. The question is, does that matter if it\u2019s getting results?\u201cSome organisations will see it as a box ticking exercise\u2026 but ultimately anything we can do to improve upon the amount of people engaging properly and appropriately with this the better,\u201d Kesby said. Another under-discussed issue is how career breaks, particularly parental leave, affect long-term earnings and promotion opportunities. \u201cThere is a long way to go in organisations in Australia,\u201d Kesby said.She noted the true impact of leaves of absence in organisations isn\u2019t always fully captured in existing methodologies.\u201cI was speaking to some very senior HR leaders in a very large organisation recently and they commented on the challenges, even with the current methodology and the current reporting.\u201dKesby also sees an opportunity for deeper segmentation in pay equity analysis beyond gender \u2013 so long as employees are comfortable with that level of data being collected and it\u2019s done so ethically. If there\u2019s an organisation that has data to that level of granularity, then absolutely we can, we can cut that data. We\u2019re building it to be scalable,\u201d Kesby said.Ultimately, EvenBetter.ai says it aims to provide businesses with fewer excuses for inaction. \u201cIt\u2019s great business and I think it\u2019s great for what WGEA is promoting with the awareness of the gender pay gap in Australia,\u201d Kesby said.

The private equity firm is understood to be looking at a three-way split of Walgreens Boots Alliance with each having distinct capital structures, The Financial Times reported. The move would result in Walgreens, Boots and speciality pharma unit Shields Health Solutions becoming independent companies. People familiar with the matter told the title that financing for the prospective privatisation deal is not expected to be an issue despite weeks of on-off discussions with the New York-based firm. They added that talks could still fall apart in the coming weeks. Walgreens is thought to have been in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore since December, but a deal is yet to be reached. This is the third time the US owner has engaged in talks for a sale. It shelved plans for a multibillion-pound deal last June\u00a0as it cut its profit outlook and announced plans to close up to 700 US stores. The group had first attempted to sell Boots back in 2022 for an estimated \u00a37bn\u00a0but abandoned the plan, deciding that offers from firms including Apollo Global Management undervalued the retailer.

Learn More You.com launched a new artificial intelligence research tool today that promises to transform how businesses conduct market research by analyzing hundreds of sources simultaneously and producing comprehensive reports in minutes instead of weeks. The tool, called Advanced Research & Insights agent (ARI), targets the $250-billion management consulting industry by automating the labor-intensive research process that typically requires teams of analysts to pore over documents for days or weeks. \u201cThe entire world of knowledge work is changing, and that\u2019s a trillion-dollar-plus industry,\u201d said Richard Socher, cofounder and CEO of You.com, in an interview with VentureBeat. \u201cWhen every employee has instant access to comprehensive, validated insights that previously required teams of consultants and weeks of work, it changes the speed and quality of business decision-making.\u201d What sets ARI apart from existing AI research tools is its ability to process and analyze more than 400 sources simultaneously \u2014 roughly 10 times the number that competing systems can handle, according to the company. This capability comes from a novel approach to managing context and compressing information. \u201cThe way that we\u2019re able to find that many sources is [that] we\u2019re taking this iterative research approach,\u201d Bryan McCann, cofounder and CTO of You.com, told VentureBeat. \u201cWe bring back an initial set of sources, summarize and create a first research report, and then gather even more. At each step, we\u2019re compressing that information down so we\u2019re only adding new things.\u201d ARI doesn\u2019t just compile text-based reports. The system automatically generates interactive visualizations based on the data it discovers \u2014 a feature You.com claims is unique among current AI research tools. During a demonstration, Socher showed examples of automatically generated reports on renewable energy that included interactive plots showing a variety of information. \u201cIt puts together this beautiful PDF,\u201d Socher said. \u201cSince it talks about energy, it includes useful plots looking at market size, market growth expectations, mix of renewables and fossil fuels, solar energy growth rates.\u201d Crucially for enterprise customers, ARI provides direct source verification for every claim. Users can click on any citation and the system will highlight exactly where the information came from, making fact-checking substantially faster. \u201cWhen you click on the citation, it actually scrolls down and highlights exactly where it found that fact,\u201d Socher demonstrated. \u201cIf your career and your job depends on the facts being right, that\u2019s very helpful.\u201d You.com is positioning ARI primarily for enterprise customers in research-intensive industries. Early adopters include Germany\u2019s largest medical publisher, Wort & Bild Verlag, and global consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cWe already have several hundreds of active accounts from each major consulting company,\u201d Socher noted. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with them and help them be more productive.\u201d Dr. Dennis Ballwieser, managing director at Wort & Bild Verlag, reported that research time \u201chas dropped from a few days to just a few hours\u201d through using ARI, and praised the accuracy of its results across both German and English content. ARI enters an increasingly crowded marketplace for AI research tools. Recent weeks have seen announcements of DeepSeek, Claude 3.7 from Anthropic and various other research-oriented models. Socher claims ARI differentiates itself through comprehensiveness, verification capabilities and speed. \u201cCompared to research tools from OpenAI, for instance, ARI has 10 times the sources, but at the same time, it\u2019s three times faster,\u201d he said. This comparison is significant given the competitive landscape. OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research, powered by its o3 model, leads the market with roughly an 8% hallucination rate but typically processes only 15-30 sources per query. Google launched its own Deep Research feature in December, while Perplexity and X.AI\u2019s Grok 3 have also entered the race with similar offerings. Unlike some competing systems, ARI doesn\u2019t make decisions about which information is most trustworthy but instead presents comprehensive findings. \u201cARI is optimized for comprehensiveness, so if it comes across contradicting statements, it\u2019s much more likely to just tell you this source said this, and these sources said that,\u201d McCann explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not really inclined to make the decision for you as to which information is the most trustworthy.\u201d A key aspect of ARI\u2019s enterprise strategy is its ability to incorporate internal company data alongside public sources \u2014 creating a bridge between an organization\u2019s proprietary information and the broader research landscape. \u201cThe biggest thing that we\u2019re already doing now with enterprise customers is to give ARI access to their company internal data,\u201d Socher said. \u201cSo you get all these amazing dashboards and insights right away about your own organization.\u201d You.com is taking an unusual approach to pricing ARI, charging per report rather than based on computational resources consumed \u2014 a strategy that aligns costs with business value rather than technical implementation. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at pricing not by token anymore, but more on a usage basis, at the actual response level,\u201d McCann explained. \u201cThinking of it more like: The final piece of collateral that comes out is the thing that you\u2019re paying for \u2014 orders of magnitude cheaper than it would have cost in the past.\u201d This approach reflects You.com\u2019s belief that AI usage will follow Jevons paradox: as efficiency increases, total consumption rises rather than falls. \u201cOf course, the training costs will continue to decrease,\u201d said Socher. \u201cBut when everyone realizes that giving a model more computational resources at run-time produces better results, it no longer makes sense to think about intelligence as a fixed property of any single model.\u201d You.com sees ARI as just the first step in transforming how organizations approach knowledge work. The company plans to make ARI more agentic \u2014 capable of taking independent actions based on research findings. \u201cFor as long as we\u2019ve been building it, we\u2019ve wanted to make it more agentic,\u201d McCann said. \u201cIf you can access almost all of the information out there about a thing, that should provide a better foundation for any decision-making on top of that information.\u201d Socher frames You.com\u2019s evolution around what he calls \u201cthe four A\u2019s: accurate answers, agents and AGI.\u201d He envisions a future when everyone becomes a manager of AI systems. \u201cKids that grow up with Siri and Alexa in the house already learn to assign certain questions to those things,\u201d Socher observed. \u201cThat\u2019s the first baby steps of becoming managers for AI.\u201d And as those AIs get smarter, we\u2019re going to manage them more carefully while giving them increasingly complex tasks \u2014 with research reports being just the beginning of what promises to be a profound transformation in how knowledge work gets done.

        "title": "Virtual Cards Form Cornerstones of Commerce Ecosystems",
        "text": "The surge in virtual card issuance \u2014 and the linking of banks, FinTechs, enterprises and brands to get those cards out into the market for daily use\u00a0 \u2014 speaks volumes to how those cards are helping to form new commerce ecosystems for consumers and businesses. The purely digital flow, from card design to issuance to use, underpins new payment experiences. For the banks and the brands launching card products, the platform approach shortens the time to market to introduce, say, a BNPL card or a B2B-focused instrument that tailors spend management across a supply chain. The continued embrace of credentials and program management through which platforms manage compliance and risk remains a growth engine for the enablers, as cards and credentials are delivered in real time. The benefits are gaining wider recognition. In just one example, PYMNTS Intelligence found in December that, among middle-market companies \u2014 defined as firms with annual sales of between $50 million to $1 billion \u2014 56% of executives using virtual cards have cited the improvements in working capital management as among the key advantages of using those cards. Yet the market is virtually untapped, as the data shows that just 3.3% of North American Growth Corporates use virtual cards. During Marqeta\u2019s earnings call this week, the company said that it had struck a deal to acquire TransactPay, a BIN Sponsorship provider licensed as an E-Money Institution (EMI) in the U.K. and European Economic Area. The deal, Marqeta said in the announcement, will strengthen its card program management capabilities in the U.K. and Europe. As PYMNTS reported in tandem with earnings, EMIs are required in order to, among other things, issue prepaid and virtual cards in those regions. Concurrently, Marqeta announced that the American Express network, per Interim CEO Mike Milotich\u2019s observations on the call, would be \u201ca new option for credit and debit card programs\u201d in joint efforts that would begin later this year. With a nod to how the ecosystems are taking shape, Milotich said that his company had early on \u201ceased the burden of merchant adoption with instant issuance virtual cards. Then we were the first to help providers deliver the BNPL value proposition via card that they issue, making BNPL available anywhere a card is accepted,\u201d and now has been working with Visa and Mastercard to deliver their recently announced flexible card credentials, which lets users switch across spending sources with that credential. \u201cWe are also making progress on Marqeta Flex with the goal of enhancing how BNPL payment options can be delivered inside payment apps and wallets, servicing them when needed within the existing payment flow,\u201d he added. The shift toward the ecosystems can be seen in the firm\u2019s mix shift, where the CEO said that consumer use cases are growing \u201cmuch faster than single-use commercial virtual card.\u201d Milotich also noted that in the embedded finance space, \u201cwe are trying to offer the brand more control over the value proposition, the marketing, the onboarding and have it be delivered as a truly embedded experience.\u201d BILL.com noted in its own earnings report and conference call commentary \u2014 and with a focus on B2B \u2014 that its virtual card solution has added straight through processing provider. John Rettig, president and CFO, told analysts that within the spend and expense category, the company saw 13% card payment volume growth year over year. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.",

The new financing program,\u00a0ShipBob Capital, is powered by\u00a0JPMorgan-backed\u00a0Slope and can be accessed through a Finances tab in the ShipBob dashboard, ShipBob said in a Thursday (Feb. 27)\u00a0press release. ShipBob Capital offers ShipBob customers, who are small- to medium-sized business (SMB) and mid-market eCommerce merchants, access to a flexible line of credit that they can withdraw at any time, according to the release. The program offers eligible merchants approval for up to $250,000 instantly and up to millions of dollars in as little as two days; a choice of repayment plans with competitive APRs; and an application process that takes about five minutes, per the release. \u201cWith ShipBob Capital, our merchants can access the funding they need to invest in their business and scale, whether that means stocking up on more inventory or launching new products, without worrying about cash flow constraints,\u201d ShipBob CEO and Co-founder\u00a0Dhruv Saxena said in the release. Because ShipBob Capital, powered by Slope, is built into ShipBob\u2019s platform, Slope has real-time operational insights into borrowers\u2019 actual order volumes, inventory turnover and shipping data, which enable better underwriting and higher approvals, Slope Co-founder and Chief Product Officer\u00a0Alice Deng wrote in a Thursday\u00a0blog post. \u201cSlope\u2019s underwriting and product design make applying simple, approvals fast, and accessing capital frictionless,\u201d Deng wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s built directly into the ShipBob dashboard, so getting capital is as easy as managing fulfillment.\u201d When Slope raised $30 million in an equity round in September 2023 to scale its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered payments platform for B2B businesses, the company said its platform included consumer-grade checkout processes, customer and vendor risk assessment, payment reconciliation and cash management. Slope added that its AI tools power these functions to deliver order-to-cash workflow automation. ShipBob raised $200 million in a Series E funding round in June 2021, saying that it was working with a growing number of eCommerce businesses, expanding its app store integrations and adding to its network of\u00a0fulfillment centers.

        "title": "CFPB Employees Tell Court Leaders Plan to Wind Down Agency",
        "text": "Several federal employees reportedly said in statements submitted for a lawsuit that the new leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) plans to wind down the agency and fire most of its employees. The statements were made in a case brought by the CFPB\u2019s union and were released with the employees\u2019 names replaced by pseudonyms, CNBC reported Friday (Feb. 28). In the filings, employees said they had attended meetings between Feb. 18 and Tuesday (Feb. 25) in which leaders of the CFPB and members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) discussed mass layoffs that would be carried out in three phases and end two or three months later with only five statutorily mandated positions remaining, according to the report. The CFPB did not immediately reply to PYMNTS\u2019 request for comment. The case by the CFPB\u2019s union aims to stop the agency\u2019s firings that already impacted about 200 probationary and term employees, the report said. It led to the CFPB\u2019s actions being paused until a March 3 hearing, per the report. The union, the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), said in a Feb. 10 press release announcing the lawsuit that a shutdown of the CFPB would violate the separation of powers, as the agency was created by Congress. \u201cWhat is happening to CFPB should shock all Americans who are wondering what will happen to consumers without the CFPB on the job, and more broadly, what happens when the executive branch ignores the will of Congress,\u201d Doreen Greenwald, national president of the NTEU, said in the release. It was reported Tuesday (Feb. 25) that Justice Department attorneys said in court filings that the Trump administration plans to streamline, not dismantle, the CFPB. The Justice Department attorneys said that the lease of the CFPB\u2019s headquarters has been canceled and that the agency will require less office space moving forward, but that the agency will continue to operate its call center and database for consumer complaints, produce mortgage data and require payments to consumers harmed by corporate misconduct. The Trump administration\u2019s nominee to head the CFPB, Jonathan McKernan, said Thursday (Feb. 27), that as director he would be tasked with carrying out \u201cspecific statutory responsibilities that are mandatory.\u201d Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee during a hearing on his nomination, McKernan said: \u201cI am fully committed to following the law fully and faithfully.\u201d We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.",

        "title": "Citi Says FinTechs Need to Win on These 3 Things",
        "text": "The strongest businesses are forged in the crucible of change. That\u2019s true for FinTech and financial services, where executives are finding themselves striving to keep pace with technological advancements while also facing intensifying demands for transparency and solvency. The convergence of these challenges, navigating the dual pressures of innovation and regulatory scrutiny, is reshaping the very definition of what it means to be a FinTech or financial services company. \u201cThe competitive landscape has shifted pretty dramatically in the last couple of years,\u201d Will Artingstall, head of digital asset payments and eCommerce services at Citi Services, told PYMNTS during a discussion for the series \u201cWhat\u2019s Next In Payments: What Does It Mean to Be a FinTech in 2025?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just the old nature of FinTechs competing with FinTechs,\u201d Artingstall said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re often now starting to see is neobanks entering the space. You\u2019re seeing banks themselves offering more digital services.\u201d The crowded market is driving FinTechs to refine their value propositions, focusing on cost, speed and transparency, three pillars that Artingstall said are essential for differentiation. \u201cThe ability to drive differentiation and operate and drive a value proposition that attracts consumers is a unique thing for every single FinTech that\u2019s out there,\u201d he said. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative force in many industries, and FinTech is no exception. Artingstall described Citi\u2019s approach to integrating AI, saying it\u2019s not a \u201cside project\u201d but a core part of the company\u2019s strategy. AI\u2019s potential in the FinTech sector spans compliance, automation and enhanced customer experiences. By automating routine processes and improving compliance mechanisms, FinTechs can streamline operations and reduce costs. However, Artingstall cautioned against seeing AI as a silver bullet, comparing it to the earlier hype around robotic process automation. \u201cIf you have a bad process, RPA doesn\u2019t fix a bad process,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still need to have a good fundamental process. \u201cWe are making AI technology available to our colleagues in a thoughtful and measured way that allows us to assess the impacts and the benefits in real time of it,\u201d he added. For FinTechs, achieving scale remains a critical goal, particularly in a market with thousands of competitors. For Citi, collaborating with FinTech partners on solutions like Citi\u00ae Payments Express\u00a0\u2014 a scalable, cloud-enabled commerce solution \u2014 has been central to fostering growth and driving efficiency. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested across the board in cross-border payments, domestic payments, and much of our banking-as-a-service capabilities to help support that scale-based activity,\u201d Artingstall said, adding that the Citi Payments Express platform, operational in over 18 markets, reflects Citi\u2019s commitment to meeting the demands of digital commerce. While FinTechs have traditionally attracted millennials and Generation Z consumers, the appeal of app-based financial services is growing among older demographics as well, challenging companies to cater to a broader, more diverse audience while maintaining a competitive edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a big drive toward app-based transacting and app-based usage,\u201d Artingstall said. \u201cMost folks are going to tend to be multi-app driven \u2026 multi-platform usage is the way consumers view the world.\u201d \u201cMobile apps are also making it quite easy to select more than one provider, compare them in real time, then flip over into which one you would like,\u201d he added. As FinTechs innovate, they must also navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment. This balancing act is particularly crucial as major regulatory changes loom in both the United States and Europe. FinTechs should adopt a proactive approach to compliance by understanding regulatory priorities, particularly around financial crime and financial inclusion, Artingstall said. \u201cIn the past year, I think we\u2019ve seen a huge amount of increased scrutiny around fin crime from regulators,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been several regulatory actions that are targeting mitigating activities like KYC [know your customer] and AML [anti-money laundering] practices within financial companies.\u201d The upcoming transition from PSD2 to PSD3 and PSR1 in Europe is also a focus for FinTechs. These changes will likely introduce stricter standards and reduce exemptions, increasing the compliance burden on companies operating in the space. The challenge is not limited to Europe; in the U.S., the inconsistency between state and federal regulations adds another layer of complexity. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a push that we\u2019re seeing from multiple different bodies that are thinking about how to help support a more consistent approach when they\u2019re thinking about the regulation within the U.S.,\u201d Artingstall said. Looking ahead, partnerships between banks and FinTechs will likely play a role in the industry\u2019s evolution, Artingstall said. Citi itself has adopted a co-creation model, working closely with FinTechs and other partners to develop tailored solutions. The focus on co-creating products ensures that solutions are not only market-ready but also closely aligned with client needs. \u201cWe found significant success in that space,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we tend to find the deals are a little bit stickier, but they\u2019re also a little bit larger in size and scale really well.\u201d As FinTechs continue to adapt to a rapidly changing market, their success will hinge on the ability to deliver cost, speed and transparency while balancing innovation with compliance, scaling effectively and delivering differentiated value. \u201cOverall, in our minds, it\u2019s absolutely clear that those differentiators are the things to look for,\u201d Artingstall said. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.",

        "text": "When it comes to FinTechs, change and transformation are often the only constants. That makes the question of what it means to be a FinTech in 2025 more than a theoretical exercise \u2014 it\u2019s a critical consideration. And while FinTechs have historically been associated with younger, digitally savvy consumers, that trend is shifting. \u201cThe myth has been busted that older generations, whether we\u2019re talking about the U.S. market or globally, are afraid of digital financial services,\u201d David Durovy, the senior vice president of transformation at i2c, told PYMNTS during a discussion for the series \u201cWhat\u2019s Next In Payments: What Does It Mean To Be A FinTech in 2025?\u201d The convergence of legacy financial institutions and FinTechs is also redefining market dynamics. The overlap between big banks adopting FinTech capabilities and FinTechs facing the reality of compliance management and regulatory oversight is creating a hybrid model where the lines between traditional and digital-native financial services blur. \u201cThe traditional legacy players look much more like FinTechs than they did 10 years ago, five years ago, or even 12 months ago,\u201d Durovy said. This means they are embracing cloud-native capabilities and API interoperability. But, he added, legacy architectural constraints are often still not addressed, resulting in enhancements that might only be \u201cskin deep.\u201d The value proposition of FinTechs has undergone a transformation over the past year, both for consumers and businesses. According to Durovy, the industry\u2019s evolution is not about discovering a \u201csilver bullet\u201d but rather about adapting in a market where stakeholder expectations continue to change. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different ways to look at it, but coming at it from the perspective of the consumer lens and what really is different, I think we\u2019ve talked before about the world of risk and oversight and external threats,\u201d he said. Consumers today are more focused on their financial security than ever before. From cyberthreats to household financial risks, Durovy emphasized that FinTechs must rethink customer engagement and the customer journey itself, highlighting the need for innovative tools and capabilities that specifically address these heightened concerns. \u201cWe need to speak with our customers and our clients in different ways. We need to think about the customer journey potentially in a different way,\u201d he said. Growth remains a crucial goal for FinTechs, but scaling effectively requires a nuanced approach. This can mean something very different if you are a five-person FinTech startup or if you are leading a 50,000-person legacy payments platform company \u2014 understanding operational limits, required investments, and market potential is vital. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between \u2018I can stretch,\u2019 and \u2018I can make do,\u2019 versus \u2018I have reached a breaking point,\u2019\u201d Durovy said, stressing the need for businesses \u2014 especially high-growth FinTechs \u2014 to recognize their critical points of failure. This strategic foresight extends to technology adoption as well. Durovy advised against rushing into large-scale software solutions prematurely. \u201cThere is often a push very quick out of the gate that we [FinTechs] need to have these tools in place to reach any level of success. \u2026 I personally feel that that isn\u2019t always the case,\u201d he said, advocating for a more measured and \u201cGoldilocks\u201d approach to technology investments. A significant theme in the maturation of FinTech is the regulatory environment. \u201cRegulatory compliance has changed the entire game,\u201d Durovy said. He described the early days of FinTech as a \u201cwild, wild west\u201d where regulations were either nonexistent or loosely applied. Today, however, it is vastly different, with clear and often stringent rules guiding new products, services and use cases. The focus for FinTechs will be on setting robust risk management and aligning compliance with evolving regulations. Durovy pointed to the dangers of ignoring regulatory developments. \u201cWe have to be upfront and honest about what those gray spaces are because we can\u2019t just turn a blind eye as an industry and pretend as though they won\u2019t be regulated tomorrow,\u201d he said. Partnerships are also increasingly shaping the FinTech landscape. Durovy sees collaborations as a critical component of success. By leveraging partnerships, both large and small players can accelerate market entry, enhance brand awareness and fuel innovation. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing [legacy players] get into new markets because they\u2019re thinking about going to market differently, structuring for success in a different way,\u201d he said. Looking ahead, Durovy concluded with a look at how i2c itself approaches these industry trends. The company emphasizes flexibility and configurability in its solutions, allowing for a tailored approach to market needs. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being in a candy store, right? There\u2019s so much to pick from, what do you pick first?\u201d he said, adding that as the industry grows up and grows out, the companies that succeed will be those that define their vision clearly, scale judiciously and partner wisely. We\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.",

In a team, psychological safety\u2014feeling able to take interpersonal risks\u2014leads to high performance. When a team is psychologically safe, people raise the alarm if they spot a problem and share the risky idea that might drive innovation. They tell hard truths but are also more open to feedback for improvement. They feel seen, heard, and part of a bigger picture. All the research points to psychologically safe, people-driven business as being more successful. Psychological safety leads to greater productivity, engagement, retention, well-being, creativity, innovation, and happiness. Kindness and empathy aren\u2019t just moral nice-to-haves. They\u2019re strategic advantages for building a culture of psychological safety where the work matters because the people doing it matter. Kindness often gets bad press, or people might even say there\u2019s no place for kindness at work. Kindness is often considered weak or a quality of pushovers. But this is because people confuse being kind with being nice. ABOUT THE AUTHOR The best new nonfiction book summaries in 15 minutes, directly from the authors.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-28-2025SECOND SHIFT A new report by the nonprofit Moms First found that in states with mandatory paid-leave policies, the majority of eligible parents are still not using the benefit. [Photo: \nMathias Reding/Unsplash] BY\u00a0Pavithra Mohan4 minute readShare Even as paid family leave has stalled at the federal level, a growing number of states have taken up the issue in recent years. Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have now passed legislation that makes paid leave mandatory, while a handful of other states have also introduced voluntary systems that leave it to private insurance companies and employers to opt into the benefit. Despite those legislative wins, however, a new report by the nonprofit Moms First and McKinsey indicates that many eligible workers in states with mandatory paid leave are not taking advantage of their access to the benefit. The analysis focused on the paid-leave programs in New York, New Jersey, and California\u2014which were among the first states to offer the benefit\u2014and also surveyed over 2,000 parents in those states. The vast majority of working parents were eligible for paid leave, in spite of the variation in state-specific requirements for wages or time worked. But the report found that only 40% of eligible parents actually used their paid-leave benefits in 2022, which were worth an estimated $6,000 to $10,000 per person. The families that did take advantage of those policies reported being nearly twice as satisfied with paid leave than they were with other state benefits; at the same time, parents were less likely to take paid leave when compared to similar government offerings like unemployment benefits. Even as more states have adopted laws mandating paid leave, most workers across the country still lack access to it: As of 2024, only 31% of full-time employees in the U.S. had paid leave. There are a number of reasons why utilization of paid leave may be lower than expected, given how critical the benefit can be for families. First is a lack of awareness, which might explain why parents are more likely to use unemployment benefits; of the respondents who did not use paid leave, 60% said they did not know it was available. | Other parents were aware of the benefit but didn\u2019t feel comfortable using it, either due to concerns over job security or career progression. \u201cI would have taken [paid family leave] if I could afford it and wouldn\u2019t lose my job,\u201d one New York-based mother told Moms First. Low-wage workers were especially likely to worry about whether they could afford to take leave\u2014even in New York, where the paid leave law explicitly promises job protection. In some cases, there were concerns over wage replacement, since paid leave laws typically only cover part of an employee\u2019s salary (anywhere from 60% to 90%, depending on how much they earn). But the report also indicates that the very disparities that make paid leave so important play a role in why many parents are not fully utilizing the benefit. Since women are more likely to shoulder a greater share of childcare responsibilities, there are fewer women who are eligible for paid leave. In some cases, they may not meet the wage or time worked criteria mandated by state law. (Overall labor participation is also higher for men than it is for women.) In many cases, the cost of childcare can lead one parent to drop out of the workforce and stay home with their children\u2014a burden that disproportionately falls on women. On the other hand, while more men are eligible for paid leave benefits, they are less inclined to use them\u2014half as likely, in fact. (The unused parental leave captured by the report came to a total of six million weeks, with men accounting for four million.) A number of male respondents actually noted that they didn\u2019t think it was necessary to take leave if their partner was already doing so.\u00a0Race, too, seems to play a role in how widely paid leave is utilized: On the whole, Latino and Black parents are less likely to be eligible for the benefit than white and Asian parents. When they do have access to it, however, Black parents are the most likely to use paid leave. Another significant hurdle is the administrative burden of applying for paid leave. While many parents who used paid leave expressed satisfaction with the benefit after the fact, almost 60% who opted out said they were frustrated by the application process. Even when paid leave is provided by the state, the vast majority of parents relied on their employer to help guide them through a complicated process, which is likely easier to navigate at large companies that are better positioned to assist their workers. In the absence of a federal law\u2014which lost traction after the pandemic\u2014advocates for paid leave have pushed for legislation at the state level, leading many progressive states to adopt mandatory policies over the past decade. But the Moms First report makes clear that without increasing utilization of paid leave, countless parents are not reaping the benefits, from offsetting the steep cost of childcare to improving health outcomes for mothers and children.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-28-2025HOW TO BE A SUCCESS AT EVERYTHING As the world speeds ahead with data and connectivity, leaders stress that slowing down to consider the impact is essential for true advancement. [Photo: Who is Danny/Adobe Stock] BY\u00a0Tony Martignetti4 minute readShare Back in the day, philosophers weren\u2019t just deep thinkers\u2014they were the ones shaping society, questioning the status quo, and pushing humanity forward. They didn\u2019t just sit around pondering big ideas; they were the architects of real change. Fast forward to today, and while we celebrate speed, innovation, and getting things done, we often forget to pause and ask the bigger questions: Why? What if? In a world that\u2019s more complex than ever\u2014where technology is evolving at breakneck speed, society feels increasingly divided, and global challenges loom large\u2014we need to bring back deep thinking. The future depends on bold, unconventional minds willing to challenge the norm, embrace nuance, and seek real transformation instead of just quick fixes. In 2023, a World Economic Forum survey found that 50% of global leaders felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the pace of change, while only 23% believed their organizations were prepared to handle future challenges. Simultaneously, a Gallup study revealed that only 33% of employees feel engaged at work, signaling a lack of meaningful connection in professional environments. | These statistics underline a truth that feels almost countercultural in an age of immediate gratification: we are collectively running fast, but toward what? We have more data than ever before, yet we struggle to interpret it meaningfully. We are more connected digitally, yet we feel increasingly isolated. It\u2019s not just technology we need to master but the thinking required to shape its purpose and impact. I learned the power of reflection the hard way. Early in my career, I was driven by achievement\u2014always focused on the next milestone, the next goal, the next thing that needed to be done. I equated movement with progress. But at one point, despite all the success, I felt unfulfilled. It wasn\u2019t burnout exactly\u2014it was a realization that I was optimizing for speed rather than impact. I decided to do something radical: I deliberately slowed down. I took time to step back from the work itself and deeply reflect on what truly mattered to me. What kind of leader did I want to be? What legacy was I building? What problems was I solving, and were they the ones that really needed solving? The insights that emerged from that reflective period didn\u2019t just change the trajectory of my work\u2014they changed how I approached everything. I started asking better questions. Instead of just striving for efficiency, I focused on significance. Instead of merely executing, I became intentional about impact. That shift unlocked a level of innovation I hadn\u2019t accessed before\u2014not because I was doing more, but because I was thinking differently. Think about how social media started out. It was supposed to bring people together, connect the world, and make communication easier. And in many ways, it did. But along the way, it\u2019s also fueled polarization, spread misinformation, and taken a toll on mental health. The focus was all about growing fast and scaling up\u2014without much time spent questioning the bigger picture. What if, from the start, we had asked tougher questions about how these platforms might shape society? What if deep thinkers and contrarians had been part of the conversation\u2014not to slow things down, but to make sure innovation actually worked for the greater good? Big shifts in history have often come from people willing to challenge the norm. Consider Rachel Carson\u2014when she wrote Silent Spring in 1962, she wasn\u2019t just questioning pesticides; she was sparking an entire environmental movement. Or Bertrand Russell, who didn\u2019t just study philosophy and math\u2014his ideas shaped everything from education to politics to science. More recently, there\u2019s Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist who started calling out the addictive nature of tech platforms long before most people realized the impact. These kinds of thinkers remind us that progress isn\u2019t just about what we build\u2014it\u2019s about how and why we build it. To foster a culture of deep thinking and contrarian innovation, individuals and organizations can adopt the following framework: Question the Obvious: Encourage an environment where it\u2019s not only acceptable but expected to challenge assumptions. For example, instead of asking, \u201cHow do we grow faster?\u201d ask, \u201cShould we be growing in this direction at all?\u201d Shift the focus from optimization to purpose. Embrace Intellectual Humility: Outlier thinkers are not afraid to admit what they don\u2019t know. This humility creates space for exploration and allows leaders to approach problems with curiosity rather than preconceptions. Studies from Harvard Business School show that intellectual humility is correlated with better decision-making and more collaborative teams. Slow Down to Think Deeply: Allocate time for what philosopher Blaise Pascal called \u201csitting quietly in a room.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean abandoning productivity but recognizing that reflection is an investment in clearer, more impactful actions. Diversify Perspectives: Surround yourself with people who challenge your thinking rather than reinforce it. Philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that encountering opposing views sharpens understanding and fosters better solutions. Create opportunities for debate and collaboration with diverse thinkers. Focus on Long-Term Impact: Resist the allure of short-term wins. Ask questions about legacy and unintended consequences, such as \u201cWhat ripple effects could this decision have in 10 years?\u201d This lens can help avoid the pitfalls of reactive thinking and promote sustainable innovation. Bringing back deep thinking doesn\u2019t mean hitting pause on action\u2014it just means making sure that action actually matters. It\u2019s not about making more decisions; it\u2019s about making better ones. It\u2019s not about getting answers faster; it\u2019s about asking the right questions. For leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone trying to create real change, thinking differently isn\u2019t just a personal challenge\u2014it\u2019s a shared responsibility. We need the courage to ask the questions others avoid, to look beyond the obvious, and to inspire others to do the same. As Nietzsche put it, \u201cHe who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\u201d In a world full of complexity, finding our collective why might be the most important thing we do.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-28-2025WORKPLACE EVOLUTION What everyone is (still) getting wrong about DEI. Don\u2019t fall for the rhetoric against DEI being exclusive, unfair, or a distraction. [Source Photo: Fauxels/Pexels] BY\u00a0Mita Mallick6 minute readShare Recently, I overheard a conversation at a local coffee shop:\u201cThank God for the new administration and finally taking a stand against DEI,\u201d said one of the men to the other as they sipped their coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and unfair, completely ruining work. We can finally get back to business.\u201d I leaned in further, trying to listen in as I paid for my Earl Gray tea. \u201cWell . . . I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s entirely true,\u201d the other man said hesitating. \u201cI think that . . . \u201d \u201cFinally, we can get back to raising standards,\u201d the first man interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s about time! By the way, are you going to the game next week?\u201d | The other man looked uncomfortable as the conversation shifted so swiftly in a completely different direction. When I was done paying, and also done eavesdropping, I left knowing that what I heard in this coffee shop was not an isolated conversation. The backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion is playing out on the national and world stage almost every single day. And the backlash is also taking place on much smaller stages, in conversations in our conference rooms and in our hallways, among colleagues loudly and in whispers around our workplaces. And in these conversations, there\u2019s an opportunity to talk about and educate one another on what diversity, equity, and inclusion is and what diversity, equity, and inclusion is not. Here are three of the most common statements I keep hearing for the case against diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2014plus, how we can debunk these statements and continue educating one another on what is true and what is not. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is not about lowering our standards; it is about setting fair and equitable standards on how we evaluate all talent. The term \u201cDEI hire\u201d is being used to make us believe that we have lowered standards in order to hire individuals from different backgrounds and different lived experiences. In reality, \u201cDEI hire\u201d is a harmful and a hurtful phrase that leads many to believe that someone was handed a job simply because they may \u201clook different\u201d or \u201cbe different\u201d or are a \u201cquota hire.\u201d\u00a0And it has increasingly become an acceptable way to discredit, demoralize, and disrespect leaders of color. One of the key outcomes of diversity, equity, and inclusion is creating standardized processes on how we hire talent, also on who we choose to develop and promote. This includes using software tools such as Greenhouse, which helps ensure that every candidate for a role meets with the same set of interviewers, that interview questions are aligned in advance, and that there\u2019s a way to evaluate and score the interviews and debrief together as an interview team. Otherwise, we can fall prey to our biases and may hire people who look like us, think like us, and act like us, or simply hire them because we really just like them. When it comes to how we develop and promote talent, software tools such as Lattice help ensure that we set clear and reasonable goals for all employees, not just for some. We can then track progress in weekly meetings, we can give and receive coaching and feedback, and we can have a consistent framework when we evaluate talent during performance-review time. And how we evaluate talent is then connected to how we compensate employees, and ultimately who we chose to promote. Without these standardized processes, we can end up giving better performance reviews and more money to those who are the most vocal, who spend the most time managing up to us, and who we just find ourselves having more in common with. Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts help us raise standards and make sure we are getting the best out of our talent. Diversity, equity, and inclusion does not distract us from leading our businesses; in fact, diversity, equity, and inclusion is a driver of business. It\u2019s not a separate initiative that sits apart from the business; it should be integrated into everything we do in the workplace. These efforts not only help ensure that we get the best out of our talent, but it also ensures that we are able to best serve our customers. According to Procter & Gamble, the buying power of the multicultural consumer is more than $5 trillion. Procter & Gamble reminds us that it\u2019s no longer multicultural marketing; it\u2019s, in fact, mainstream marketing. There is growth to be had when we ensure we connect and authentically serve not just the multicultural consumer, but also veterans, individuals with disabilities, the LGBTQ+ community, and many more communities. Understanding their consumer needs and how your business\u2019s products and services can surprise and delight them, and enhance the quality of their lives, is an untapped competitive advantage. Companies such as E.l.f. Beauty understand this; having a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts have paid off: It has posted 23 consecutive quarters of sales growth. Over the past five years, the company also has seen its stock increase more than 700%. In contrast, since Target announced a roll back on its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, it\u2019s experienced a decline in sales.\u00a0Black church leaders are now calling on their congregations to participate in a 40-day boycott of Target. Black consumers have $2 trillion in buying power, setting digital trends and engagement. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tell corporate America that there\u2019s a consequence for turning their back on diversity,\u201d Bishop Reginald T. Jackson told USA Today. \u201cSo let us send the message that if corporate America can\u2019t stand with us, we\u2019re not going to stand with corporate America.\u201d Diversity, equity, and inclusion is not about creating an inclusive environment for a select few. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is about creating workplaces where we all have an opportunity to reach our potential and help our companies reach their potential. In my book, Reimagine Inclusion: Debunking 13 Myths to Transform Your Workplace, I tackle the myth that diversity, equity, and inclusion processes and policies only have a positive effect on a certain group of individuals. I share the \u201ccurb-cut effect,\u201d which is a prime example of this. In 1972, faced with pressure from activists advocating for individuals with disabilities, the city of Berkeley, California, installed its first official \u201ccurb cut\u201d at an intersection on Telegraph Avenue. In the words of a Berkeley advocate: \u201cthe slab of concrete heard \u2019round the world.\u201d This not only helped people in wheelchairs. It also helped parents pushing strollers, elderly with walkers, travelers wheeling luggage, workers pushing heavy carts\u2014even skateboarders and runners. People went out of their way to use a curb cut, and continue to do so. The curb-cut effect shows us that one action targeted to help one community ended up helping many more in the process. So, in our workplaces, policies that include flexible work hours and remote-work options, parental leave and caregiver assistance, time off for holidays and observances, adaptive technologies, mental health support, accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and others have a ripple effect, helping to create workplaces where everyone has an opportunity to thrive. Don\u2019t fall for the rhetoric against DEI being exclusive, unfair, or a distraction. The goal of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts has always been about leveling the playing field and ensuring we are creating workplaces where each and everyone of us have an opportunity to succeed.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-28-2025POV Disclosing my invisible illness was a risk, and I feel fortunate to have received support and understanding. But that\u2019s not the experience for all employees who disclose. [Image: fran_kie/Adobe Stock] BY\u00a0Amanda Lien6 minute readShare A recent Society for Human Resources Management study found that 47% of employees with invisible chronic conditions\u2014illnesses or disabilities that limit activities and functions but lack visible symptoms\u2014have not disclosed their conditions to their employers. When I first read this statistic, I wasn\u2019t surprised. In a world where the majority of people with invisible disabilities fear discrimination and stigma should they disclose, where is the incentive to do so? I am part of the 53% who has disclosed her invisible illness to her employer, and fortunately received support, empathy, and understanding as a result. Without a doubt, privilege is at play here. I\u2019m a white, college-educated woman with five years in my career under my belt. This affords me access to opportunities and healthcare as well as social and cultural latitudes that, unfortunately, many do not share. I wish my experience could be the norm. As I reflect on the experiences that led me to this point, I\u2019m considering how organizations and their leaders can rethink these disclosures to better support employees. For the majority of my career, I\u2019ve grappled with an acceleration in symptoms from my chronic illness, later found to be a likely result of the Lyme disease I contracted while in utero (something that impacts only a very small population of fetuses globally). My body could not sustain the consistent schedule and output needed to succeed in a traditional workplace, so I turned to self-employment, which allowed me to earn a living while managing decades of health challenges. | With my health stabilized, I began seeking traditional employment in 2023. Inevitably, the question of why I was interested in working for someone else after so long working for myself would come up. I decided to be honest and candid, letting employers form their own opinions. While my health challenges were far less acute than they once had been, I knew that my chronic illness would always be a part of my professional story\u2014so sharing that early on in the process would help me gauge reactions and understand whether an organization would be the right fit for me. Plus, I was largely targeting healthcare companies in my search, and I knew that my experiences on the patient-facing side could be an immense asset to leverage during the interview process. Still, each time I shared the reasons behind my unconventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 history with a recruiter, I felt a twist of nerves in my stomach, born of the instinctive thought that such an admission would be an overall detriment to the way I am perceived in the workplace. I\u2019m sure you can imagine how delighted I was at the number of recruiters and hiring managers who responded with empathy, kindness, and appreciation for my honesty. One recruiter thanked me for my bravery and shared that she also lives with an autoimmune disorder. Another commiserated with me about how challenging it is to live with Lyme disease, as his mother-in-law had just been diagnosed. These conversations typically segued neatly into discussions about my ability to adapt to and around my chronic illness, underscoring that I am the kind of employee (and person) who looks to leverage her lived experience toward positive outcomes for others\u2014and am committed to using all the effort possible to do so. Ultimately, my approach paid off. Since the start of 2024, I\u2019ve been able to leverage my experience as a \u201cprofessional patient\u201d (a phrase I coined as a half-joking nod to my lifetime spent in and out of doctor\u2019s offices) to better serve patients and providers through my work as a content marketing specialist for a healthcare startup. When I joined the organization for which I now work, I once again chose to share my experience living with lifelong chronic illness\u2014this time, with colleagues and my manager. That\u2019s because the internal culture is one that I knew would be accepting and accommodating. During an initial call with a new coworker welcoming me to the team, I learned that they also live with a chronic illness. The ease with which they disclosed, and the way they spoke about the organization\u2019s response\u2014that their disclosure had been met with reminders that their health is the most important thing, and encouragements to arrange elements of their work to be as accommodating as possible\u2014told me that my disclosure would likely be met similarly. As it turns out, I was right. My disclosures sounded different depending on who I was talking to; I often deployed the \u201cprofessional patient\u201d joke when in conversation with clinicians or researchers, while I got a bit more granular with the people I collaborate with often, such as my team and my manager. Regardless of how the conversation started, it always ended the same way: They were gracious and thankful for my candor, and I was likewise thankful for their understanding and willingness to hear me. Unfortunately, researchers have consistently found that my experience is a rare one. A 2021 academic analysis found that most chronically ill and disabled office workers spend a disproportionate amount of energy concealing all visible symptoms of their condition for fear of discrimination or retaliation. That means their time spent away from work isn\u2019t spent preparing to return refreshed and renewed but rather managing their symptoms so they can continue to conceal them at work. This could include, but certainly isn\u2019t limited to, sleeping 10 to 12 or more hours on the weekends, fitting in all-day IV infusions between errand-running on Saturdays, or staying in their home and not speaking to any friends or family members to manage emotional and cognitive burnout. Is it any wonder that people with disabilities are part of the subgroup found to experience 26% higher work-related burnout? Like millions of other workers across the United States, the choices I make about my career and ways of working are driven primarily by the chronic condition with which I live. Employers, founders, and managers can help alleviate this mental burden for their employees with invisible disabilities by doing these three things: As some organizations choose to downsize DEI initiatives, and even stop using words like equity altogether, it\u2019s never been more vital to ensure employees\u2014regardless of health, ability, gender, race, and more\u2014are supported so they can do their best work. I\u2019m living proof that these approaches work, and I hope that more organizations choose to follow suit.

It\u2019s well-documented that older women have been less represented in mainstream media and female actors over 40 are less likely to get work compared to their male counterparts. The stigma surrounding aging women in entertainment has been so pervasive that many actresses have felt forced to hide the natural realities of aging. Actress Naomi Watts recently revealed, \u201cI was told I would never work again if I admitted to being menopausal.\u201d Her experience is not unique\u2014many women in the industry have echoed similar sentiments, facing a shrinking pool of opportunities as they age. This year\u2019s award show season has shown that the tides are turning. We\u2019ve started to see a shift with actresses in Hollywood experiencing success later in life. One of the most discussed films of the past year, The Substance, tackles ageism head-on. And in a historic moment, Demi Moore\u201444 years into her career\u2014won her first Golden Globe at 62 and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. During the Golden Globes, we saw seven of the Best Actress nominations go to women over the age of 40. These nominations signal a growing recognition that talent doesn\u2019t have to have an expiration date. | For decades Hollywood has created the perception that women in their 40s and beyond, often when they are perimenopausal or menopausal, are past their primes and reaching the end of their careers. Moore previously shared that she almost quit acting because of ageism and how difficult it can be, particularly for women over 50. However, this cultural shift in Hollywood\u2019s acceptance and celebration of aging women could change how this demographic is represented. Now the question is, will we see other industries shift their perceptions of midlife women? Here\u2019s why they should. Before looking ahead, we have to understand how we got here. The societal stigma around aging has often overlapped with menopause, and unfortunately, that\u2019s led to a negative perception of this transitional period of a woman\u2019s life. Menopause has been widely understudied. For example, a study in Nature Aging has shown that researchers haven\u2019t properly considered menopause in 99% of studies of the biology of aging. Furthering the stigma, outdated research has led to a lack of treatment options for women experiencing menopause symptoms. The use of hormone therapy to treat menopause symptoms stopped nearly overnight due to a study showing that hormone therapy increased the risks of cancer. However, recent studies have debunked that theory and shown the benefits of hormone therapy outweigh the risks. The lack of research and controversial history around hormone therapy has hurt menopause care and prevented aging women from getting the adequate support they need. That all is changing. Companies can take a page from Hollywood\u2019s playbook by supporting and empowering its female senior talent. Women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s are some of the most experienced managers, leaders, and mentors in the workplace. As they age, they are also often at the height of their careers. McKinsey and Lean In found that female leaders contribute more to employee engagement\u2014including creating an inclusive workplace and mentorship\u2014than their male counterparts, and another McKinsey report found that organizations with gender diversity of executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability compared to those who didn\u2019t. Senior female leaders are an essential part of the workforce. Yet according to our 2022 Menopause in the Workplace report, 46% of working women experiencing menopause said their 50s have been the most difficult time in their careers. Our latest data also showed that 50% of Gen X women have experienced ageism at work. Now is a critical time for companies to step up and support. Organizations must invest in meeting the evolving needs of their midlife female workforce. Investing in menopause support for senior women leaders\u2014such as access to specialized providers, educational resources, and coverage for hormone therapy\u2014enables these women to manage their symptoms effectively, remain at peak productivity, and pave the way for the next generation of female leaders. What happens in Hollywood strongly influences culture, including workplaces. On March 2, Moore is up for her first Oscar for her critically acclaimed role. No matter who wins, it\u2019s a victory for Moore and all aging women at work. Asima Ahmad, MD, MPH, FACOG is cofounder and Chief Medical Officer of Carrot Fertility.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-27-2025WORKPLACE EVOLUTION The JPMorgan Chase CEO\u2019s insistence on in-office work is more about power and control than data. The likely results: plummeting morale, engagement, and trust. [Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images] BY\u00a0Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic3 minute readShare Although discussions about hybrid and remote work ,and forcing workers back to office full time, should be seen through the lens of data and evidence, this is rarely the case. In fact, much like DEI, remote work has become a highly political and polarizing topic. Which is why rational arguments and objective examination of the facts are generally eclipsed by emotional, intuitive, or ideological opinions. Sadly, this also means nuances are far less common than categorical or extreme positions. Consider the recent meltdown by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the corporate pioneers of ditching working from home policies to bring people back to the office. He cursed at his staff during a town hall in reaction to the news that they were signing a petition against the full-time return to the office: \u201cDon\u2019t waste time on it\u201d, he told his staff, \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people sign that f**king petition,\u201d according to a recording obtained by Reuters. \u201cDon\u2019t give me the sh*t that \u2018work from home Friday\u2019 works.\u201d To be sure, JP Morgan (like any other company) has the right to decide whichever working modality or approach they like, and employees can decide whether they object or not. Ultimately, those who don\u2019t wish to put up with it, or anything else at the company, should feel free to go elsewhere, not least since many organizations (including in banking and finance) still offer hybrid work, which most employees prefer. Likewise, any CEO or business owner should obviously decide on how and where people work, which is a key part of the job characteristics and organizational culture for employees to consider. | Furthermore, it is plausible that back-to-the-office mandates are partly intended as a trigger to get demotivated workers to quit, or at least test their commitment, motivation, and work ethic. In this sense, back-to-the-office mandates could exert some kind of Darwinian or evolutionary pressure whereby unmotivated or demotivated workers quit, leaving career-obsessed, hyper-committed, and ultra-loyal employees inside the tent \u2013 what\u2019s not to like? To be sure, maverick CEOs and executives, from Jamie Dimon to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, project such an aura of power, vision, status, and invincibility, that they have a cult-like influence on their followers (to the point that employees are more like followers than workers). It is not something that can be emulated by everyone, at least not without adverse consequences: like plummeting morale, engagement, and trust. Trust is the critical issue leaders ought to consider before emulating Dimon with back-to-the-office mandates. And there is already a crisis of trust, with recent Edelman reports suggesting that 68% of people distrust their managers/leaders (up from 56% in 2021), and various indicators highlighting a big gap between employees\u2019 self-perceived performance, and their managers\u2019 expectations. As Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadela recently noted, 85% of employees feel overworked, yet 85% of managers feel their employees are slacking. To be sure, there is something illogical about the assumption that those same employees who are assumed to be too demotivated to be productive when working from home will somehow become really engaged and productive if you force them into the office, against their will. One certain outcome if you do that, is that, if those workers don\u2019t quit (which will depend partly on the strength of the market, the economy, and alternatives) they will try very hard to pretend to work, and fake productivity, when they are forced back to the office full-time. Ideally, decisions about remote, hybrid or in-office work should be based on facts, evidence, and data. Not external data from independent scientific studies, but organizations\u2019 own internal data: after all, most organizations are awash with data on productivity, which should allow them to compare and contrast productivity differences between people who spend more or less time at the office, and ideally focus on output rather than input. Sure, it is plausible that being in the office can provide people with a stronger connection with the culture, learn from others, bond and collaborate more effectively \u2013 but then this should result in measurable improvements in what people deliver and achieve. Failing that, any mandate will be more reflective of the ego and power of the boss than an intention to help people to achieve and deliver their best, and be part of a culture that treats them like rational and mature human beings.

[Source Photo: Freepik] BY\u00a0Michel Koopman4 minute readShare Many of us want to get promoted at work, but don\u2019t often stop to consider what that means. Moving into the executive ranks often means leading the very people you once worked alongside. And while you might attract attention with stellar performance, it\u2019s not enough to secure your success as a leader.

Leadership requires a new skill set\u00a0and, just as importantly,\u00a0the respect and trust of your peers. Your colleagues\u2019 opinions can hurt or help your ability to rise to the next level.

The reality is: If your colleagues don\u2019t trust or support you, your promotion might never materialize. Worse, it might falter due to their feedback. During executive coaching engagements, I often find leaders realize that they need to start paying attention to their cross-functional relationships. Then they often ask, how do I take such initiative? Where do I start? | Below are the steps that you might want to take. Start by listing all the colleagues who are critical to your team\u2019s mission and your success as a leader.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-27-2025CAREER EVOLUTION Career experts weigh in on how laid-off federal employees can translate their skills to the private sector. [Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images] BY\u00a0Lily McDonald6 minute readShare Federal workers are facing uncertainty as President Trump and Elon Musk have already given notice to around 30,000 employees, with no signs of slowing down. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was created with the purpose of slashing the size of the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce, leaving many career government employees scrambling. For those affected, the transition out of government work can feel daunting. Many federal workers have spent years\u2014sometimes decades\u2014building careers within the public sector, where job stability and structured career paths are the norm. Many people are now grappling not only with the financial implications of losing a job but also with the emotional toll of being abruptly separated from work they found meaningful. \u201cI don\u2019t cry often, but I absolutely lost it,\u201d one anonymous Park Service worker who was let go told Fast Company recently. \u201cI worked very, very hard, in a dangerous profession, to earn the position I was in, and to have it taken away from me truly hurt.\u201d That worker and tens of thousands of others have been thrust into a competitive job market, where everything from a worker\u2019s skill set to the wording of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 may differ. | While the road ahead might seem uncertain, career experts say there are clear steps laid-off federal workers can take to position themselves for new opportunities. Making a successful transition is about understanding the private sector\u2019s expectations and adapting accordingly. The first thing to do when looking for a job is understand where the opportunities lie and what the requirements are for those roles, says Fast Company contributor and Careerminds expert Amanda Augustine. She recently helped put together this guide for laid-off federal employees navigating a career transition. She says once you find a job post that seems promising, it\u2019s about \u201cseeing where your skill sets match up.\u201d Job postings can give you ideas on how you can translate your previous experiences into terms that are being used in the job description, says Augustine. Your skill set from a government job likely won\u2019t be a perfect match for the private sector, so it\u2019s important to find a way to rephrase your strengths. Informational interviews are a way to get a better sense of where your skill set fits and what opportunities you should be looking into. This helps identify where a gap in experience might be that you can address by acquiring certification, a certain hard skill, or even a soft skill that you want to work to fill. Informational interviews can also help answer questions like what type of job you want to pursue, whether you\u2019d like to work at a nonprofit, in the private sector, or doing something entirely different. You can also ask about the best way to translate your skills. There is also a lot of information out there for job hunters to see what kinds of questions employers will ask in interviews based on the industry they are in, says John Mullinix, head of growth marketing for Ladders. \u201cOn our site, we have a list of behavioral interview questions and how you might answer those for different industries.\u201d When looking for a new job, a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is key, as it\u2019s likely the first thing a recruiter looks at. Mullinix says former federal employees should probably condense their experiences. \u201cFederal r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are often long because they want you to include every little detail. Most HR people are not going to spend that much time on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d he says. \u201cWe actually did a study. Right now they spend about six seconds looking at a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. So it\u2019s not ideal for your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to be four to six pages long. You want it to be one to two max.\u201d When deciding what to leave on and off your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the main focus should be functionality. Federal r\u00e9sum\u00e9s tend to be organized chronologically, with detailed summaries of each position. But in the private sector, this is not always what recruiters are looking for. \u201c[Job seekers] want to include the [positions] that are most relevant or hyper-relevant for the roles that they\u2019re going to apply to,\u201d Mullinix advises. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a 25-year summary. Try to keep it to the last 10 years.\u201d The language that you use on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is also important, as you want to talk about impact and achievement versus process. Including quantifiable results instead of generic descriptions of duties and responsibilities is always more valuable, Mullinix says. Employers want to know what you did and the impact you had. For employees with government clearances, unless it\u2019s relevant for the role you are applying for, Mullinix says, you don\u2019t need to include it. Government jargon does not always translate to the corporate world. When crafting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there is almost a language barrier in how government employees describe their skills in the private sector, says Augustine, noting, \u201cThe first thing to do is [think about] the civilian equivalents to any really specific government jargon that nobody outside of your field understands. There is actually also a large database online that describes different government terms and can help you understand how to strip out some of that very specific terminology to make it more generic, or in terms that a prospective employer will appreciate.\u201d Networking can seem like a daunting task, especially if you\u2019re searching for connections outside your usual area of employment. But there are steps you can take to make it seem less overwhelming. Having an updated LinkedIn profile is key. \u201cOne thing you want to do is make sure you\u2019re updating it so that it\u2019s telling the same story as your updated r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d Augustine says. \u201cBut even beyond that, it starts with just connecting with those you meet. LinkedIn is not just for the people you meet while you\u2019re working. It\u2019s [for] your friends, your family.\u201d Look up target companies and engage with their content on LinkedIn so you don\u2019t come off as cold in your outreach, Mullinix advises. Now might also be a good time to attend relevant conferences, trade shows and or other networking events to make connections with target companies. Connecting with everyone you know and sending them each a thoughtful message so they are reminded how they know you, while also identifying loose connections (like a friend of a friend), is beneficial, says Augustine. You can also identify people on LinkedIn who previously worked for the government and have already transitioned to the private sector. Think creatively about networking opportunities\u2014especially when it comes to virtual options. \u201cThere are various different ways to approach this,\u201d Augustine says. \u201cNot everybody\u2019s good in a big, crowded room. Not everybody\u2019s good face-to-face. One of the silver linings of COVID and the shutdowns is that a lot of virtual networking options opened up.\u201d Augustine says you might also consider joining efforts with a former coworker who has also been laid off.\u00a0Finding someone else to work with and share resources gives you a support system along the way, she explains. The odds of both candidates being an exact perfect fit for the exact same role are fairly slim, so you\u2019re not really in competition. The job hunt may be challenging, and you may still be mourning your old role, but the most important thing is to be patient. Augustine and Mullinix agree that doing the work and staying consistent will help you land your next job. \u201cBe patient with yourself,\u201d Mullinix says. \u201cDo the things that are hard and do them consistently, and you should see success.\u201d The super-early-rate deadline for Fast Company\u2019s Innovation by Design Awards is Friday, February 28, at 11:59 p.m. PT.

[Source Photo: Freepik] BY\u00a0Tony Martignetti3 minute readShare As a leadership advisor, I\u2019ve worked with countless executives who wrestle with failure\u2014some fearing it to the point of paralysis, others glorifying it without extracting real lessons. Failure is inevitable. Growth is optional. The difference between leaders who thrive and those who stagnate isn\u2019t the absence of failure\u2014it\u2019s how they respond to it. Fear of failure holds many organizations back, stifling creativity, slowing innovation, and fostering a culture of risk aversion. But failure, when embraced correctly, is one of the most powerful catalysts for growth. The problem? Too many leaders either avoid failure altogether or celebrate it without reflection. The key is courageous failure\u2014the kind that fuels insight, builds resilience, and sets the stage for transformative breakthroughs. Despite the lip service given to \u201cfailing fast,\u201d many leaders still operate in fear of mistakes. The reasons are clear: | When fear dominates, organizations fall into a risk-averse cycle\u2014defaulting to safe decisions, missing opportunities, and becoming stagnant. Not all failures are created equal. Reckless failures, failures due to negligence, lack of preparation, or poor execution, should be avoided. But courageous failures\u2014those that come from thoughtful experimentation, calculated risks, and boundary-pushing innovation\u2014are the seeds of progress. Leaders who want to leverage failure must foster an environment where learning is valued more than perfection. Here\u2019s how: When Sara Blakely started Spanx, she made countless mistakes in manufacturing and marketing but saw each misstep as part of the process. She credits her father for encouraging her to talk about what she failed at each day\u2014instilling a mindset of resilience and growth. Another great example is Oprah Winfrey, who, when she was fired from her first TV job, used the setback to refine her approach and ultimately built one of the most influential media empires in history. Companies that fear failure more than stagnation are already losing ground. The leaders who fail forward faster\u2014learning, iterating, and growing\u2014will define the future. So, before your next big decision, ask yourself: Am I playing it safe to avoid failure, or am I willing to take a calculated risk that could lead to something extraordinary? Failure isn\u2019t the opposite of success\u2014it\u2019s the bridge to it. The only real mistake is not learning from the ones you make along the way.

This is how leaders should think about the future. [Source Photo: Freepik] BY\u00a0Wema Hoover5 minute readShare The contributions of Black Americans built the nation\u2019s economic foundation, sustained industries, and shaped countless communities. Yet, even today, disparities in the workplace persist, limiting the opportunities available to Black professionals, which has been exacerbated by the recent White House Executive Order to terminate all Federal DEI programs and positions. Black employees comprise 12.8% of the workforce but hold just 7% of managerial positions. In senior leadership, representation drops to 4\u20135%. These numbers are beyond dismal and reveal more than gaps in representation\u2014they reflect systemic barriers that prevent Black talent from reaching their full potential.\u00a0Yet despite the intention of DEI programs to gain access to the many talents and skills of the Black community, a false narrative has been created that DEI gives unfair advantages to Blacks and people of color. When the reality is that Black Americans have not been the greatest benefactor of DEI compared to white women and other minority groups. It\u2019s clear the contributions, abilities, and innovations that Black employees bring to the workforce will continue to be underutilized and untapped. This is exacerbated by the lack of recognition of Black talent, which needs to be leveraged and harnessed effectively as a critical part of the global talent pool to develop and maintain a high-performing workforce and ensure the best and brightest regardless of differences are given access to opportunities. Unfortunately, this is not the first time in history where Blacks have been denied access to education, jobs, and opportunities. Despite this, the impact of the Black worker has strengthened America and cannot be denied.\u00a0Statistics or examples alone can\u2019t capture the full picture. Each number, reference, and invention represent a person with dreams, ambition, and a relentless drive to succeed. This story is about resilience, transformation, and the potential for change. | The history of African Americans in the workforce is deeply rooted in resilience, ingenuity, and advancement. From domestic laborers and factory workers to trailblazers who were innovators that changed the face of modern medicine and technology to savvy business leaders that enacted a difference style and approach to driving business impact and change\u2014each generation has elevated themselves by challenging and overcoming the stereotypes and ill-fitted beliefs of our community to persevere and progress. Through mentorship, networking, and sharing past and present experiences, Black employees have paved the way to build upon our achievements and we understand of how to navigate during uncertain times.\u00a0These insights have given us the value of hard work, and the belief that the pursuit of excellence will eventually break down barriers and open doors. This mindset has shaped how I and many other Black professionals show up in the world and maintain a core responsibility to educate, inspire, and share our career journeys and paths to create opportunities for others. Throughout my professional career, I\u2019ve had countless conversations with Black professionals who share their experience about being the \u201conly one\u201d in the room\u2014whether in leadership meetings, boardrooms, or professional networks. They describe how exhausting it can be to always advocate for their community, lead their work while also pushing for change for other marginalized groups.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-26-2025WORK LIFE In this climate, it\u2019s understandable to wonder if you should downplay your DEI work on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. [Source Photo: Freepik] BY\u00a0Kathleen Davis3 minute readShare Welcome to\u00a0Pressing Questions,\u00a0Fast Company\u2019s work-life advice column. Every week, deputy editor Kathleen Davis, host of\u00a0The New Way We Work\u00a0podcast, will answer the biggest and most pressing workplace questions. Q: Should I take my DEI work off of my r\u00e9sum\u00e9?A: This is such a timely question and such a fraught one. In the last month, President Trump has issued a flurry of executive orders dismantling DEI initiatives in the federal government, military, and public schools. Trump also revoked an executive order from 1965, which addressed discriminatory hiring practices across federal contractors, and in the same executive action, he directed federal agencies to open investigations into private sector companies to end DEI programs that \u201cconstitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\u201d Add to all of that the 2023 Supreme Court decision overturning affirmative action, which sparked\u00a0a wave of lawsuits\u00a0from conservative activists aimed at DEI efforts across the public sector and private companies. | Given all of this, it\u2019s not surprising that a lot of companies are renaming, scaling back, or ending their diversity programs. So in this climate, I understand the inclination to remove or downplay your DEI work on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 if you are looking for a job.But, as someone who has covered the evolution of DEI work and\u00a0understands how crucial it is to employee well-being, team dynamics, innovation, and company success, I would never advise anyone to downplay their DEI work on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Aside from the moral imperative to stand behind this important work, it\u2019s just never a good idea to lie on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Leaving off your work on an employee resource group, for example, may feel more like a borderline omission. But if your job title included DEI, changing it or leaving it off of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a deceit that is easy for a future employer to discover. The other reason why I think it\u2019s a mistake to remove mentions of DEI work from your r\u00e9sum\u00e9: If this is work that\u2019s important to you, do you really want to work for a company that wouldn\u2019t hire you because you worked in DEI?All of that said, I\u2019m not naive about the need to find a job if you are out of work. Ideally we could all feel connected to our company\u2019s mission, but in an environment where businesses are afraid of legal retaliation, that can difficult.\u00a0While I don\u2019t think you should alter your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to remove your past DEI work, you can use your cover letter to address the current climate and how those same values can still have a place at companies.

[Source Photo: Freepik] BY\u00a0Judith Humphrey4 minute readShare If you are career-minded, you may think applying for a loftier position in another company is the best route. In fact half of millennials expect to leave their current company within a year. But it\u2019s not always the right move. Advancing in your present company may be a smarter move. You already know the culture and the people. If you enjoy them, who is to say that you\u2019d find something better elsewhere? Also, some companies reward loyalty. And why would you want to compete with hundreds of applicants in a chaotic job market? If you are staying, hone your strategy. Follow these five steps to boost your likelihood of advancing. First, seek out high-profile assignments. You want to be seen as a go-getter. | Do this, and your boss and other leaders in the firm will regard you as a creative, productive worker with aspirational goals. I\u2019m not talking about doing extra grunt work. I mean seizing opportunities to come up with innovative ideas and initiatives that impress others. Commit to projects that reach beyond your department. You\u2019ll open the door to new relationships with potential bosses in other departments. For example, you might lead a fundraising project, or help another executive with her presentation, or volunteer to speak at an International Women\u2019s Day event in your company. It\u2019s important to build your network within the firm. You\u2019ll meet and gain the favor of leaders who recognize your talent and initiative. That can lead to important new relationships with strategically placed individuals. Take part in activities where you can meet senior leaders. These include conferences, sports such as company golf tournaments, leadership forums, and training sessions. If there is someone in the company you admire and think you\u2019d like to work for, find a way to get onto their calendar. You might have a mutual interest. Or, you might invite them to speak to your team as a guest expert. Be creative in setting up that meeting. Once you\u2019ve made that contact, broach the discussion about reporting to them. There might be an advertised position or not. Either way, if you want to work in that department go for it, set up a meeting, and prepare to pitch yourself. If you\u2019re job hunting in your present company, it might seem like overkill to prepare for each encounter. But you must do so\u2014even for conversations with people who may not have a job to offer you at the moment. They may be able to recommend you to others. Your preparation should include a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that is polished and geared to opportunities in the company. If someone has agreed to meet with you, you\u2019ll also want to prepare speaking notes in the form of a well-crafted statement explaining what kind of position you are looking for and why you feel ready for it. And don\u2019t forget to write a thank-you note after the meeting. For guidelines on how to create a strong networking pitch, see the chapter on \u201cPitching Yourself inside Your Company.\u201d in my book, The Job Seeker\u2019s Script. You\u2019ll discover how to sell yourself within your present company. It\u2019s important to get along with your boss. But don\u2019t let that person slow you down if you want to advance. A manager who praises your work may not want to see you move to another department. One woman I know had an opportunity to take a VP position elsewhere in the company. That would have been a big step forward since she was a director. But her boss pleaded \u201cdon\u2019t go . . . I need you here.\u201d So, she stayed, and after a decade she is still a director. If you have a boss who encourages you to pursue next steps within the company, be thankful. But be wary of a bad boss who tries to block ascent. All the more reason to develop strong network ties that will allow you to get around that roadblock. As you have conversations with others and seek to move up the corporate ladder, never complain about your current position. A bad boss is, of course, only one reason for seeking a new position. There are many others. But if you are looking to move up because you are unhappy with your current manager or some other aspect of your job, keep that to yourself. No one wants to hire a complainer.\u00a0They fear it might be a personality trait. Instead, focus on what you like about your present role, what you have learned from your boss, what a great team of professionals you\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with. And then look ahead and share your excitement about moving to the next role, whatever it may be. That kind of self-portrayal will get you a potential job offer and it will help you build your career.

        "text": "LOGIN 02-25-2025IMPACT COUNCIL If only brands, agencies, and platform companies could avail themselves of a single individual who could manage the whole funnel. Wait\u2014that role exists. [Photo: Getty Images] BY\u00a0Tim Ringel3 minute readShare The Fast Company Impact Council is a private membership community of influential leaders, experts, executives, and entrepreneurs who share their insights with our audience. Members pay annual membership dues for access to peer learning and thought leadership opportunities, events and more. For the last decade, chief marketing officers (CMOs) haven\u2019t felt as appreciated and necessary as they once were. But that may be changing\u2014I should stress \u201cmay.\u201d I\u2019m thinking of the 2024 CMO Tenure Study by marketing consultancy Spencer Stuart. They\u2019ve been issuing this study for two decades. Four years ago, the length of CMO tenure tightened to its smallest interval in more than a decade. In Spencer Stuart\u2019s latest report, the average time spent by Fortune 500 CMOs in that job post in 2023 was 4.2 years, unchanged from 2022. While I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cflat is the new up,\u201d stabilization after years of decline is somewhat positive. A bit more context: Conventional wisdom has suggested that CMOs turn over more often than other C-suite leaders. But Spencer Stuart\u2019s analysis shows that CMO tenure is just under the 4.6-year average for all C-suite leaders such as chief operating officers, chief revenue officers, chief technology officers, etc. | Still, CMOs are living in an \u201cera of less,\u201d according to a Gartner Marketing Practice study.\u00a0 Issued in May 2024, around the same time as the Spencer Stuart report, the GMP study notes that \u201cin the four years preceding the pandemic, average marketing budgets were 11% of overall revenue. In the four years since, they\u2019ve dropped to an anemic 8.2%.\u201d The roles of marketing and advertising appear more diminished than ever before. Meanwhile, ad agencies and brand marketing departments are under greater pressure and scrutiny to prove effectiveness. The essential quality of the CMO\u2019s job is akin to an orchestra conductor; but instead of musicians, the role is to make sure companies and individuals act seamlessly and complementary. But it\u2019s not. There are reasons for that, good and bad. An ethos of efficiency has served as the defining, underlying feature of the advertising business for the last 25 years. The \u201960s were about pushing the boundaries of creativity. Advertisers and agencies wanted to impress everybody with the ideas, images, and messages bursting from Madison Avenue. However, that shifted: The 21st century has been about personalization, speed\u2014and above all\u2014cost savings. But it takes a larger advertising team to expertly handle all parts of the marketing funnel from discovery to purchase while simultaneously instilling brand loyalty. The demands are, in fact, too complex for one agency, let alone one individual. As a result, specialists have divided the responsibilities associated with the multiple consumer touchpoints that need to be checked off. So much for efficiency. If only there were a single individual who could organize, synthesize, and prioritize all those crucial tasks. Oh, right. That\u2019s what the CMO does. It\u2019s what the CMO has always done. Companies are increasingly recognizing this. There is solid value in developing marketing leadership from within. In 2023, 74% of CMOs of the top 100 advertisers were serving in their first corporate-level CMO role\u2014the highest percentage since Spencer Stuart began tracking this data in 2016. Moreover, 59% of these CMOs were promoted from inside their companies. This move toward internal promotion signals an \u201cah-ha\u201d moment as the CMO role is rediscovered as the truly efficient solution to advertising\u2019s largest problems. Institutional knowledge and recognizable authority are virtues worth keeping.We might be witnessing a maturing perspective on marketing leadership. Organizations are investing in succession planning and management development specifically for the CMO role. There\u2019s even a higher opinion for the general marketing and management acumen a CMO possesses, Spencer Stuart data indicates. When external hires are needed, companies are showing greater flexibility, with 43% of CMOs recruited for Fortune 500 companies in 2023 coming from different industries, up from 37% in 2022. Despite facing significant budget constraints\u2014with 64% of CMOs reporting insufficient funds to execute their 2024 strategy per Gartner\u2014there\u2019s optimism about the potential of generative AI to expand marketing\u2019s impact beyond traditional resource limitations. This technological evolution could help CMOs overcome the \u201cera of less\u201d while delivering more value. As companies focus on developing their marketing leadership pipeline, they have an opportunity to increase diversity at the top by identifying high-potential leaders early and creating smoother development paths. Not only would that strengthen the CMO role, it also ensures marketing leadership better reflects the diverse audiences they serve, which helps build brand affection. When consumers associate a brand with trust and other positive qualities, the path to performance and purchases is more immediate and direct. The intersecting lines of technology, branding, advertising, and sales all converge at the CMO\u2019s desk. Perhaps it\u2019s time agencies, platform companies, and the brands themselves showed more trust and value in the CMO role after all. Tim Ringel is global CEO of Meet The People.

Demonstrators rally outside the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in Washington, D.C., during a protest against billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading President Donald Trump\u2019s drive to shrink the federal government, February 5, 2025. [Photo: Reuters/Nathan Howard/File Photo] BY\u00a0Reuters6 minute readShare Tens of thousands of U.S. government workers have been fired in recent weeks, according to a Reuters tally of announcements tracking President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to shrink the federal workforce. So far, few indications of those lost jobs have appeared in the various formal measures of the U.S. job market. Economists will be keeping an eye on the data because federal government hiring has been a steady contributor to overall U.S. employment growth as the pace of private-sector hiring has eased. Over the last two years through January, the ranks of non-U.S. Postal Service federal workers as a share of overall payroll employment has edged up to 1.52% from 1.47%. Despite that rise, the federal civilian worker share of total U.S. employment is near its historic low of 1.4% from late 2000. The federal workforce share peaked at just over 4% in the early 1950s. | Also, Trump\u2019s cuts \u2013 being carried out under the direction of Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 have not just been aimed at those directly on government payrolls but also at private companies and individuals performing contract work for the government. A 2020 Brookings Institution study estimated that for every one federal employee there are two contractors. With that in mind, Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated that with a \u201cconsensus\u201d estimate of ultimately 300,000 DOGE-related federal job cuts, the total employment reduction could be closer to 1 million.

        "text": "Feb 28, 2025 Indian headline indices ended Friday with deep cuts as US economic woes weighed on the Street. The world\u2019s largest economy grew at a 2.3% annualised rate last quarter after accelerating at a 3.1% pace in the July-September quarter. The sentiments showed on domestic markets with significant selling pressure seen in the IT stocks. While Nifty fell by 420.35 points or 1.86% to close at 22,124.70, the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex finished at  73,198.10, declining by 1414.33 points or 1.90%. Here are the stocks that saw action today: Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of IndusInd Bank were the top Nifty losers as they fell by Rs 74.40 or 7% to settle at Rs 972.30. The fall was amid a widespread selling in the overall markets where bank and financial stocks witnessed significant correction. Image Source: ETMarkets.com The weak economic data in the US triggered a fall in most IT stocks taking the Nifty index down by over 4%. All 10 stocks ended in the green with the highest fall seen in Tech Mahindra and Wipro. They ended 6.4% and 5.4% lower, respectively. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Auto stocks were other major losers which have been on a downward spiral since the news of Tesla entering Indian shores has been doing the rounds. The Nifty auto index closed 3.9% down with all 15 stocks closing in the red. Ashok Leyland and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) were top losers and fell nearly 5%, each. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Smallcap counter Redington was among top smallcap losers, settling with declines of over 10% at Rs 225.20 on the NSE. The correction was amid a wider selling in most smallcap stocks. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Shares of Granules India extended their losing streak on Friday falling by over 11% in two sessions. The company's Gagillapur facility was given a USFDA warning letter based on its inspection conducted in August 2024. The FDA has not indicated any further escalation, the company filing said. The stock today ended at Rs 459.40 on the NSE, down by Rs 47.55 or 9.38% over Thursday closing price. Image Source: ETMarkets.com Thanks For Reading!",

        "title": "US-UK trade deal: Would an agreement change anything?",
        "text": "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions. It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position. Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more. There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU. So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards. But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era. It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU. It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table. In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office. The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\". Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here. This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces. While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit. The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago. Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues. This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here. The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world. Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe? There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing. And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries. That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization. The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them. The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one. Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says she is \"minded to approve\" the expansion, which faces opposition. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. The White House said the metal was vital to national security. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Lloyds Bank says app issues fixed after payday IT issue",
        "text": "Banking apps have once again been hit by IT issues on payday in the UK. Lloyds Bank and Halifax apps went down on Friday morning, according to thousands of user reports to platform outage monitor Downdetector. Users also reported technical issues affecting access to the TSB and Bank of Scotland apps. The number of reports flagging problems with the apps has since declined. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson has told the BBC that the Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland apps and online banking services are now working as normal. The British banking giant apologised for the issues in an earlier statement. It is the second time in 2025 that banking apps users have encountered problems on payday, after a Barclays app outage affected UK customers in January. Which? retail editor Reena Sewraz said the IT problems \"could cause real headaches for thousands of customers\". \"Some people may miss important bill payments, find themselves unable to pay for essential services or risk going overdrawn, all of which could have serious consequences,\" she said. One user told the Lloyd's Bank social media account on X that they could not access their business account to pay their staff. Another said in a post tagging Lloyds Bank's X account they had been told to transfer funds into their account, but could not due to the issues affecting its app. \"Your new cards have no phone numbers on and I'm nowhere near a branch,\" they wrote - adding \"help!\". Barclays customers told the BBC last month that their bank's outage, lasting several days for some, left them unable to purchase essentials or make vital transactions. \"I could cry. I changed to you when Barclays had a major breakdown on payday,\" one X user told Lloyds in a reply to one of their posts on Friday. \"Now this month you've gone down on payday,\" they added. The Treasury Committee recently wrote to the bosses of nine banks asking for information about the scale and impact of IT failures on customers. The latest bank IT problems highlight concerns about a shift towards mobile and internet banking services impeding peoples' access to physical cash and bank branches. Martin Quinn, the director of campaign group Campaign for Cash, said Friday's banking app issues demonstrated society's over-reliance on technology. \"This proves that now more than ever a strong bank branch network [is needed], as when outages happen, we need face-to-face banking,\" he told the BBC. Disability rights groups are also calling for access to physical cash to be protected. Meanwhile, Patrick Burgess, a cyber-security expert with the Chartered Institute for IT, said the Lloyds issues on Friday showed \"how fragile parts of the legacy banking system still are\". High street banks still rely on \"outdated infrastructure\" that may face extra strain in moments of high demand, such the month-end, he added. Professor Markos Zachariadis, chair of financial technology at the University of Manchester, told the BBC that if financial institutions cannot keep pace with demand or deal with technical issues, \"the economy will suffer many times at a high cost\". It may also add to pressures on consumer trust in traditional banks, says Shilpa Doreswamy of GFT Technologies. \"It is becoming imperative for incumbent banks to urgently modernise their IT infrastructure or continue to face an accelerating loss of confidence - and maybe customers too,\" she told the BBC.

The firm says it is \"really sorry\" for the problem, which comes on the busy shopping day Black Friday. Anne Boden says nobody believed a \"5ft tall Welsh woman in her mid-50s\" could achieve what she has. More than half of the West Midlands' bank branches have closed since 2015, prompting Age UK warnings. The branch in Woburn Sands will be replaced by a cashless service in a nearby garden centre. Marcus Gear is warning others after he was tricked into transferring money using his banking app. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Donald Trump: UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary'",
        "text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer. Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK. Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\". Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes. The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine. Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". He said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. He later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday. The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK. Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\" \"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said. \"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\" In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US. In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way. However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\". \"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\". He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Georgia's richest man said to be moving funds to avoid sanctions",
        "text": "Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code. Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change \u2013 which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia \u2013 may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream. \"Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,\" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze. With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies. Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\". Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country. Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police. In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year. There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili. The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\". TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. \"All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories,\" says Beso Namchavadze. He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia. In January of this year, paintings and other artwork worth nearly $500m were imported into Georgia, according to data published by the Ministry of Finance. Many believe the artwork was from Mr Ivanishvili's valuable collection. \"For everybody who knows him it's pretty clear that this is something that he values the most out of all the assets, and all the wealth, that he has,\" says Tina Khidasheli, Georgia's ex-defence minister and the head of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea. \"He is going to bring paintings back and he does not want to pay tax on it.\" The head of Georgia's parliamentary committee on finance and budget, Paata Kvijinadze, recently defended the tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia. \"If anyone benefited from this law, I am happy about it,\" he said in a post on social media. \"This is exactly what the law was meant to be: to bring companies from offshore zones and attract more investments into the country\". In response to the proposed UK sanctions, Georgia's ruling party issued a statement defending Mr Ivanishvili, saying that a threat of sanctions was \"without any foundation\" against the party founder who brought \"democratic breakthrough to the country\". Separately, Mr Ivanishvili's lawyer announced last month that his client is suing Swiss bank Julius Baer for, among other reasons, misinterpreting \"the so-called\" American sanctions, which the lawyer described as \"political blackmail\". The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members. For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money. Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the \"global war party\", or \"deep state\", originate in his long-standing financial grievances. Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. \"Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues.\" Experts say that even though Mr Ivanishvili's current official position is the honorary chairman of the ruling party, there is a clear understanding that he remains the number one person in Georgian politics. Sanctions against him are therefore seen as sanctions against the entire government. Nika Gilauri was prime minister of Georgia from 2009 to 2012. He now leads a private company called Reformatics, which advises governments around the world on economic reform. Mr Gilauri says that Georgia's continuing political instability and international isolation is negatively impacting the economy. \"We are seeing a very negative effect on FDI, foreign direct investment, if you take nine months of 2024 compared to nine months of 2023, we have a 40% drop. So going forward this is going to continue to get worse.\" But the Georgian government paints a different picture. Last month Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze signed a $6bn inward investment agreement with UAE property group Emaar. Levan Davitashvili, the Minister of Economy described it as the \"largest foreign investment deal\" in decades, which was expected to contribute 1.5% growth to the economy. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has even suggested that 10% growth was now \"absolutely realistic\" for the Georgian economy. But recently published research by Policy and Management Consulting Group (PMCG), a Georgian research firm, said that the prospect for the next six months was \"extremely negative\". It highlighted the impact of the continuing political turmoil, and said that the suspension of EU membership talks \"was negatively viewed by all surveyed economists\". Mr Gilauri of Reformatics says their own analysis shows that Georgia's economic growth this year will be zero. \"Going forward, we will have a budgetary problem, a currency exchange problem. We will have an inflation problem. We will have a jobs problem, a job creation problem, and we will have economic decline problem. \"Having new elections is the only way forward for the country as well as for Bidzina Ivanishvili personally.\" All of those taken to Tbilisi were Georgian nationals who had been subject to deportation orders. The woman, from the state of Georgia, has been forced to give up custody of the child. At least 13 people have died after a storm hit south-eastern parts of the US. Mzia Amaglobeli is accused of slapping a police chief but her detention has made her a symbol of resistance. Snow and freezing rain hits parts of the deep south, closing highways and airports and prompting a first-ever blizzard warning in southwest Louisiana. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Germany\u2019s car industry crisis - this is what may fix it",
        "text": "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery? When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away. Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school. \"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry. \"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\" Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role. Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs. It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show. All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast. The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large. \"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it. Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\" Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution. With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines. However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated. And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market. \"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz. \"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\" While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive. Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole. For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA. The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power. The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz. And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs. \"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\" It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt. \"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\" What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut. Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades. Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\". Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector. In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies. Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country. Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere. One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand. But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market. \"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition. All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings. Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars. According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field. German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat. \"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz. Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says. \"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with. \"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\" So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole. \"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\". He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says. Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month. \"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says. \"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?' For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\" He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\" For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.

        "title": "Trump's tariffs: Debate on if this means the end of the post-war free trade world",
        "text": "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip. The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade. Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era? I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers. Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people. Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him? Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons. Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days. Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years. He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs. DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals? JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards. Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries. DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this? JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat. So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies. We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system. We need a new system. MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history. Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences. One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support. Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners. DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices. MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually. Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices. One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children. DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims? JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products. But I want to go back to consumer prices. People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases. What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree. The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy. DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s? MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity. It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them. Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago. JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith. DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality? MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers. If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with? If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war. So the spillover effects could be very, very negative. DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth? JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains. The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world. So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.

        "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
        "text": "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies. Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid. \"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city. \"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\" Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub. And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year. By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%. This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy. \"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year. Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year. \"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds. That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy. Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses. \"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School. Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\". Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%. Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage. At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills. Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil. \"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\" The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU. The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area. \"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\" Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008. Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this. This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation. Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\". The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon. The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern. Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output. Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\". In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation. With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth. Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help? Kwek Leng Beng, the chairman of property giant CDL, has accused his son of plotting a boardroom coup. It comes as Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok's future remains uncertain in the US. Boss Jensen Huang responds to concerns about an AI bubble sparked by Chinese firm DeepSeek.

        "title": "British pharma company GSK pauses diversity work citing Trump orders | GSK | The Guardian",
        "text": "London-based FTSE 100 firm reviewing its policies, saying it is obliged to comply because US is its No 1 market The British pharma company GSK has paused diversity activities for UK workers, claiming that it is obliged to do so in response to executive orders by the US president, Donald Trump. The FTSE 100 company has also scrubbed references to \u201cdiversity\u201d from its website. GSK is led by Emma Walmsley, one of the few women to head a FTSE 100 company. Donald Trump took aim at efforts to increase the representation of minorities in workplaces soon after starting his second term in the White House. His executive orders tried to ban federal agencies and contractors from having diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets. The orders have faced challenges in US courts, but that has not stopped a procession of American companies, including Goldman Sachs, Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, Ford, Amazon and the Facebook owner Meta from rushing to remove their own diversity policies. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investor, on Friday joined the crowd, saying it would abandon targets of increased representation of minorities in its workforce. However, the move by GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, has acted despite being a British company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in central London. Internal communications said the company was obliged to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders because the US is the company\u2019s largest market and the US government is its No 1 customer. GSK argued on Thursday that it could raise the potential pay package for Walmsley to nearly \u00a322m in three years\u2019 time in order to compete with US rivals. The British company\u2019s position on diversity contrasts with others. Notably, its British pharma rival AstraZeneca, which also employs thousands of workers in the US, has not made any changes to its diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The GSK communications said that all diversity and inclusion policies were being reviewed. In the meantime, there is to be a pause on diversity and inclusion activities, although it is understood that efforts to promote diversity in clinical trials \u2013 vital to understand medicines\u2019 effects across varied populations \u2013 will not be affected. References to \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d, present as late as 19 February according to the Internet Archive, were changed to merely \u201cinclusion\u201d on one section of GSK\u2019s website. Mentoring groups for women have been put on hold, as has a social mobility programme in the UK that works with students from less-privileged socioeconomic groups to support them entering the workplace, according to sources. Charitable activities with a diversity element are also under review. A GSK company spokesperson said: \u201cWe are strongly committed to GSK being an inclusive workplace where our people can be themselves, and have their different perspectives, experiences and characteristics valued, because this helps everyone perform at their best. \u201cWe have to ensure we remain compliant with the law in the countries in which we operate, including the US. This is why we have paused some activities to review them. To be clear, this does not necessarily mean they will be stopped but we may need to make some changes. We are consulting and talking to our people about all of this.\u201d Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The changes have caused disquiet among some of GSK\u2019s UK staff. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: \u201cIt\u2019s seriously disappointing to learn of GSK taking this step. It\u2019s likely to go down very poorly with many of GSK\u2019s longest-standing investors, clients and stakeholders. Companies that abandon policies that promote equal opportunities will likely lose talent over time and fail to attract the best. It\u2019s a shortsighted approach with significant risk.\u201d A GSK spokesperson added: \u201cThe company completely rejects this characterisation of our actions.\u201d Sarah Tahamtani, head of the employment practice at Clarion, a UK law firm, said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a situation where a UK employer would be bound by an executive order in the US.\u201d However, she added that Trump\u2019s orders may shift \u201cthe general mood\u201d with regard to diversity and discrimination, which could affect how UK companies operate.",

        "title": "Cutting \u2018waste\u2019 or more tax: how Reeves could appease OBR in spring statement | Economic policy | The Guardian",
        "text": "A weak economy, higher borrowing costs and increased defence spending will mean tough decisions Rachel Reeves is rapidly running out of wriggle room amid higher borrowing costs, stubborn inflation, a sluggish economy and a promise to find billions of pounds for additional defence spending. On Tuesday, the chancellor will get the final verdict from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) before her 26 March spring statement on whether her fiscal rules have been smashed apart by increasing financial pressures since last autumn\u2019s budget. After a whistle-stop tour of South Africa earlier this week for meetings with G20 finance ministers to emphasise the importance of increasing defence spending, it is widely expected Reeves will be flying back to bad news. The OBR\u2019s final \u201cpre-measures forecast\u201d will be key because it will show the chancellor how much headroom, if any, is left within her self-imposed fiscal rules. It will therefore underpin any action she must take. Reeves\u2019s policy decisions will then be incorporated into the final economic and fiscal outlook report published alongside the spring statement. Back at the October budget, Reeves had held back \u00a39.9bn of headroom in reserve against her primary fiscal rule \u2013 requiring day-to-day spending to be matched by tax receipts in the fifth year of the forecast. However, the government has been borrowing more than the OBR forecast, and Britain\u2019s debt servicing costs have risen sharply on financial markets. Analysts at Capital Economics expect this could whittle down the chancellor\u2019s headroom from \u00a39.9bn to \u00a32.8bn. However, there are other factors that will influence the OBR\u2019s assessment. Growth in the UK economy has been weaker than forecast in October, having narrowly avoided a recession in the second half of 2024. The OBR is widely expected to nearly halve its 2% growth forecast for 2025 closer to 1%. In addition to the rise in borrowing costs, analysts say a weaker growth outlook could eradicate the chancellor\u2019s headroom. The danger was highlighted by the Bank of England after it halved its GDP growth forecast for 2025 from 1.5% to 0.75%. Inflation is also expected to stick at higher levels than anticipated by the OBR. Back in October, the watchdog had forecast 2.6% inflation in 2025. The Bank now expects it to peak at 3.7% in late summer. Business leaders have cautioned Reeves\u2019s autumn budget has added to the economic headwinds, arguing the \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions will force them to cut jobs or raise prices. However, Reeves told the Guardian last week there would be no U-turns on the autumn budget. \u201cI\u2019m not resiling from that budget in any way. It was a budget that enabled us to start cutting NHS waiting lists, put more money into defence and return stability to our economy.\u201d The Treasury said the fiscal rules were \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d, in a signal that an OBR forecast showing a breach would lead the chancellor to cut spending or raise taxes to ensure they were still being met. With Reeves having promised not to raise the Treasury\u2019s three biggest revenue raisers \u2013 income tax, VAT and national insurance \u2013 and under pressure to fund a revival in public services, that will be tough. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Charlie Bean, an ex-member of the OBR and a former Bank deputy governor, said it would be better for the chancellor to either allow borrowing to rise \u2013 breaking the fiscal rule \u2013 or to announce a broad-based tax rise. \u201cA more adult way of proceeding would be for a chancellor to say: \u2018OK, well I am now overshooting my rule by a few billion or whatever, but we know forecasts bounce around. I haven\u2019t completed the spending review and I will come back to this in the autumn\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, simply saying that probably won\u2019t cut the ice at the current juncture \u2013 and in particular given her credibility personally has probably been somewhat weakened.\u201d Showing the lack of wriggle room, Keir Starmer\u2019s promise to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 involved cutting the international aid budget, after Reeves warned \u201ctough decisions\u201d were needed to stick to the fiscal rules. To counter the rise in debt servicing costs and a sluggish economy hitting the government finances, Reeves has indicated she will prioritise spending cuts and \u201crooting out waste\u201d. This could mean tougher restraint on public spending in the later years of the parliament, although details are still being worked on for the spending review \u2013 due to be completed in June. Benefit cuts could also be announced, to the dismay of charities and Labour backbenchers. Reeves had promised late last year there would be no more tax rises, aiming to assuage business anger after her autumn budget. But the strength of her language on this point has softened in recent weeks. The Financial Times also reported that Reeves was leaving the door open to changes \u2013 including a possible extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds beyond 2028. Reeves said last week that she was committed \u201cnot to be repeating anything like that I had to do in October,\u201d when she announced \u00a340bn of tax rises, but did not rule out smaller revenue-raising measures. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the chancellor is going to box themselves in to the extent that they are going to rule out ever making changes to taxes again. I\u2019m not going to fall into that trap,\u201d she said.",

        "title": "Cash Isas: pressure grows against rumoured move to \u00a34,000 allowance | Isas | The Guardian",
        "text": "Research shows strong support for keeping tax-free accounts in their current form with \u00a320,000 annual limit A campaign to \u201csave\u201d cash Isas gathered pace this week, with research published showing strong support for the savings accounts. However, data was also issued that investment firms said showed UK savers were \u201cpaying the price\u201d for playing it safe because putting money into the stock market can generate much higher returns. With discussions taking place about the future of cash Isas, some have cast doubt on the idea that cutting tax breaks on the accounts would prompt more people to invest their cash in British companies, as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seems to be hoping. Instead, the suggestion from some providers is that it could merely intensify British investors\u2019 love affair with big US tech companies and lead to even more UK cash being ploughed into the shares of companies such as Apple, Amazon, Meta (owner of Facebook), Microsoft and Tesla. The government is being lobbied by some fund managers to scale back the tax breaks on cash Isas, which are used by almost 8 million savers each year. Last week it emerged that ministers are considering a proposal to cut the maximum amount that people can put into them from \u00a320,000 a year to \u00a34,000. Organisations such as the Building Societies Association (BSA) are spearheading the campaign to save cash Isas, which has gathered support from others in the industry. On Wednesday the consumer champion Martin Lewis told a committee of MPs: \u201cI\u2019ve already had people telling me they are worried about what\u2019s going on, so they are going to withdraw from cash Isas, which is clearly not the right thing to do.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should reduce the cash Isa limit.\u201d The government has not ruled out cutting the limit and, when asked about the proposal, Reeves appeared to lean into this thinking when she said: \u201cAt the moment there is a \u00a320,000 limit on what you can put into either cash or equities, but we want to get that balance right.\u201d She added that she wanted to create \u201cmore of a culture in the UK of retail investing like you have in the US, to earn better returns for savers and support the ambition to grow the economy\u201d. The two main types of Isa are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa. Consumers can spread their money across different types of Isa or pay into only one. At the moment savers can, if they wish, stash up to \u00a320,000 a year in one or more cash Isas. This allowance is a lot more generous than it used to be: for almost a decade the cash Isa limit was \u00a33,000 a year. Some investment firms want the government to put more emphasis on investing in the stock market, which would align with its mission to boost economic growth and could deliver higher returns to individuals over the long term. But the big savings providers have pledged to fight any attempts to rein in cash Isas. This week, the BSA issued research showing that 73% of UK adults with cash Isas are opposed to the government scrapping the accounts or reducing what you can pay in; some people might be surprised that the figure wasn\u2019t even higher. Meanwhile, two-thirds (67%) of cash Isa savers said they knew about stocks and shares Isas, and a further 30% had heard of them, but 90% said it was important to them that they get back at least the amount they had saved or invested \u2013 a guarantee that can only be provided with cash savings. Robin Fieth, the BSA chief executive, says that \u201cit\u2019s clear many people are making a conscious decision to save in cash rather than stocks and shares\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe will continue to press the chancellor to listen to all sides of the cash Isa argument, not just to the loud voices of a group of self-interested big businesses.\u201d However, the investment platform AJ Bell says a glance at the long-term performance of different markets \u201cshows that cash is definitely not king\u201d. It published figures showing that \u00a31,000 saved in a cash Isa in April 1999, when the accounts were launched, and earning the average cash Isa rate over that almost 26-year period, would have turned into \u00a32,016, assuming no further contributions. That\u2019s only a little bit better than inflation. But if that same \u00a31,000 had been invested in global equity funds, it would have on average grown to \u00a34,641. And if you had put it into a fund specialising in North American companies, you would typically be looking at \u00a35,964. Laura Suter, at AJ Bell, says: \u201cWhen it comes to choosing between a cash Isa and a stocks and shares Isa, the key question is: are you saving for the short term or the long term? If you\u2019re setting money aside for an emergency fund, typically three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses, then a cash Isa is a solid option \u2026 But if you\u2019re looking at medium-to-long-term goals, such as saving for retirement alongside a pension, for a house deposit, home improvements in future or a career break, then a stocks and shares Isa could be a more effective route.\u201d",

        "title": "Cash Isa providers fail to offer savers benefits of more flexible rules | Isas | The Guardian",
        "text": "While they offer attractive interest rates, many providers won\u2019t let savers open a second Isa account in the same tax year Savers hoping to make the most of their Isa allowance as the end of the tax year approaches may be surprised to find that some providers haven\u2019t adopted rule changes designed to make the tax-efficient accounts more flexible. With the future of cash Isas reportedly under discussion at the Treasury, this year\u2019s last-minute rush to invest before 5 April is under way, and providers are offering attractive interest rates to catch the eyes of savers. The current tax year is the first in which you can open more than one of the same kind of Isa \u2013 a change that was announced in 2023\u2019s autumn statement. Previously, your \u00a320,000-a-year Isa allowance could be spread between different types, including a cash Isa or stocks and shares Isa, but since April 2024, the tax authorities have let you have any combination. In theory this means that someone, for example, who has already during this tax year opened a fixed-rate cash Isa that they are no longer able to pay money into can now open another one with the same bank or building society and make the most of the best available rates that it is offering. It is one of several moves designed to simplify the system, but in practice many providers will not accept an application for a second cash Isa. Research from the financial data company Moneyfacts suggests that almost two-thirds of cash Isa providers do not allow customers to open a second account with them in the same tax year. This is the case at most of the UK\u2019s biggest banks, including Santander, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC, and at several building societies offering some of the best rates on the market. A saver attracted by the 4.22% two-year fixed cash Isa rate on offer this week at Coventry building society, for example, will find in the terms and conditions this rule: \u201cYou must not have paid in current tax year subscriptions to another cash Isa with us in the same tax year.\u201d Anna Bowes, a savings expert at the financial advisory firm The Private Office, says that while the rules on what you can do have changed, providers have not been obliged to adopt them. When she looked at what was available, \u201cwhat I found was that most providers would let you open an Isa with them if you had one with someone else, but most would not let you open a new one with them\u201d. She says that some providers were already offering what was called a flexible Isa, which allowed a similar thing ahead of the change. Nationwide building society is one of the best-known providers to offer this kind of cash Isa to savers. It describes it as a \u201cportfolio cash Isa\u201d, in which you can hold different types of accounts opened at different times. A spokesperson says: \u201cThis means [a saver] could put some in, say, a fixed-rate Isa and leave some in an easy access Isa, or have two fixed-rate Isas with different terms, etc.\u201d At the time of writing, Nationwide was offering a one-year, fixed-rate Isa at 4.1%, and a two-year one paying 4%, plus a one-year triple access online Isa that you can make up to three withdrawals a year from before the interest rate is cut from 4% to 1.75%. You can take advantage of these rates even if you already hold money with the society, and spread your savings money across all three types of account. The Moneyfacts research found that only 36 out of the 98 cash Isa providers it lists said they allowed multiple accounts in the same tax year. These include the online bank Zopa, which was offering a table-topping 5% on a one-year cash Isa at the start of the tax year, and this week appeared in the best-buy tables paying 4.4%. OakNorth Bank was offering a best-buy rate of 4.41% and will let you pay in even if you already have one of its cash Isas. Kent Reliance, M&S Bank and Skipton building society are among other providers that allow it. Several banks, including Santander, indicated that they could review their position in the future. However, if there is a question mark over the accounts in the future, there might not be an incentive for providers to make changes. Another rule change designed to make paying into an Isa easier was the scrapping of the requirement to sign a declaration before moving money into a previous year\u2019s account; but again, many providers have ignored this change. Yorkshire building society\u2019s website, for example, states that if you have a cash Isa from a previous tax year that you want to add to, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to complete an Isa declaration form. We can\u2019t add money to your account until we\u2019ve received this.\u201d The good news is that the process is pretty straightforward and, whoever your account is with, it should just involve filling in a form online or in a branch. Partial transfers on money saved or invested this year were also introduced, with the government website now stating: \u201cYou can transfer all or part of the savings in your individual savings account (Isa) from one provider to another at any time \u2026 The investment can have been made this year or in previous years.\u201d However, banks and building societies are typically refusing to take partial transfers of money invested in this tax year, and insisting that if you do want to switch, you have to move the whole lot. A spokesperson for the Treasury says: \u201cIt is a commercial decision for individual Isa providers whether they take advantage of increased flexibility in the Isa system, and customers should compare the terms offered by providers to find a product that suits their needs.\u201d",

        "text": "International Airlines Group says results reflect turnaround investment in BA as passenger numbers rebound Booming transatlantic ticket sales have lifted British Airways and its parent group to ever higher annual profits. International Airlines Group, led by BA, announced post-tax profits edging up to \u20ac2.73bn (\u00a32.26bn) for 2024, with operating profits up by 22% on the previous bumper year to \u20ac4.3bn (\u00a33.55bn), as passenger numbers continued to rebound from the Covid-era collapse. The bulk of the operating profit was driven by the British flag-carrier for the Spain-based group that also contains Iberia, Vueling and Level, as well as Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus. The performance was seen as vindication of measures including a \u00a37bn \u201cturnaround\u201d investment in BA, including new lounges and better technology to counter a faltering reputation for service and repeated IT-related failures. The chief executive of IAG, Luis Gallego, claimed the results reflected \u201cthe successful execution of our transformation programme\u201d. IAG also grew its capacity by 6% overall last year, including on the lucrative transatlantic market, with BA now the market leader on London-US routes and Iberia increasing its share of the Latin American market from Europe. Gallego said: \u201cWe are focused on continuing to make our brands the first choice for customers, by growing our network and enhancing the customer proposition, while our disciplined capital allocation ensures we can continue to invest in the business, deliver strong financial results and create sustainable value for our shareholders.\u201d In a sign of IAG\u2019s flushed financial success, he announced it would be paying a final dividend, taking the total dividend for the year to \u20ac435m (\u00a3359m), as well as embarking on a \u20ac1bn share buy-back scheme. Shares rose about 4% on Friday afternoon, taking the price near a five-year high and more than double where IAG shares were trading a year ago. Premium travel on the transatlantic routes remains a cash cow for BA, which contributed \u00a32bn to IAG\u2019s coffers, up from \u00a31.3bn in 2023. Sean Doyle, the BA chair, said capacity on the routes had \u201cmatured\u201d, with available seats only likely to rise by 1%. \u201cBut we do see demand remains robust. And we also saw a very strong recovery in business travel onboard in the transatlantic in the second half of the year,\u201d he said. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion IAG\u2019s results announcement still shows it does not believe business travel will return to pre-pandemic levels, particularly for short trips. However, affluent tourists are boosting its margins, and Doyle said BA was devoting ever more space to premium economy, with 15% more seats in the mid-range cabin than in 2019. While analyst consensus is that IAG\u2019s price will climb higher, some warned of the risks ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, a business recovery consultancy, said: \u201cDespite current successes, IAG must remain wary of the potential headwinds of a volatile geopolitical climate, the possible impact of tariffs and a highly competitive travel market. There is some careful navigation to be done to capitalise on success and avoid unwanted turbulence in 2025.\u201d The group\u2019s airlines carried 122 million passengers in 2024, up by 5.6%; 46 million of them were travelling on BA services.\n  Doyle said Gatwick\u2019s second runway, which gained backing but not planning ratification from the UK government on Thursday, was likely to see BA build up its presence again at London\u2019s second airport. But he ruled out restoring its operations there to pre-pandemic levels, after switching BA\u2019s focus almost entirely to Heathrow in the crisis in 2020. He said: \u201cI think strategies tried before haven\u2019t necessarily worked, but we have a big presence \u2013 both BA and IAG \u2013 at Gatwick, and have been growing our businesses there for the last three years. So we would evaluate the opportunity to grow when the capacity came on \u2013 but it wouldn\u2019t be in the form of a second hub.\u201d",

        "text": "Thousands of Lloyds, Nationwide, Halifax, TSB, Bank of Scotland and First Direct customers affected on Friday Thousands of UK bank customers were struggling to access their accounts on Friday, prompting concerns among MPs as lenders continue to close branches in a wider push towards digital banking. The IT failures meant customers of TSB, Nationwide, First Direct and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 including its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands \u2013 were struggling to log into online bank accounts or suffering from payment delays. The issues were worsened for customers who were ready for payday, often scheduled on the last day of the month. Most services were restored by Friday afternoon. It is the second month in a row that users have had to grapple with delays on crucial days for payments. At the end of January, an IT glitch left some Barclays customers locked out of their accounts for almost 24 hours on what was also HMRC\u2019s deadline day for settling self-assessment tax returns. MPs on the influential Treasury committee have demanded answers from banks and wrote to the chief executives of lenders including Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, Nationwide, Barclays and HSBC in early February. Executives were ordered to give details of the outages, how they affected customers, how their board responded, and how they planned to prevent future problems. The committee was due to publish lenders\u2019 responses in the coming days. However, Friday\u2019s outages are understood to have raised further concerns among MPs. The Treasury committee is assessing its options and will consider next steps next week, a person close to the committee said. The outages come amid a wider push towards digital banking by lenders who are facing growing competition from online-only lenders such as Monzo, Revolut and JP Morgan\u2019s Chase. Lenders who once dominated the high street have continued shutting branches, in a move they say is justified by dwindling use of in-person banking. It has led to thousands of closures, with the number of branches across the UK falling from roughly 10,565 in 2014 to 6,870 by 2024, according to British Banking Association and Office for National Statistics data. But repeated IT failures have highlighted the importance of providing face-to-face and manual banking services, ensuring that neither lenders nor their customers are held hostage by tech glitches, IT meltdowns or cyber-attacks. The regulator has tried to curb the prospect of banking deserts. As of last year, the Financial Conduct Authority requires banks to hold off from closing their sites until they can guarantee access to cash will not be affected. But that has resulted in banks pushing customers towards alternatives, including banking hubs or Post Offices that offer cash services. Commenting on the latest outages, UK Finance defended its members, who it said worked hard to fix any IT problems affecting customers. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion \u201cAll banks invest heavily in their systems and technology to ensure customers have easy access to banking services,\u201d the banking industry lobby group said. \u201cWhere issues arise, they work extremely hard to rectify them quickly and to support their customers. Banks have been posting information on their websites and social media accounts to ensure they keep customers updated.\u201d But Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at the consumer group Which?, said users should keep track of how the outages affected them, in case they could claim compensation. \u201cThese latest IT issues could cause real headaches for thousands of customers \u2013 made worse because it\u2019s payday for many of them. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that all affected banks keep customers updated and move quickly to compensate for any losses that may result from today\u2019s outages. Customers should keep evidence of impacted payments should they need to make a claim. If customers have missed important payments, they should contact the relevant company to ensure they waive any fees incurred.\u201d",

His fortune is valued at $343bn, according to Bloomberg\u2019s billionaires index. The total stock of global wealth was estimated at about $450tn by UBS last year. The total wealth of the UK was estimated at $16tn in 2022. A Citi spokesperson said: \u201cDespite the fact that a payment of this size could not actually have been executed, our detective controls promptly identified the inputting error between two Citi ledger accounts and we reversed the entry. Our preventative controls would have also stopped any funds leaving the bank. \u201cWhile there was no impact to the bank or our client, the episode underscores our continued efforts to continue eliminating manual processes and automating controls through our transformation.\u201d It was not the first fat finger error for Citi, which has previously faced criticisms of its internal systems. In 2020 it accidentally sent $900m to creditors of the cosmetics company Revlon. It took two years of legal battles for the bank to recover much of the money from several hedge funds, and the saga contributed to the departure of the Citigroup chief executive, Michael Corbat.

        "text": "Participants commit to not spending money for 24 hours to resist Trump administration and Musk\u2019s cuts On Friday, Americans across the country are participating in an economic boycott for 24 hours. Organized by the People\u2019s Union USA, a nonpartisan, grassroots organization, the boycott quickly picked up steam across social media, with thousands of users sharing posts with related hashtags. Participants are asked not to spend any money, and if they need to, it is recommended that they shop at a local, small business and pay in cash. \u201cFebruary 28 is a symbolic start to economic resistance, a day where we show corporations and politicians that we control the economy,\u201d reads the organization\u2019s website. \u201cThe date itself is not tied to any historical event, it is the beginning of something bigger.\u201d Spurred by anger about companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, in response to large-scale government cuts by Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge), some consumers are attempting to show their discontent with their wallets. Hundreds of people from across the country responded to a Guardian questionnaire in which they detailed their decisions to stop shopping at stores like Target or Walmart and to stop using companies like Amazon, Meta and X (formerly Twitter), even if it is inconvenient. Eric Butcher, a support group leader for the Alpha-1 Foundation, an organization that supports and provides resources for people with Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, said that he decided to participate in the boycott because it is \u201cthe only way that we can make folks understand that their decisions are affecting everyone. \u201cThese billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos \u2013 they have an unprecedented amount of access to the government, to the president, to the congressional members,\u201d said Butcher, who is from Bakersfield, California. \u201cAll the dark and powerful money has always been in our politics, but now it\u2019s unprecedented. It\u2019s so public and in your face. The only thing that they understand is money. So we have to hit them where it hurts.\u201d Butcher participated in the campaign because it was Rare Disease Day, he said, and has both Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Addison\u2019s disease. \u201cWith all the cuts to federal funding for healthcare, NIH, CDC, the impending cuts for Medicaid, Ssnap, the suggested cuts for social security, Medicare \u2013 this is gonna kill people. It\u2019s gonna kill people that are my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could kill me.\u201d Lisa Rayner, a small business owner in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said that participating in the boycott was \u201cno decision\u201d. She receives social security disability income, and said that she was \u201chorrified about what Elon Musk and Trump are doing together to destroy the US government\u201d. The economic boycott is not Rayner\u2019s first time using her wallet to show her values. \u201cI\u2019ve always participated in economic boycotts, like Buy Nothing Day, which goes back more than 25 years,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I am disabled and I shop at Amazon for some items, I made a decision last year after the election to stock up on a few essential items that I really needed and to spend as little as possible to do so. I\u2019ve already cut down on expenses.\u201d Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Rayner said that her 82-year-old mother was also participating in the economic boycott. They see participation as a way to show that people can come together and organize in solidarity. \u201c[I hope] people learn that they can live without these big corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it gives them time to reflect on how to live their lives differently as citizens rather than consumers and to feel like, yes, we can do it. We can cooperate, and we can beat them.\u201d Friday\u2019s boycott is occurring simultaneously with other economic protests: We Are Somebody, a labor advocacy group, launched a boycott of Target that started on 1 February, to coincide with Black History Month, in response to Target\u2019s decision to roll back DEI initiatives. Starting on 5 March, the first day of Lent, some Black faith leaders are calling on Christians to participate in a 40-day boycott of the company. The Latino Freeze movement, a nonpartisan grassroots effort that supports immigrant and Latino communities, keeps a targeted boycott list and is also asking people to stop spending at certain companies \u201cuntil they show us they care about our minority and immigrant populations of the United States\u201d.",

        "title": "Trump can\u2019t fulfil his promise to fix the economy, so he\u2019s blaming workers instead | Malaika Jabali | The Guardian",
        "text": "Forget about inflation. Now it\u2019s all about cutting \u2018waste\u2019 in the form of jobs and our already paltry social safety net During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump never missed an opportunity to harp on inflation, promising that \u201con day one\u201d he would \u201cend inflation\u201d and lower the costs of groceries, cars and other common goods. Well, it\u2019s day 40, and inflation saw its largest increase in over a year. Blink and you might have missed that Trump and his fellow Republicans have largely abandoned their concerns about inflation to focus on government \u201cwaste\u201d. While Trump hasn\u2019t fulfilled his campaign promise, he is living up to his usual brand of politics: the blame game. And this blame, as usual, is rooted in generating anger against \u201cundeserving\u201d Americans. This time, the undeserving are federal workers and poor people who get nominal benefits from the federal government \u2013 like Snap, which administers food stamps, and Medicaid. To fix so-called waste, the president apparently has no choice but to crack down on spending (and enlist help from Elon Musk), an issue that barely registered in the public consciousness in the past 10 years but is somehow now a rampant problem, according to Trump. There are policy frameworks backing Trump and the GOP\u2019s divisiveness, including the well-known Project 2025 and a lesser-known House proposal published in 2024, Fiscal Sanity to Save America, that centers government \u201cwaste\u201d instead of corporate greed. And now, with Republicans controlling the House, Senate and presidency, Republicans have the power to act on cuts that will harm millions of Americans. Musk and Trump, of course, have already worked to cut thousands of federal workers\u2019 jobs. And with the Trump-backed budget bill the House passed on Wednesday, including $800bn in likely cuts from Medicaid, Republicans are one step closer to bulldozing America\u2019s already paltry social safety net. This isn\u2019t just at the federal level. Republicans have been floating proposals in state governments that would restrict healthcare, housing and food benefits instead of making it easier to afford things. The party of \u201cfreedom\u201d is endorsing government home visits to surveil \u201cfraud\u201d in all US states (according to page 43 of the GOP\u2019s \u201cFiscal Sanity\u201d plan). The party of \u201cfamily values\u201d is also turning its attention to school lunch and breakfast programs, which it claims are subject to \u201cwidespread\u201d fraud and abuse (page 46). The party that wants to \u201cmake America healthy again\u201d is floating restrictions to Medicaid that would make recipients work at least 80 hours a month, a proposal that wastes government time and money to verify work requirements and which would probably just deter people from getting healthcare, as a flailing GOP work requirement experiment in Georgia has shown. And as Trump touts himself as an anti-war president, his proposals belie the fact that much of these spending cuts will now be diverted to defense contracts and other military and border spending, not on improving the economic lives of everyday workers to whom he made sweeping campaign promises. Meanwhile, straightforward proposals to simply give people more money (which does have evidence of working), such as universal basic income, would be outright banned at the federal level under the GOP plan. So as the cost of living is primed to increase, Republicans have ready-made excuses to justify cutting billions of dollars from these programs, an exceptional sort of cruelty. Of course, no one wants to see public money being spent wastefully or fraudulently. But incessant focus on \u201cwaste\u201d stems from faulty, selective evidence. According to reports from Musk\u2019s own so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d, nearly 40% of cancelled contracts to cut costs are expected to yield no savings. It also stems from something else that does have proven results: the utility of public outrage. Focusing on extreme examples and \u201cundeserving\u201d government beneficiaries animates America\u2019s existing propensity for divisiveness, giving Trump and his party wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions of people who don\u2019t engage in fraud, waste or abuse. When Reagan wanted tax cuts for the rich, we saw the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d trope. When neoliberal Democrats and Republicans wanted to cut public housing at the federal and local level, we saw extreme stories about the criminality of people who lived there. We cannot waste the money of hard-working Americans on these \u201cothers\u201d. It\u2019s a narrative \u2013 often hinging on racism and sexism \u2013 that has great outcomes for America\u2019s capitalist class and the politicians who support them. So instead of protesting against the rising cost of living or making demands for universal healthcare, federal job guarantees, increased labor rights, or Snap benefits for all, or cutting the bloated defense budget and increasing taxes on the super-rich to pay for the nominal social welfare benefits that other industrial countries have normalized, working-class Americans are engaging in petty debates about what kinds of groceries other working-class Americans should buy and deputizing themselves to root out \u201cabuse\u201d among other workers. Republicans redirecting blame towards people who are suffering in this economy under the guise of \u201cwaste\u201d is a distraction. As inflation is poised to worsen under Trump, Americans would be wise to focus their anger more on the elected officials and billionaires who profit from their pain than on each other.

        "title": "What would a UK-US economic deal really look like? | International trade | The Guardian",
        "text": "London and Washington aim to avoid obstacles and forge a narrower agreement, likely with a focus on tech and AI When Boris Johnson flew to meet Donald Trump for the first time at the Biarritz G7 summit in 2019, he boasted en route to reporters about the huge benefits a post-Brexit trade deal with the US would bring\u00a0\u2013 citing a baffling range of great British products, from pork pies to shower trays. Despite the positive chemistry between the two blond blowhards, and the launch of formal talks the following year, no agreement was ever reached. What the US and UK now appear to be aiming at, after Keir Starmer\u2019s trip to Washington, is not a broad-based free trade agreement like that contemplated (unrealistically) by Johnson, and covering a range of sectors \u2013 but something much more limited. The suggestion from No 10 has been that the two sides will draw up a narrower, economic deal, focusing on cooperation in technology. That is for good reason: even before Trump appeared on the scene, there was little enthusiasm in the US for deepening trade cooperation with other countries. The last new US free trade agreement that came into force was with Colombia, in 2011 \u2013 aside from the USMCA, a reworking of the Nafta deal with Canada and Mexico, which Trump signed in 2020 and is now busy smashing up. When it comes to the UK specifically, any broad-based deal would be likely to bring into play two issues that are highly problematic politically. These are: agriculture, where the US has different approaches that the UK is unlikely to want to accept \u2013 such as washing chickens in chlorine; and the NHS, widely viewed as a huge prize for the US life sciences sector. Washington\u2019s published negotiating aims for the last attempt at a post-Brexit trade deal, in 2019, included achieving \u201ccomprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK\u201d. Labour\u2019s stated aim of striking up a closer post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU creates an added barrier to this kind of deal, because accepting US food standards, for example, would scupper any veterinary agreement with Brussels. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the NHS would not be \u201con the table\u201d in any potential negotiations; though he did point to the value of sharing data, in exchange for UK patients benefiting from new treatments \u2013 an argument that may alarm privacy campaigners. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of selling off people\u2019s data, but in terms of data access, absolutely the thing that the NHS can offer and the thing that the NHS can get in return is being a really strong partner for clinical trials,\u201d he told the BBC. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion John Springford, of the Centre for European Reform, suggested a narrow, tech-focused deal could include the UK promising to adopt a similar approach to artificial intelligence regulation, for example \u2013 where the US has strongly criticised the EU\u2019s more stringent legislation. \u201cThat could be preferable to getting into the weeds of a free trade agreement,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s refusal, alongside the US, to sign up to a declaration on \u201cinclusive and sustainable\u201d AI at the recent Paris summit may have been an early signal of the two countries thinking along similar lines. Given the UK\u2019s determination to increase defence spending rapidly, there could also be some promise of collaboration on arms procurement (although Trump did momentarily fail to recognise Aukus, the acronym for the Australia-UK-US security alliance). Ultimately, the main aim of any deal will not be to carve out new markets for UK exporters, whether of pork pies, shower trays or anything else \u2013 but to dodge the tariffs this second Trump administration is using to reshape the global trading system. That is a very different proposition to the broad-based agreement Brexit\u2019s most fervent fans once contemplated, drawing the UK closer to the US economy and away from the EU. But given what Trump is preparing to visit on many other countries, it could be a big win.",

        "title": "Labour\u2019s aid cuts are morally wrong. Here\u2019s why they make no economic sense either | Larry Elliott | The Guardian",
        "text": "Aid was soft power but also good for business: as countries get richer, they buy exports. Strategically, this is very short-sighted Get right down to it and there are two reasons for thinking that cuts to Britain\u2019s aid budget to pay for defence are a seriously bad idea. The first is that people will die as a result. There will be less money to respond to humanitarian crises and less money for vaccination programmes and hospitals. Realpolitik is being blamed for the decision, but realpolitik doesn\u2019t make it right. But there are also economic arguments for rich countries providing financial support to less well-off nations, which were summed up succinctly in last year\u2019s Labour party manifesto. This document could not have been clearer. International assistance, it said, helps make \u201cthe world a safer, more prosperous place\u201d. That remains as true as it was when Labour came to power last summer, and indeed it was still the party\u2019s stated belief a month ago. When, as one of his first decisions, Donald Trump gutted the US aid budget, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it could be a \u201cbig strategic mistake\u201d. Now that the UK has followed suit and reduced aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of national output, Lammy says it was a difficult but pragmatic decision. He was right before and is wrong now. At its crudest, the economic case for overseas aid is that it is good for business. As countries become richer, they provide export opportunities for donor countries. The US has always understood this, with postwar Marshall aid for European reconstruction in part driven by fear of the spread of communism and in part as a means to provide markets for US goods. Under previous administrations, US humanitarian aid programmes have channelled agricultural surpluses into overseas food programmes. In today\u2019s world, it is no longer possible to think of aid spending and defence spending as discrete pots of money. Extreme poverty is increasingly concentrated in those parts of the world most seriously damaged by wars and the climate crisis. Five years ago, the global economy was about to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a shock from which the UK has yet to recover. Ministers need to ask themselves a simple question: does cutting the aid budget make another worldwide health emergency more or less likely? Poor countries need help to boost economic development more than ever. They havebeen hard hit by the double whammy of Covid and the higher food prices triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine three years ago. A new debt crisis is looming, and both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have been warning that money that could and should be spent on schools, hospitals and building protection against the effects of the climate emergency is instead being spent paying back creditors. The Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown spearheaded previous debt relief efforts and were able to do so because Britain showed a strong commitment to overseas assistance. A new Department for International Development was set up, a goal was set of meeting the UN aid target of 0.7% of national income, and there was a clear gameplan. Spending more on aid was good for poor countries, but it was also good for rich countries such as Britain. It was a classic example of the exercise of soft power. Britain punched well above its weight when development issues were discussed at the IMF and World Bank. The world is a lot more fragile and divided than it was in the early years of this century, when growth was strong and the era of financial crises and global pandemics was still in the future. With the US and China locked in a battle for economic supremacy, the battle is on to capture hearts and minds. Seen in this context, the UK\u2019s decision to follow the US lead on aid spending is shortsighted. It will merely make poor countries more susceptible to offers of assistance from Beijing. None of which is to say that every penny of aid is well spent. Yes, there is waste, as there is with defence spending. But in making the choice it has, the government has effectively bought into the rightwing argument that aid does more harm than good and traps poor people into a dependency culture. Labour needs to be careful. The right says the same about the welfare state, which will be next on its list of targets. There is a case for higher defence spending. It is a more dangerous world and Britain can no longer rely on the US to provide guaranteed military support. But let\u2019s be clear. The reason the aid budget is being cut to pay for the armed forces is not because it is the best way to raise money but because it is the easiest. The government is calculating that it will get far less grief from voters \u2013 especially Labour voters flirting with Reform UK \u2013 this way. There are alternatives. Rachel Reeves could increase taxes on the wealthy. If the need is really as urgent as the government says, then the chancellor could justify borrowing more. A truly progressive government would be reviving the idea of a Robin Hood tax on speculative financial transactions to meet its manifesto pledge of raising aid spending back to 0.7% of national income. Instead, Starmer has done the reverse of a Robin Hood tax. Shamefully, he is balancing the books courtesy of the poorest people in the world. This will not make the world a safer and more prosperous place. The exact opposite, in fact. Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist",

Learn More Key Points There are countless ways to start collecting passive income. One great option is to invest in EPR Properties (EPR 2.38%). The real estate investment trust (REIT) pays a monthly dividend that currently yields 6.5%. At that rate, a $1,000 investment would generate about $65 of dividend income each year. That passive income stream should rise in the future as the REIT grows its portfolio and increases its monthly dividend. It recently gave investors a 3.5% raise. With more portfolio growth in the forecast, EPR Properties should be able to continue producing a rising stream of passive income. EPR Properties is a specialty REIT focused on experiential real estate. It owns a diversified portfolio of movie theaters, eat & play properties, attractions, fitness and wellness properties, and other experiences leased to tenants that operate the properties. The REIT also has a small portfolio of educational properties. Those leases provide it with relatively steady rental income that it uses to pay its monthly dividend. Last year, EPR Properties generated $4.87 per share of funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted. It paid out a total of $3.40 per share in dividends. That gave it a dividend payout ratio of around 70%. The REIT used the cash it retained (about $110 million) to help fund new investments in experiential properties. Overall, it invested $264 million last year, with the balance covered by asset sales (it sold $74.4 million of non-core theater and educational properties for a net gain of $16.1 million) and its balance sheet capacity. It's investing in several development and redevelopment projects, including building new Andretti Karting locations and an extensive expansion of The Springs Resort. It also invested in mortgage financing for Iron Mountain Hot Springs and acquired Enchanted Forest Water Safari in a sale-leaseback transaction. Those new investments will grow the REIT's sources of stable income. They also align with its strategy of reducing its exposure to theater and educational properties while growing its rental income from other experiential property types. EPR Properties expects to generate between $4.94 and $5.14 per share of FFO as adjusted this year. That's a 3.5% increase at the midpoint from last year's level, driven by rising rents across its existing portfolio and new investments made last year. That outlook for growing rental income gave the REIT the confidence to increase its dividend by another 3.5% for this year, pushing the payment to $0.295 per share each month ($3.54 annualized). The REIT expects to invest another $200 million to $300 million into new experiential real estate this year. It has already lined up $150 million of development and redevelopment projects that it anticipates funding over the next two years. The remaining will come from additional property acquisitions, mortgage investments, and new development/redevelopment projects. EPR Properties can fund that investment level internally via post-dividend free cash flow, additional asset sales, and its balance sheet. The REIT currently plans to sell between $25 million and $75 million of non-core assets. It has already agreed to sell four more theater properties. In addition, it is looking to unwind several underperforming joint ventures that hold experiential lodging properties. The REIT is currently capping its investment volume to a level it can internally fund until its cost of capital improves. However, with interest rates starting to fall and the REIT's stock price on the rise (it's up nearly 20% this year), its cost of capital is getting better. That could enable EPR Properties to ramp up its investment volume by selling stock and issuing new debt to fund additional deals, which could support higher FFO and dividend growth rates in the future. EPR Properties provides investors with a lucrative stream of passive income backed by a high-quality portfolio of experiential properties. The REIT has enough funding from internal sources to grow its portfolio, cash flow, and dividend at a decent rate. Meanwhile, with market conditions improving, it could start ramping up its investment volume to grow even faster. Because of that, it's an exciting stock to buy for income and upside potential.

Learn More Key Points Investors interested in Realty Income (O 0.81%) typically are attracted to its monthly dividend payment, consistently growing dividend, and robust yield. While the real estate investment trust (REIT) continues to deliver on those fronts, its stock price performance has been lackluster over the past several years. In fact, its stock price is down more than 30% over the past five years, as of this writing. The stock was slipping once again after the REIT reported its fourth-quarter results and issued disappointing guidance. Let's take a look at its most recent quarterly report, the safety of its dividend, and when investors can expect the stock to potentially rebound. Realty Income has generally turned in pretty consistent results over the past few years. The biggest reason behind the stock's decline hasn't been its operational performance, which has been solid, but instead its share price declines have reflected increasing capitalization rates (cap rates), which have led to decreases in the value of its commercial properties. Cap rates often follow interest rates, and as interest rates spiked a few years ago so did cap rates. Meanwhile, Realty Income is facing more scrutiny around its customer base. Three of the company's top-four tenants -- Dollar General, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Dollar Tree -- have been struggling. Dollar stores have been facing difficult conditions due to the struggles of their lower-income customer bases, inflation, and competition from Walmart. Walgreens has been dealing with drug reimbursement pressures and lower front-end store sales. As a result, it has begun closing unprofitable stores. Combined, these three tenants account for nearly 10% of Realty Income's contracted rent. Turning to the REIT's Q4 results, its revenue climbed 24% to $1.34 billion, helped by its January 2024 acquisition of Spirit Realty and new property investments. Same-store rental revenue increased 0.8% in the quarter, while its occupancy rate was 98.7%, the same as last quarter and up slightly from a year ago. Industrial properties once again were a bright spot, with 2% same-store rental growth in the quarter. Casino properties same-store rental revenue rose 1.7%, while retail was up 0.5% and other properties, which include data centers, was up 0.7%. Motor vehicle dealerships were one of the worst-performing categories in the quarter, down 10.1%, while casual restaurants fell 4%. Realty Income was aggressive in the quarter deploying capital, making $1.72 billion in investments. This included $1.3 billion in real estate, with $988.6 million of that deployed in the U.S. The REIT invested $149.4 million in new properties under development. It also sold 80 properties for $138.1 million in proceeds during the quarter. The company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share increased 4% to $1.05. AFFO measures the amount of cash flow a REIT can generate from its operations. Realty Income prefers this metric because different depreciation assumptions do not impact it and thus it is a more standardized metric across the REIT industry. Realty Income forecast AFFO per share of $4.22 to $4.28, with same-store rental growth of 1%. It expects occupancy to be more than 98%. Meanwhile, it is looking to deploy $4 billion in investment during the year. Analysts, however, were looking for AFFO of $4.32 for the year. The company said its guidance takes into consideration potential tenant credit issues and that just under 5% of its portfolio is on its credit watch list. However, it noted that being on this list does not mean a credit event will occur, and it recently took a tenant off the list. Image source: Getty Images. In February, Realty Income raised its monthly dividend by 1.5% month over month, or 4.5% year over year, to $0.268. That equals $3.216 on a yearly basis, good for a forward yield of 5.7%. The company is currently on pace for its 110th straight quarterly dividend increase in Q1. Realty Income's dividend remains well covered by its AFFO, which is one of the best measures to determine its safety. Its AFFO payout ratio for the year was 74.6%, demonstrating a solid dividend coverage ratio. Interestingly, the company approved a $2 billion stock buyback program in February. Realty Income tends to sell stock through an at-the-market (ATM) program in order to fund its real estate investments, including raising $1.8 billion last year through ATM sales. The REIT has not bought back any shares in the past five years. The buyback authorization could be an indication that management thinks one of the best investments it can make is now in its own stock. Realty Income currently trades around its lowest price-to-tangible-book-value ratio, which is the valuation of the properties minus its liabilities. O Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts Realty Income's valuation could reflect some caution regarding its dollar store and pharmacy tenants, but thus far the company has not seen any big occupancy or same-store rental pressure. Meanwhile, with the Federal Reserve more in a cycle of cutting interest rates rather than raising them, cap rates and the value of its properties should at the very least remain steady. With guidance looking conservative and a historically cheap stock price, Realty Income's stock could finally be set up to outperform after years of underperformance. While the economy could be a risk, Realty Income is still skewed more toward tenants that sell non-discretionary items and the lower interest rates that would accompany any economic weakness could help with cap rates and the value of its properties. As such, I think investors can accumulate the stock at current levels. Geoffrey Seiler has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Key Points Nvidia (NVDA 3.97%) has proven itself to be a solid long-term investment, with its stock soaring 1,800% over the past five years. This is thanks to the company's dominance in one of today's highest-growth areas: artificial intelligence (AI). From about $200 billion right now, this market is forecast to reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade. And Nvidia, due to its leadership, already is reaping the rewards. The company has reported quarter after quarter of double- and triple-digit earnings growth, and in the most recent period, the momentum continued. Nvidia delivered quarterly and full-year revenue increases to record levels -- $39 billion in the quarter and $130 billion for the year. In even better news, an enormous amount of growth may be ahead as the company is set to benefit from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout as well as the next phases of AI growth -- such as the extended application of the technology to real-world problems. So, you probably won't be surprised when I say Nvidia is a fantastic stock to own. But when exactly should you get in on this player? You could make the move right away, or you could wait until March 18, a day that may represent a big catalyst for the stock. Image source: Getty Images. First, let's take a look at why Nvidia could make a great addition to your portfolio. Nvidia has established a solid earnings track record, and this growth should continue thanks to the company's leadership and innovation in AI. Nvidia makes the world's fastest AI chips -- known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- and sells a wide selection of other related products and services. Basically, new or seasoned AI customers can find just about everything they need at Nvidia. Innovation is a particularly important point because it's the element that may keep Nvidia ahead of rivals in this fast-paced market. In Nvidia's recent earnings call, it spoke about the successful rollout of its new Blackwell architecture -- a product that brought in $11 billion in its first full quarter on the market. And Nvidia said it's on track to keep its promise of innovation on an annual basis, with Blackwell Ultra set for launch in the second half of the year, and then the Rubin architecture to follow. All of this means Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout and the next stages of AI growth. And this makes the stock a no-brainer buy for any investor aiming to bet on the AI revolution. But some investors might be thinking it's wise to wait a couple of weeks. On March 18, we may learn even more about Nvidia's role in the development of AI as CEO Jensen Huang will be delivering the keynote at the company's annual GTC AI conference. \"Come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that,\" Huang said during Nvidia's earnings call this week, suggesting the event may bring exciting details about what's next for the company. GTC will unfold over five days and feature exhibits, panels, and even a quantum computing day -- a first for the event. Huang's keynote address is scheduled from 10 a.m. to noon PT on March 18. Recent history shows us that Nvidia's stock hasn't necessarily soared in the weeks following its earnings reports -- even though these reports have been strong. For example, in the month following the last two earnings reports, the stock declined. If Nvidia stagnates or falls over the coming days, you may buy the stock at a lower price just ahead of GTC or as it kicks off than if you rush to get in on it now. Of course, history isn't always right, and that means Nvidia also could soar in the coming days, meaning you could end up paying more for the stock if you wait. So, what's the best decision? It's important to take the pressure off yourself and remember that short-term performance won't impact your overall performance if you hold onto a stock for the long term. Earlier, I mentioned Nvidia's quadruple-digit gain over the past five years -- an increase or decrease over any given few weeks during that time wouldn't have changed an investor's returns at the end of the period by very much. All of this means it doesn't really matter whether you buy shares of Nvidia today, right before Huang's keynote on March 18, or even after the conference. Over the long term, you're likely to see the same result, and in this case, that result could be very positive. That said, Nvidia looks particularly cheap as I write this, trading at about 29 times forward earnings estimates, so if you have the cash available to invest, now is a great moment to get in on this top AI stock.

Learn More Key Points SoFi Technologies (SOFI 2.84%) stock has ping-ponged back and forth during its short time as a public company, but it made a major leap and is up 66% in the past 12 months. It's still 47% off of its all-time high and trading for less than $15. But is it ever going to get back there? Let's see if this is a huge opportunity or if investors should steer clear. Investors were enthusiastic about SoFi when it first came onto the scene because it's disrupting the huge, traditional banking industry. It's the prototypical fintech, offering standard financial products with updated technology on its all-digital banking app. It has consistently delivered strong growth, and it has reported positive and increasing net income for the past five consecutive quarters. Customers are drawn to its user-friendly interface that makes managing your money less intimidating, and it's catching on with its target market of young professionals who are starting their financial journeys. That gives it significant long-term potential as this population ages and becomes more affluent. Membership growth and product adoption have been outstanding. SoFi ended 2024 with 10.1 million members, a 34% year-over-year increase, and 14.7 million products, 32% more year over year. Revenue increased 26% year over year, and SoFi delivered $0.15 in earnings per share (EPS). SoFi stock has been less consistent. It's been up and down, mostly on updates about its lending business. That's because lending is still its core business, accounting for 51% of adjusted net revenue in the fourth quarter and most of the profits. But the lending industry is highly vulnerable to whipsawing interest rates. That's one reason management has waged a diversification campaign. Its other segments are financial services and tech platform, a white-label fintech infrastructure business. These expand its business and take some of the pressure off of lending. Financial services has been particularly strong, and together the non-lending segments have increased as a percentage of the business and have contributed higher revenue and profit. Data source: SoFi quarterly reports. All metrics are for the 2024 fourth quarter. Growth is year over year. Offering more financial services does more than just hedge against interest rate volatility. It feeds into what Sofi calls its financial services productivity loop, which is its strategy to cross-sell new products. That generates higher engagement and revenue. Young stocks come with tremendous growth potential, but they also bring risk. SoFi is doing an excellent job of becoming a more stable company, and it's evolving into\u00a0 a more classically defined banking business. It doesn't have the maturity of the more reliable big bank stocks, but it also has higher growth potential. It's important to consider valuation when assessing any stock, but valuation isn't in a vacuum; any glimpse in time needs to be considered in a broader context, like multiyear averages and industry standards. SoFi stock trades at a forward one-year P/E ratio of 30, which is high for a bank stock but reasonable for a growth stock. Banks are typically valued using the price-to-book ratio, and SoFi's is high at 2.4, but not much higher than JPMorgan Chase's 2.2. I won't claim SoFi is a bargain, but it doesn't seem astronomically priced, either. Looking down the road five or 10 years, I see SoFi continuing to grow and become a more reliable banking contender. It looks like a solid buy for the growth-oriented, long-term investor who has some appetite for risk. JPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

Learn More Key Points Tesla (TSLA 3.91%) continues to be a volatile business to own. Yes, the shares have soared 463% in the past five years. However, they are currently 30% off their peak price from December last year. There's no doubt that this is an iconic company that's aiming to shape the future of technology. And investors might view the current dip as too good of an opportunity. Should you buy this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock while it's trading below $350? Let's take a closer look at the bull and bear cases for Tesla. Tesla's biggest bull case rests on its success at innovating and disrupting the global car industry. Tesla deserves credit for making electric vehicles (EV) popular. Credit also goes to the build-out of the Supercharger network that added utility for consumers. Today, Tesla offers five EV models. And according to CarEdge, it has 44% EV market share in the U.S., putting it well ahead of second place General Motors domestically. And globally, Tesla is behind only BYD Company. Nonetheless, Tesla's rapid growth spurred EV investments from other auto makers. Another reason that investors might want to buy the stock is because of Tesla's greater ambition. Perhaps the company's ultimate goal is to one day launch a global fleet of robotaxis, which could see \"quasi-infinite\" demand. Ark Invest believes this could introduce a massive, multitrillion-dollar opportunity for Tesla. There's also the potential of the Optimus Robot. Tesla says it could start selling these to other businesses next year. Part of the allure of owning Tesla shares is being able to place a bet on founder and CEO Elon Musk. Despite what you might think about his recent push into the political arena, or the fact that he has what seems like a million different things all fighting for his time and attention, he is arguably the most visionary corporate executive of our time. Investors might appreciate his ability to spot new trends and position Tesla to take advantage of them. Tesla is a classic \"story stock.\" Investors are glued to every word Musk says, making the narrative drive the share price. This means that valuation can get far away from reality, as is the case today. Right now, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 166. Any reasonable analysis of the company would point to this being an insane valuation to pay. This becomes clear when viewing Tesla's business as it currently stands. In 2024, 77% of revenue was derived from EV sales. This automotive revenue figure declined 8% year over year, driven by the first-ever drop in unit deliveries. Obviously, this is not a good trend. Profitability is also taking a hit. Tesla's financial performance now resembles a traditional auto maker instead of some high-flying tech enterprise. Growth is slowing. Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, and more competition in the EV market are all negative factors working against Tesla. The valuation implies flawless execution on the part of Musk and Tesla. In fact, the P/E ratio is based on the belief of what Tesla could become one day, not what it is right now. But it's not a virtual certainty that a worldwide robotaxi service will be launched, for example. If history is any indication, we are still a long way from this technology not only being fully developed but from humans feeling comfortable and safe using it. There's still a ton of uncertainty. Tesla shares trade below $350, well off their record high. Investors might want to buy the dip. In my opinion, though, it's best to pass on the stock. There are some rosy expectations embedded in the valuation that make the downside significantly higher than the upside. Neil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Key Points S&P Global, American Express, and Nu are great long-term investments. Many financial stocks swooned in 2022 and 2023 as inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds shook the markets. But in 2024, some of those stocks stabilized with the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts. This year, the Fed is expected to cut its rates at least two more times. The financial sector could still face unpredictable challenges from tariffs and geopolitical tensions, but it could be smart to buy a few resilient winners today as long-term plays. Image source: Getty Images. So even if you only have $200 to invest right now, I think it's a good idea to nibble on these three resilient financial stocks through fractional trades: S&P Global (SPGI 1.59%), American Express (AXP 2.30%), and Nu Holdings (NU -4.44%). S&P Global provides financial data, credit rating, and analytics services for all the Fortune 100 companies and 80% of the Fortune 500 companies. Its platform is widely used by banks, insurance companies, corporations, universities, and institutional investors. It's also been integrating new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including its Spark Assist generative AI co-pilot, to accelerate those tasks. From 2019 to 2024, its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% as its EPS increased at a CAGR of 8%. It maintained that steady growth even though its profits dipped in 2022 and 2023. That two-year decline was mainly caused by rising interest rates, which temporarily throttled debt offerings and the growth of its credit ratings business, as well as the divestiture of its engineering solutions business in 2023. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect S&P Global's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 7% and 14%, respectively, as interest rates decline, the debt market stabilizes, and more organizations use its AI-powered analytics tools to make more efficient decisions. Its stock might not seem cheap at 38 times this year's earnings, but its evergreen business model, wide moat, and predictable growth rates justify its premium valuation. American Express controls a smaller slice of the card processing market than Visa and Mastercard. But unlike those two market leaders, which don't actually issue their own cards or take on any debt, American Express is a bank and card issuer that processes payments and backs its cards with its own balance sheet. That business model forces American Express to only issue its cards to higher-income and low-risk customers, which insulates it from economic downturns. It's also resistant to interest rate swings, since high interest rates boost its banking segment's net income as low interest rates drive its cardholders to make more purchases. From 2019 to 2024, American Express' revenue and EPS grew at a CAGR of 10% and 12%, respectively, even as the pandemic and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 8% and 12%, respectively. Its stock still looks like a bargain at 19 times this year's earnings, and it should continue growing at a steady rate for decades to come. Nu, which is based in Brazil and also operates in Mexico and Colombia, is the largest digital-only direct bank in Latin America. Its total number of customers more than tripled from 33.3 million at the end of 2021 to 114.2 million at the end of 2024. Its activity rate (active customers divided by total customers) rose from 76% in 2021 to 83% in 2024. From 2021 to 2024, Nu's revenue grew at a CAGR of 89%. It also turned profitable in 2023, and its net income nearly doubled in 2024. That rapid growth was driven by the expansion of its ecosystem, with more checking, credit card, lending, insurance, investment, cryptocurrency, and business-oriented services. It also tethered more merchants to its Nu Shopping e-commerce app, and it's been rolling out more AI tools to support its analytics tools, chatbots, and cybersecurity services. The World Bank estimates that over 70% of Latin America's population is still unbanked, so Nu still has plenty of room to grow. As a digital-only bank, it can expand much faster than its regional brick-and-mortar competitors. From 2024 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 29% and 38%, respectively. Those are stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at just 21 times this year's earnings.

Learn More Key Points In the fourth quarter, several prominent hedge fund managers sold Nvidia (NVDA 3.97%) and bought the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT 1.16%), an exchange-traded fund issued by BlackRock that tracks the price of Bitcoin. The three billionaires mentioned above manage the three most successful hedge funds in history in terms of net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. That makes them good sources of inspiration. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Nvidia reported excellent fourth-quarter financial results, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 78% to $39.3 billion on particularly strong growth in data center sales, and non-GAAP net income increased 71% to $0.89 per diluted share. The company also provided first-quarter guidance that exceeded estimates. However, the stock has fallen about 10% since the report. One cause for the decline may be the 3-percentage point contraction in gross margin in the fourth quarter, which suggests Nvidia has lost some pricing power. But Stifel analyst Ruben Roy thinks that number will rebound as Nvidia sells more of its next-generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). The investment thesis for Nvidia is solid. Its GPUs are the leading artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. And competing with the company is difficult due to its CUDA platform, software development tools that include 300 code libraries and 600 pretrained AI models. CUDA helps programmers write AI applications across disciplines ranging from healthcare and retail to autonomous robots and self-driving cars. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase 50% in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026. That makes the current valuation of 40 times adjusted earnings look downright cheap. So, why were certain hedge fund managers selling Nvidia in the fourth quarter? I suspect it was more about portfolio diversification than lost confidence in the company. Regardless, patient investors should consider buying a small position today. Bitcoin has advanced 35% over the past year to $84,000, but several Wall Street experts expect tremendous price appreciation in the coming years, as detailed below: Personally, I think those forecasts are very aggressive, but I do see three catalysts that could make Bitcoin more valuable in the coming years: adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the periodic halving of Bitcoin mining subsidies, and the possible creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Spot Bitcoin ETFs reduce friction by providing Bitcoin exposure without the hassle and high fees associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. Consequently, those funds are creating demand by drawing more investors to the market. The iShares Bitcoin ETF was the most successful ETF launch in history in terms of net inflows during its first year on the market, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bitcoin is created and awarded to miners that add new transaction blocks to the blockchain, which involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles. However the Bitcoin subsidies awarded to miners are cut in half every 210,000 blocks, which limits the supply of Bitcoin to 21 million coins. The economic law of supply and demand says any asset with a fixed supply will become more valuable as demand increases. President Donald Trump in January signed an executive order that tasked a working group with evaluating the creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile. If such a stockpile is created, it would likely position the government as a buyer of Bitcoin. That would increase demand for cryptocurrency and help push its price higher. Importantly, while the tailwinds discussed could make Bitcoin more valuable in the long run, history says it will be a very bumpy ride. Bitcoin has fallen 20% since mid-January, and it has dropped more than 50% from a record high three times in the last six years. Only investors comfortable with that type of volatility should consider buying a position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Trevor Jennewine has positions in Nvidia.

Learn More Key Points Shares of Block (XYZ 1.59%) were tumbling after the fintech company reported weaker-than-expected Q4 results that missed analyst expectations. The big drop now leaves the company down more than 20% on the year, as of this writing. Here's a closer look at Block's results to help determine if this is a good buying opportunity. Block operates two main businesses: Square and Cash App. The former, which was the company's original business, was developed as a way for merchants to accept card payments from their smartphones or tablets. The business has evolved, and now Square offers an entire software and hardware ecosystem to help retailers manage their businesses. Meanwhile, Cash App is best known as a peer-to-peer payment network. It also offers other services such as savings accounts, brokerage accounts, crypto services, debit cards, lending, and tax preparation. For the fourth quarter, Block's revenue rose nearly 5% to $6.03 billion, which was short of the $6.29 billion analysts were expecting, as compiled by LSEG. Square revenue climbed 9% to $1.97 billion, while Cash App revenue rose 3% to $4.02 billion. The company prefers to focus on gross profits instead of revenue, as its Bitcoin trading business can impact revenue. On that front, gross profits rose 14% to $2.31 billion. Square gross profits increased 12% to $924 million, while Cash App gross profits jumped 16% to $1.38 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS), meanwhile, surged 51% to $0.71, but fell well short of the $0.87 consensus. Square's gross payment volume (GPV), which is the dollar value of the transactions that get processed through its payment network, rose 10% in the quarter. U.S. GPV increased 7%, while international GPV soared 25%. The company said that the increases were due to strong retention and improving same-store-sales growth for the businesses using the Square platform. For Cash App, monthly transacting users grew 9% to 25 million, while gross profit per these monthly active users climbed 13% to $76. In addition, active users who deposit their paychecks through the app jumped 25% to 2.5 million users. Block said it spent 2024 overhauling Square's technology to transform it from a payments platform to a commerce platform, while also improving its onboarding process. It will now look to grow the business in 2025 through retention, adding customers, product enhancements, and increased marketing investments. It recently added a number of new features to its restaurant solution, including Bar Tabs, Scan-to-Pay, and Instant Payouts for market-delivery orders. For Cash App, Block said that in 2024, it expanded its financial services capabilities while making investments in compliance, customer support, and the customer experience. It added new features, such as high-yield savings, free in-network ATM withdrawals, overdraft coverage, and free tax filing. In 2025, the company is looking for the rollout of Afterpay on its Cash App and its Cash App Card to be a big growth driver. It also expects its Bitcoin mining chip system Proto to be a nice contributor in the second half of 2025. Overall, Block is looking to see a significant growth inflection point during 2025. Its goal is to finish the year with a \"Rule of 40\" run rate. (The Rule of 40 is generally when a company has revenue growth and profit margins that are 40% or above.) Block uses gross profit growth instead of revenue growth because its revenue growth can be impacted by its less predictable Bitcoin trading business. The company is looking for Q1 to be the low point for gross profit growth due to last year's leap year and currency headwinds. Image source: Getty Images Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2025, Block stock is at one of its lowest valuations in quite awhile. XYZ PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. While the company missed some headline numbers, the earnings report overall was solid, with nice double-digit gross profit growth at both its two main businesses. Meanwhile, the company was very bullish about 2025, looking for growth to begin to accelerate after the first quarter. It sees the introduction of AfterPay into Cash App as a big opportunity, while it's looking to pour money into advertising for Square after spending 2024 revamping the the technology behind it. Given Block's valuation and upbeat outlook, this looks like a good time to buy the stock on the dip. Geoffrey Seiler has positions in Block. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Block.

Learn More Key Points The market is finally getting excited about Roku (ROKU 2.48%) stock again. The streaming company has been putting up some strong numbers, and trends are working in its favor. If you didn't buy the stock over the past year, you lost out on the beginning of its rebound. But it's just getting started, and if you have some time to hold on to the stock, you can benefit from the rest of a rebound as the business strengthens and the stock climbs. Here are three reasons to buy Roku stock right now. Roku has had a bit of a bumpy ride moderating from pandemic acceleration, but it's stabilized to steady, double-digit growth in both of its businesses. Although it's more known for its device business, it makes much more money from its ad business. The device business has proven resilient over the past few years, with customers continuing to buy from a broad range of price points, bringing them into the Roku ecosystem. Roku is the top-selling operating system in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico and has been for the past six years. From there, Roku can monetize viewers with its free Roku channels and ad-share model with ad-supported channels like Netflix and Disney. Even though the ad business was under pressure from inflation and reduced ad spend over the past two years or so, users and viewing hours have increased reliably. In the 2024 fourth quarter, members increased 12% year over year to nearly 90 million, which it has already surpassed, and viewing hours rose by 18%. Management said that it will not report these metrics starting with the 2025 first quarter, but that it expects viewer households to keep growing. Roku already has more than half of U.S. broadband households on its platform, and to continue adding new customers, it's making a bigger play for the international market. It signed new deals with partners throughout Latin America and in the U.K. last year, and it's expanding to other global markets. Considering its success and top position in its current markets, it has a good chance to perform well in new markets. It's focusing on getting the business up right now, and that could negatively impact metrics like average revenue per user (ARPU) in the interim. ARPU was trending flat or negative for a while, but it was up 4% year over year in the fourth quarter. The downtrend has been partially tied to the expansion, because more people on the system without a commensurate increase in ad spend will do that. The strategy is to onboard members first and generate increasing engagement, which brings on more advertisers and ad spend. It's a long-haul focus, but the market doesn't appreciate the short-term sacrifice. Net losses have been a sore spot for Roku over the past few years. It's struggling to turn a profit, and investors have been losing patience. But it's making progress. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and free cash flow have been positive for more than a year, and they increased 62% and 16% year over year, respectively, in the fourth quarter. The device business hasn't been profitable even on a gross basis, but it's the gateway to the more profitable ad business. Device sales were only 16% of the total in the fourth quarter, and the gross loss more than doubled year over year. Management said the industry didn't live up to expectations for holiday sales, and there's been discounting to get rid of excess inventory.

Learn More Key Points Energy demand in the U.S. continues its upward trajectory, driven primarily by the insatiable energy needs of data centers and their power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In light of this, companies are seeking sustainable solutions to meet their growing energy requirements. This is where Bloom Energy (BE 4.25%) comes into play. The company's fuel cell technology offers a scalable and reliable means for companies to meet their energy needs while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint. Over the past year, Bloom has secured several significant contracts. Here's what investors should know about this up-and-coming energy company and the investment opportunity it presents. Bloom Energy specializes in designing, manufacturing, and deploying solid oxide fuel cell systems. Its Bloom Energy Servers use solid oxide technology to convert a variety of fuels, including natural gas, biogas, and hydrogen, through an electrochemical process without combustion. These servers can be clustered together to produce on-site electricity for commercial, industrial, or data center purposes. Aside from cleaner energy production, Bloom's servers are appealing because this technology is ready to deploy today. The company can install these systems in less than 50 days, and this energy can be used to complement energy supplied by the grid. Companies can also install these servers to function independently, eliminating dependence on the grid altogether. Image source: Bloom Energy. This makes Bloom's product appealing, especially for technology companies looking to address their growing data needs today. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, data center power demand could grow 15% annually through 2030, accounting for 8% of total power consumption in the U.S. This boom in demand comes at a good time for Bloom Energy, which has struggled financially since going public in 2018. Over the past 12 months, the company lost $129.5 million against revenue of $1.26 billion. While the company has made progress and improved margins, securing big-name clients helps validate its offering and provides an on-ramp for further growth. BE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts In May, Bloom announced a power capacity agreement with Intel, which calls for the installation of additional megawatts of its Energy Serve at Intel's data center in Santa Clara. This will result in Silicon Valley's largest fuel-cell-powered high-performance computing data center. The company also partnered with Nvidia-backed artificial intelligence (AI) hyperscaler CoreWeave to provide on-site power with its fuel cells, which are set for installation around the third quarter of this year. A few months ago, it also signed an agreement with American Electric Power Company to purchase up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of its fuel cells for data centers and other large energy users. American Electric is one of the largest electric utility companies in the country, with a 39,000-mile transmission network. Morningstar called the deal \"a potential game changer for Bloom.\" The stock is a bit expensive, at 3 times its forecast sales this year and 50 times its forecast earnings. That said, signing agreements with several big names helps validate its product, and the successful deployment of its servers could help it grow very nicely over the next several years. Analysts covering the stock project Bloom will turn a net profit in 2025, with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) of $0.11. It would be its first full-year profit since going public in 2018. They also project revenue growth of 18% to $1.67 billion in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to over $2 billion. Bloom Energy's recent agreements with American Electric and technology companies are a big win. They allow the company to showcase its product and ability to provide quick-to-deploy, scalable energy solutions. Its agreement with American Electric is notable, as the energy company forecasts a 20% annual growth rate in commercial load over the next three years. As with all growth stocks early in their growth stories, Bloom Energy comes with risk if its deals fall through. Its expensive valuation makes the stock vulnerable to a drop from here. That said, the company is making inroads with new agreements in the evolving energy landscape driven by AI demand and looks like a compelling growth stock for long-term investors to add today.

Learn More Key Points Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 2.87%) (BRK.B 2.27%) recently released its full-year operating results and capped off another excellent year for investors. The stock finished the year up 25.5%. Since Warren Buffett became CEO six decades ago, Berkshire has delivered nearly 20% compounded annually to investors. This stellar long-term performance is why investors closely monitor Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio. Every quarter, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires institutional investors with over $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F, which discloses their investment holdings. While Berkshire has trimmed several of its stock positions over the past year, it continues to hold on to some of its best performing stocks. Here are three Buffett stocks that could make an excellent addition to your long-term portfolio today. Image source: The Motley Fool. American Express (AXP 2.30%) has carved out a place as consumers' go-to card thanks to its strong branding and marketing. Since it first entered the credit card market in the 1950s, the credit card company has positioned itself as a premium offering that customers often associate with luxury and decadence. Over the decades, American Express has attracted high-earning, high-spending customers with its invite-only Centurion Card (Black Card). This card is the ultimate signal of luxury, reportedly requiring a quarter of a million dollars in annual spending and commanding an annual fee of $5,000. Its Platinum Card is a more affordable option, with a $695 annual fee, and rewards high-spending consumers with perks like airport lounges, travel rewards, and credits for dining and entertainment. The company earns interest income from its credit card loans. Also, it collects a small fee for every transaction through its network, helping it benefit from periods of growing consumer spending alongside an expanding economy. This, coupled with its recognizable brand, is why Berkshire Hathaway invested in the company in the 1990s and continues to hold its shares today, making it one of Berkshire's longest held investments in its stock portfolio. Last year was another excellent one for the company, which grew revenue by 10% to $74 billion while earnings per share (EPS) surged 25% to $14.02. The stock recently fell after CFO Christophe Le Caillec guided down earnings growth for the first quarter. However, the recent weakness in the stock looks like a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors. Moody's (MCO 2.25%) is another stock that has been a part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio since it spun off from Dun & Bradstreet in 2000. Moody's is the second largest credit rating agency in the United States, behind only S&P Global. Because of the high barriers to entry, Moody's enjoys a significant competitive advantage. Not only do regulations make it hard to break into credit ratings, but all of the major credit rating agencies (including Fitch Ratings, the third largest in the U.S.) have built up their businesses and reputations over a century or longer. Moody's benefits from the ongoing growth of public and private debt, which requires their expertise in credit ratings to help investors manage their risks effectively. In the past few years, rising interest rates have put pressure on corporate debt issuance, weighing on one of Moody's primary sources of revenue. Despite this, the company has performed well thanks to its Moody's Analytics segment, which provides risk-related data and analytics. With its high retention rates and a subscription-based revenue model, this segment helps offset weakness in its credit ratings business and provides a steady income stream. Moody's continues to grow steadily and has an excellent operating margin of around 42%. The company continues to reward investors through dividends and share buybacks, and is a stellar Buffett stock to hold on to for the long haul. Chubb (CB 1.34%) is one of Berkshire Hathaway's more recent stock additions in the past couple of years, with the conglomerate adding 27 million shares in late 2023 and early 2024. The company had accumulated this position over several quarters, keeping its purchase confidential so as not to tip its hand to investors. Chubb is a large multinational insurance company with a global reach. The company's coverages include property, casualty, professional liability, cybersecurity, environmental, marine, and general liability. What makes Chubb stand out is its ability to balance risk and price its policies appropriately to earn an underwriting profit consistently. Over several decades, the company has consistently outperformed peers in underwriting profitability, which is a big reason it has grown its dividend payout for 31 consecutive years. Another benefit to owning Chubb is its ability to capitalize on today's higher interest rate environment. Chubb has a significant investment portfolio of $150 billion. With interest rates today higher than in the previous decade, Chubb can enjoy increased yields on its fixed-income investments, contributing to its overall profitability. Last year, Chubb earned $5.9 billion in net investment income, an increase of 20% from 2023. Chubb has a proven track record of underwriting discipline and is well positioned to grow alongside an expanding economy or inflation, should it persist. The company's global reach, pricing power, and significant investment portfolio make it another excellent Buffett stock to hold on to for the long haul.

Learn More Key Points AGNC Investment (AGNC 1.26%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT), but it isn't a landlord, as are most REITs. This changes the equation for investors and could make the ultra-high 13%+ dividend yield a bad choice. But, if you understand what you are buying, there is a reason to buy this REIT today. Most REITs buy physical properties, but AGNC Investment is a mortgage REIT. It buys mortgages that have been pooled together into bond-like securities. These securities trade all day, and their prices can -- and do -- change dramatically based on factors such as interest rate changes, property market dynamics, and mortgage repayment rates, among other things. While you might be able to keep fairly close tabs on a property-owning REIT, it would be very difficult to track AGNC Investment, or any other mortgage REIT, with the same level of certainty. Image source: Getty Images. AGNC Investment makes the difference between the interest it earns on the securities it buys and its cost of capital. The cost of capital notably includes the interest costs of leverage that uses the portfolio as collateral. This adds another level of risk to the equation, since a drop in the value of the portfolio could potentially trigger a margin call. That, in turn, could force AGNC Investment to sell assets into a market downturn. If you are an income investor looking for a simple to understand REIT, you probably won't want to buy AGNC Investment, even though it has a huge dividend yield. In fact, if you look at the history of the dividend and the stock price, you will notice a very frightening trend, given that the dividend has declined steadily for years and, not shockingly, so has the stock price. That wouldn't be a good outcome if you are hoping to have a material source of income today and for some distant tomorrow. AGNC data by YCharts A traditional dividend investor, who is looking to live off the income their portfolio generates, would probably see AGNC Investment as something of a yield trap. Indeed, long-term investors would now have less income and less capital coming in the door. A better option for such investors would be a company with a long history of regular dividend increases, like the companies that make up the highly elite group known as Dividend Kings. But there are some investors who might still be interested in AGNC Investment. And a key reason for that is the stock's total return, which, despite the falling stock price and declining dividend, is strongly positive. How does that math work? AGNC data by YCharts The first answer is dividend reinvestment, which is a key component of total return. If you examine AGNC Investment's dividend history, you'll see that it paid $48.64 from its initial public offering through to the end of 2023. But the share price has only declined around from $20 per share at the IPO to $10.50 or so. This means that the mortgage REIT has paid out nearly $40 per share in dividends over and above the share price decline. If dividends were reinvested, it would more than offset the declines in stock price to generate a positive return. Although it requires some deep consideration, there are three reasons to buy AGNC Investment given this fact. Asset allocation basically requires investors to spread their investment portfolio around a bit. If the list of assets you want exposure to includes mortgages, then AGNC Investment, given its total return, is actually a decent option. But in this scenario, the goal is exposure to mortgage securities, not income. If you are planning to spend the dividends, you could end up disappointed by the outcome. For some income investors, meanwhile, the trade-off that AGNC Investment offers might be worthwhile. Yes, the stock has lost over half of its value since its IPO. But it has paid out far more in dividends. The caveat is that the income stream has trended lower over time, so AGNC Investment remains a bad choice for investors who need to have a sustainable and/or growing income stream. But if you can wrap your head around the nuance here between the dividends and the drop in the share price, there could be a place for an investment like AGNC in your portfolio if you aren't worried about leaving anything behind for heirs. All of that said, the share price of AGNC Investment will normally track closely with the value of the securities it owns in its portfolio. The price of the portfolio, which the company reports quarterly as tangible net book value, usually doesn't change dramatically from quarter to quarter (though it can during housing market and stock market dislocations). Meanwhile, AGNC Investment pays dividends on a monthly cadence. If you are looking to generate as much income as possible over a short period of time, the ultra-high yield here might be worth the risk. Just make sure that you are thinking in months, and not years, if you are thinking about AGNC Investment in this way. If you are trying to fund your retirement with dividend income, AGNC Investment probably won't be the kind of stock you want to own. Thus, most dividend investors will likely want to avoid this ultra-high-yield REIT. But given the dynamics of the dividend and the share price, total return investors who are looking for a mortgage investment might like it. So, too, could investors who can wrap their heads around the complex interplay between dividends and share price. And then there's a small group who may appreciate the large monthly pay dividend as a way to generate some additional short-term income.

Learn More Key Points XRP's (XRP 6.31%) token price is heading lower in Friday's trading. The cryptocurrency was down 2.4% over the previous 24 hours as of 6:50 p.m. ET. Meanwhile,\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0was down 0.3% over the stretch, and\u00a0Ethereum was down 3%. The cryptocurrency market's pullback is continuing in today's trading, and the momentum is weighing on XRP. The cryptocurrency's token price is still up 274% over the last year but is now down 33.5% from its high. XRP is seeing another round of sell-offs today as investors digest potential risk factors tied to new tariffs and inflationary pressures. Recent economic data has shown inflation coming in hotter than expected, and additional tariffs might worsen the situation. The crypto market's bull run has been facilitated by expectations that moderating inflation would pave the way for lower interest rates. Investors are moving out of higher-risk investments to adjust for the possibility that rates will remain higher for longer. XRP and other cryptocurrencies have also seen pullbacks in conjunction with Nvidia's recent earnings report and concerns about valuation profiles for growth-dependent artificial intelligence stocks. While XRP has risen to become the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its token price will likely continue to be highly volatile in the near term. The cryptocurrency's valuation profile remains highly speculative and will continue to be prone to big swings depending on macroeconomic and token-specific developments. XRP has recently experienced a substantial valuation pullback, and it's reasonable to expect that its token price will continue heading lower if there are signs of mounting macroeconomic pressures. On the other hand, shifting regulations in the crypto space and other catalysts could help power a return to bullish trading. Keith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Key Points PubMatic (PUBM -23.91%) stock got hit with big sell-offs in Friday's trading. The advertising-technologies company's share price closed out the daily session down 23.9%. The S&P 500 index closed out the day up 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 1.6%. PubMatic reported its fourth-quarter results after the market closed, and posted earnings that beat the market's expectations. On the other hand, sales missed Wall Street's guidance -- and the company's forward guidance raised a big red flag. PubMatic posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.41 on sales of $85.5 million in Q4. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 on sales of $88.2 million. Revenue for the period was up just 1.1% year over year, and earnings per share were down 8.9% compared to the prior-year period. PubMatic's margins weakened along key lines, and the company's forward guidance didn't offer much for investors to be excited about. For the current quarter, PubMatic is guiding for sales to come in between $61 million and $63 million. At the midpoint of the guidance range, that suggests a 7% year-over-year sales decline. On a sequential quarterly basis, sequential quarterly sales would decline at a 27.5% annual rate based on the midpoint of the target. PubMatic is continuing to manage costs effectively, but the weak sales growth outlook raises questions about the business' prospects. Recent earnings reports suggest that the company is losing ground in the highly competitive ad tech market. Keith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn More Key Points FuboTV (FUBO -13.92%) stock sank in Friday's trading following the company's fourth-quarter earnings release. The streaming video specialist's share price closed out the day down 13.9%. FuboTV published its Q4 results before the market opened this morning, and the company's earnings beat in the period wasn't enough to offset the market's disappointment with a big sales miss. Making matters worse, the company's forward guidance came in much worse than anticipated. In the fourth quarter, FuboTV recorded a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted loss of $0.02 per share on sales of $431.82 million. The company's adjusted loss beat the average analyst estimate by $0.09 per share, but revenue for the period came in $13.35 million short of the target. Sales were up roughly 7.8% year over year, and the business closed out the period with record paid subscribers and revenue per user -- but there was a big catch. Despite today's pullback, FuboTV stock is still up roughly 52% this year thanks to the company's big investment partnership deal with Disney. On the other hand, it looks like the platform will face some significant performance headwinds in the near term. In the first quarter, FuboTV expects sales for its North America segment to come in between $400 million and $410 million, suggesting annual growth of 3% at the midpoint of the target range. But with the company guiding for subscribers to decline roughly 4%, it looks like that growth will be powered by pricing increases. For the company's rest-of-the-world segment, FuboTV expects sales to be between $7.5 million and $8.5 million in Q1 -- representing a year-over-year decline of 5% at the midpoint of the guidance range. Meanwhile, total subscribers in the category are projected to decline roughly 16%. Keith Noonan has positions in Walt Disney. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Walt Disney and fuboTV.

Learn More Key Points Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a boon for a number of businesses, including Oracle (ORCL 0.79%). AI energized the tech company's fortunes, sending its shares soaring 50% over the past 12 months through the week ending Feb. 21. One factor that drove the stock higher is the company's participation in the U.S. government's Stargate program. This project plans to invest $500 billion into the nation's AI infrastructure, providing a tailwind to Oracle's revenue growth. But the stock is down from the 52-week high of $198.31 reached in December. Does this present an opportunity to buy shares? Here's an analysis of the tech company to arrive at an answer. Oracle has strengths that make it a compelling investment. Its origins lie in databases, which is where digital information is stored, including the data needed for AI. So its success in the AI sector is a natural extension of its roots. But what ended up supercharging the AI business was its cloud computing infrastructure. Chief technology officer Larry Ellison said, \"Oracle continues to win large AI training workloads because we're faster and less expensive than the other infrastructure clouds.\" Artificial intelligence isn't like a software program that runs on your computer. After the AI model is built, it must be trained to make correct decisions by analyzing mountains of data stored in databases. The training is costly, requiring an army of fast, powerful computers, such as the ones in Oracle's cloud. This has led businesses to use the company to train their AI. Consequently, cloud revenue rose 24% year over year to $5.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30. That strong performance helped the company's total second-quarter sales to grow 9% year over year to $14.1 billion. CEO Safra Catz says the company is experiencing a record level AI demand, and that its growth \"will continue to climb even higher.\" That's likely because Oracle captured Meta Platforms, which is investing aggressively in AI, as a customer in its fiscal third quarter, so the social media giant's revenue contributions aren't part of the second-quarter numbers. Specifically, management anticipates fiscal 2025 revenue to grow by double digits over the prior year. That would be impressive considering fiscal 2024's $53 billion in sales, a 6% year-over-year increase. Oracle's AI-fueled sales growth enabled it to increase fiscal second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) by 24% year over year to $1.10. This was the latest quarter of rising EPS since the AI boom began with the arrival of ChatGPT in late 2022, converting its success in the technology into gains for shareholders. Data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months. However, that could change in upcoming quarters since management expects fiscal 2025 capital expenditures (capex) to double the $6.9 billion spent in 2024. To keep up with customer demand, Oracle is expanding its cloud infrastructure. One facility is so large, there are permits to build three small modular nuclear reactors to power it. Although capex is rising, the company's financials give it the bandwidth to support this. Its operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months totaled $20.3 billion. Oracle's AI success and solid financials make the company a great investment. This leads to the question of whether now is the right time to buy shares. One consideration is valuation. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is the highest among some of its key competitors in the cloud computing space. Data by YCharts. This indicates Oracle shares are more expensive than the competition, suggesting its stock is still overpriced despite dropping from its 52-week high. So now is not the best time to buy. Wait for it to fall further before grabbing shares. Alternatively, you can buy a few shares now and use dollar-cost averaging to build your position over time -- purchasing equal dollar amounts at regular intervals takes some of the guesswork out of which direction Oracle shares will go from their current price, while allowing you to own a piece of this successful AI tech company.

Learn More Key Points United Parcel Service (UPS 1.19%) offered investors good news when it reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings in late January. It also provided investors with news that could easily be seen as bad. But if you step back from that bad news, you'll see that UPS, as the company is normally called, is actually willing to take some near-term pain to provide a long-term benefit to the business. Here's why UPS is worth buying as it sits below $120 per share. If you see a large brown delivery truck, you probably know what company it represents. The same is true if you see a delivery person in a crisp brown suit. While UPS doesn't have any kind of ownership on the color brown, it most certainly is associated closely with the mundane hue. There's a reason for that: UPS's trucks and delivery people are ubiquitous throughout the United States. That speaks to the breadth of its pickup and delivery network. Image source: Getty Images. For the most part, UPS does a very good job of getting packages from one place to another quickly and cost-effectively. It also has a store network that allows it to take returns, an increasingly important aspect of the economy given the growth of online retail (more on this in a second). That said, package delivery is a competitive business and getting more competitive. Specifically, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has created its own in-house delivery network. Keeping costs in check has become an important factor in the competitive landscape. UPS has addressed this by closing facilities and automating as much of the delivery process as possible. A prime example is the use of RFID tags to track packages so that human beings don't have to be as involved in the sorting process. That said, modernizing an established business isn't cheap or easy, even when it's the right thing to do. UPS data by YCharts During the earlier days of the coronavirus pandemic, investors got excited about package delivery. More online shopping by people stuck at home meant more packages that needed to be shipped. But Wall Street has a habit of taking good ideas way too far when it comes to stock prices. And that appears to be what happened with UPS' shares, which peaked at more than $230 in 2022. UPS' stock price plunged to below $120 when it became clear that the world had learned to live with the virus. Along the way, the business had to face down some demons that had built up over time. That notably included selling off noncore businesses, updating its operations, refocusing on more profitable business lines such as healthcare, and attempting to diversify its customer base. This complicated the financial picture, turned investors off in a big way, and probably exacerbated the share price decline. That said, the company turned an important corner in the back half of 2024. Specifically, revenue and earnings were lower year over year in the first and second quarters of 2024 but higher in both the third and fourth quarters. This is great news and suggests that UPS has finally found its footing again. There's only one problem. When UPS released fourth-quarter results, it also announced that it was going to change its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon.com. The goal is to reduce Amazon volume by 50%, which is a huge change. Why make this decision right as the broader business seemed to be turning higher again? The answer is that Amazon is low-profit volume and UPS is making a decision that will help improve its long-term margin outlook. Doing that now, meanwhile, is really a sign that UPS is finally working from a position of strength again. Basically, after years of reworking its business, it's now in a position where it can handle this change. Notably, Amazon isn't going away as a customer and probably won't anytime soon. The key on that front is that Amazon doesn't have a strong return network, but UPS does. So UPS is basically leaning into a strength by leaning away from what amounts to low-value commodity services that Amazon is increasingly doing on its own anyway. In all, UPS appears to be making a difficult but astute decision. Is UPS a buy while it's under $120 a share? (It closed on Thursday at $117.63.) My answer is: Most likely, given that it's turned a corner financially and is continuing to work toward improving its business for the long term. Add in a very generous 5.5% dividend yield, and you're getting paid well to wait for Wall Street to catch on to the fundamental successes taking shape at UPS.

Learn More Key Points Cryptocurrencies have had an incredible run over the past few months, but that's coming to an end as many altcoins are crashing this week. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Solana (SOL 8.11%) had dropped 14.5% over the past week as of 4 p.m. ET, Chainlink (LINK 5.92%) was down 15.9%, Sui (SUI 7.58%) had fallen 14.9%, and Cardano (ADA 6.55%) was down 17.4%. For cryptos, the policy and enforcement environment in the U.S. is improving, but the market is looking at the economy as a potentially damaging headwind in 2025. President Donald Trump said tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico could begin next week and more may be coming. That could make products more expensive for consumers and slow down economic activity, at least temporarily. Then there are mass layoffs of government workers, which could also impact economic activity short term. These are the kind of changes that resulted in the Commerce Department reporting a 0.2% reduction in spending in January despite a 0.9% increase in incomes. As has been the case in other surveys, consumers are pulling back their spending, particularly on larger items, as they fear the impact of tariffs and other economic uncertainty. Cryptocurrencies are inherently risky assets and they trade correlated with risky growth stocks as well. So, as investors question the future growth of the U.S. economy it makes sense growth stocks and crypto would both drop as investors look for safety. The market is also seeing an unwinding of some of the crypto speculation that drove valuations over the past few months. Altcoins are typically more volatile than bigger cryptocurrencies, so they're taking the brunt of the losses. What's interesting is there's momentum on blockchains like Solana and Chainlink in building real utility, like more efficient payment infrastructure and digital asset ownership. But the value of these innovations may not accrue to the tokens themselves because stablecoins are being used as a medium of exchange. If users aren't paying for goods and services with conventional cryptocurrencies and use stablecoins instead, it could mean less demand for conventional cryptocurrencies. During the last period of economic uncertainty in 2022, the crypto market dropped dramatically and that could happen again if the economy slows down. What's notable about the last drop was that it didn't even coincide with a recession. Any recession would be unprecedented for the current state of cryptocurrencies, which really came into the public view after the COVID-19 crash early in 2020. We don't know if crypto values will drop as consumers and investors look for safer assets in a recessionary environment, which could come if tariffs and layoffs negatively impact the economy. Bottom line: Uncertainty is here for cryptocurrencies and that's not what investors are looking for. And with the tailwinds of 2024, like ETF listings and the election behind us, buyers look like they're drying up. Travis Hoium has positions in Solana.

Learn More Key Points The crypto market went into a tailspin over the 24 hours before a sharp recovery midday Friday as investors begin to wonder how healthy the economy is and if the high valuations for risky assets are justified. Despite being sold as a hedge against inflation and the economy, crypto traded like a growth stock, and that's become a headwind in 2025. As of 2:00 p.m. ET, Bitcoin (BTC 6.07%) is flat over the previous 24 hours, but it earlier fell over 6% and broke below $80,000; Ethereum (ETH 4.18%) is off 4% but was down as much as 9.7% at midday; and Dogecoin (DOGE 8.58%) has fallen as much as 12.5% before recovering to a 3.9% loss. This is ahead of the weekend, when liquidity usually goes down, which could result in more trading volatility. The run in crypto over the past four months has been driven by speculation that the new presidential administration would lead to more favorable policies. That has happened, but it hasn't translated to higher crypto valuations because buyers speculating on the move have already come into the market. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are near or below where they were when the U.S. election took place, so the buying pressure has passed. What investors are focused on today is a report from the Commerce Department, which showed a 2.6% increase in prices from a year ago but a decline in consumer spending of 0.2% despite a 0.9% increase in incomes. Consumers are spending less on vehicles and other large items while the cost of food and housing eats into budgets. Since consumers drive the economy, this is a clear concern for investors. You may think the crypto market is insulated from the overall economy, but that's not the case. Cryptocurrencies trade much like growth stocks, which have had a great run over the last few months. But tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China may go into effect next week, and consumers are already pulling back their spending. That could lead to worsening economic conditions and less money for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. Oddly enough, the economic decline may hit crypto before it hits the companies that will see lower revenue. Coming into 2025, the idea was that an improved policy environment would be good for cryptocurrencies. And while the policy environment has improved, the crypto market hasn't responded positively. That's in large part because there hasn't been enough time for innovation to flourish on the blockchain. Speculation drives prices higher, but it could take years for truly innovative companies to take hold. We can see some of that development happening, but innovation is taking place with stablecoins, not traditional cryptocurrencies, as the medium of exchange. That may mean less money flows into Bitcoin and meme coins like Dogecoin. To make matters worse, Ethereum seems to have fallen out of favor as faster, cheaper blockchains gain adoption. Add it all up and uncertainty is the norm, and that may push cryptocurrencies lower for the foreseeable future. Travis Hoium has positions in Ethereum.

The stock is down 10.5% as 2 p.m. ET on Friday, while the stock is still up 224% in the last year. Here's why Hims & Hers stock fell this week. Q4 2024 showed more blockbuster growth for Hims & Hers. Revenue growth accelerated to 95% year over year, hitting $481 million in the last three months of the year. Gross margin remained high at 77% in the period, leading to increased operating leverage as the business scales. The company generated just under $200 million in free cash flow in 2024 compared to $47 million in 2023, which shows that Hims & Hers can self-fund its growth. And the company is being aggressive to try and win new customers for its online health and medications marketplace. It spent $679 million on marketing in 2024, which was 46% of its revenue. However, given how fast revenue is growing and its positive free cash flow, Hims & Hers seems to be getting a good return on this marketing spend. So what's the problem? Why is the stock down? Well, besides the fact that Hims & Hers stock has been on a tear in recent quarters and was likely due for a pullback, investors are concerned over the company's new weight loss drug programs. Since GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic have been in a shortage, Hims & Hers used a loophole in the law that allowed it to produce these drugs even though they were developed by other companies such as Novo Nordisk. Now, the official shortage has been lifted. Although Hims & Hers is saying it will still make its own compounded GLP-1 drugs in 2025, it is up in the air whether the U.S. government or court systems will allow the company to sell these weight loss drugs anymore, which were a huge boost to revenue growth in 2024. The good news is, Hims & Hers is not just weight loss drugs. The vast majority of its revenue still comes from its older products in treatment areas such as dermatology, hair loss, and sexual drive. In 2025, management is guiding for revenue to grow to between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion compared to just under $1.5 billion in 2024. Over the long term, management believes the company can hit at least 20% adjusted profit margins. While adjusted profit margins are not actually important for investors (even if management teams highlight them), it could lead to a 15% free-cash-flow margin due to Hims & Hers' asset-light business model. A 15% margin on $2.4 billion in revenue equals $360 million in annual free cash flow. Given the huge marketing opportunity ahead and Hims & Hers' fast historical growth, I think the company can hit $5 billion in revenue within the next few years, which would be good news for investors.

Learn More Key Points It's been an eventful week for investors in Lucid Group (LCID -0.45%). The electric vehicle (EV) stock was already tanking ahead of earnings after getting a massive analyst downgrade when it dealt a big blow to investor confidence by announcing its CEO's sudden departure. That overshadowed Lucid's big production guidance for 2025, and the stock plunged this week -- it was trading 27% lower through Friday noon, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Here's all you need to know. Lucid's fourth-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $234.4 million, and the company narrowed its net loss to $0.22 per share from $0.29 a share during the quarter. 2024 is a \"transformational year\" for Lucid, according to interim CEO Marc Winterhoff -- \"interim\" because alongside its numbers, Lucid also announced the departure of its CEO, Peter Rawlinson, and said it is looking for a new CEO while Winterhoff spearheads the company. As is often the case, the abrupt leadership change seems to have spooked investors. Lucid stock took a big hit earlier this week, even before it announced its numbers or a new CEO, after Redburn Atlantic analyst Tobias Beith slashed the stock's price target to only $1.13 a share\u00a0from $3.50 per share. Beith believes Lucid will have to significantly boost volumes for its to-be-launched midsize platform to retain its cost advantage and vehicle efficiency, which will mean significant cash outflows for the company. Beith is also not too optimistic about Gravity SUV gross margins. Lucid recently started delivering the Gravity SUV and is betting heavily on it for growth. Lucid expects to more than double its production to 20,000 EVs in 2025, but investors aren't convinced given Lucid's poor execution history and the uncertainty that comes with a new leader at the helm.

Learn More Key Points Shares of payment platform DLocal (DLO -30.51%) were down 29% this week at 12:30 p.m. ET, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. DLocal reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and missed analysts' expectations for sales and earnings per share. While its guidance to grow total payment volume (TPV) by 40% in 2025 is promising, the company and its shorter-term profitability woes worried the market. DLocal's payment platform solves for the complexities of trying to sell anything in an emerging market. Offering over 900 payment options in roughly 40 countries, DLocal boosts its customers' conversion rates in emerging markets, home to over 2 billion people. The company's platform is a no-brainer solution for some of the world's largest companies, such as Amazon, Shopify, Netflix, and Spotify. Growing alongside juggernauts like these, DLocal again delivered impressive TPV growth of 45% in Q4 -- even if this was below expectations. However, the company's declining margins and take rate were the bigger concern. Although TPV was up 45% in Q4, revenue and gross profit only rose 15% and 6%, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined by 7%. Similarly, the company's take rate (gross profit divided by TPV) slipped from 1.2% in Q3 to 1.1% after it had remained flat (an improvement) over the last three quarters. In oversimplified terms, the volatile nature of operating in emerging economies can lead to short-term disappointments like this for DLocal. Ultimately, DLocal remains a profitable enterprise that generates positive free cash flow and will likely see continued TPV growth. Trading at 24 times earnings today and 16 times next year's earnings, DLocal remains one of my favorite growth stocks. Interested investors will need to brace for volatility with this one, however.

Learn More Key Points Chinese stocks struggled today after President Donald Trump said additional tariffs on Chinese imports are slated to go into effect Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 3.3%, suffering one of its worst days since mid October. Shares of Alibaba (BABA -2.96%) traded 2.7% lower as of 11:30 a.m. ET, while shares of Tencent (TCEHY -2.62%) traded 2.4% lower. Shares of GDS Holdings (GDS 0.26%) initially slid almost 8% in pre-market trading but had recouped most of those losses by 11: 30. Investors who thought tariffs would be more of a negotiating tactic will see their thesis put to the test next week after Trump said that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that he previously paused will go into effect Tuesday. Meanwhile, he also said there would be an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. While China's response to Trump's initial 10% tariffs was more muted, officials didn't hold back this time. \"If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will take all necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests,\" a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, according to CNBC. \"We urge the U.S. side to not repeat its own mistakes, and to return as soon as possible to the right track of properly resolving conflicts through dialogue on equal footing.\" Chinese tech stocks had been on a tear this year, with the emergence of DeepSeek leading investors to grow bullish on artificial intelligence in the country. Furthermore, with China's economy still struggling, the government had seemingly thrown its support behind the tech sector. President Xi Jinping recently held a rare meeting with tech and start-up leaders in the country that largely encouraged the group. Still, the additional tariffs throw a wrench in what had been a badly needed rally for Chinese stocks. \"The extra 10% is frustrating because it keeps uncertainty alive and reinforces the risk that this becomes a pattern,\" Billy Leung, an investment strategist at Global X ETFs, was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News article. In the same article, Kristina Clifton, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, was quoted as saying her team expects the Chinese government to bolster spending to try and reduce the impact of tariffs on the Chinese economy. When you invest in Chinese stocks, the regulatory landscape in China and geopolitical tensions are going to be a big part of the story. Tariffs and export controls by the U.S. have been in play since Trump's first term and through former President Joe Biden's term, and have now ramped up even further in Trump's second term. Many believed Trump would use tariffs as more of a bargaining chip, and this may be the end result. However, the administration likely at least needs the market to take tariffs seriously for a little while. Trump has also been unpredictable, so it's hard to say with certainty that he won't go through with his full tariff agenda. Due to the struggles in China's economy and the stock market in 2024, investors can likely buy most Chinese tech stocks at cheaper valuations than those in the U.S., and a lot of these companies have tremendous growth prospects. However, they will likely be volatile due to factors like geopolitical tensions or China's regulatory regime, so keep this in mind and take a long-term approach if you invest.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that Generation Z will represent about 30% of the American workforce by 2030. This generation brings a fundamentally different outlook on careers and life compared to previous generations. The traditional dream of climbing the corporate ladder to a corner office no longer holds the same allure it once did. Today's emerging professionals are increasingly focused on what's termed the \"emotional paycheck\" \u2014 a blend of meaningful work, personal fulfillment and work-life integration. According to recent studies, 75% of Gen Z defines success through personal happiness rather than traditional metrics. This shift is fundamentally reshaping how we view professional achievement and success. Gen Z seeks more than competitive salaries and prestigious titles. Research shows that 65% prioritize workplace culture over compensation when job hunting, while 42% favor employers who prioritize mental health. They actively seek authentic experiences, purposeful work and organizations whose values mirror their own. This mindset is revolutionizing workplace dynamics and redefining what constitutes professional success. Let's explore the key factors driving Gen Z's influence on our modern understanding of success. We'll examine their unique challenges, aspirations and their role in bringing deeper meaning to professional careers. Related: Gen Z Talent Will Walk Away \u2014 Unless You Try These 6 Strategies Gen Z faces significant challenges in today's job market. The traditional belief that higher education guarantees success is rapidly eroding. Let's examine the challenging realities they encounter. College education's broken promise A college degree no longer guarantees financial security. Studies indicate that 24% of Americans consider student loan debt their biggest financial regret. Despite their educational achievements, Gen Z graduates often find themselves in worse financial positions than their predecessors. Putting in more hours for less pay: The real income gap Income disparity significantly impacts Gen Z. They work longer hours than previous generations while earning comparatively less. Entry-level positions frequently offer only half the salary needed for homeownership. This gap leads to widespread frustration and burnout, with 60% of Gen Z workers reporting overwhelming work-related stress. The housing market disconnect: Unattainable dreams Gen Z faces an unprecedented housing affordability crisis. With median home prices reaching $433,100, prospective buyers need annual earnings of approximately $166,600. However, the median household income remains at just $78,538. Housing costs have escalated at more than double the rate of income growth, making homeownership seem increasingly unattainable for many young adults. These statistics paint a challenging picture for Gen Z. They confront a reality where academic achievement and professional dedication don't necessarily translate into financial stability or job satisfaction. This explains their search for alternative paths to success. Related: The 5 Things Gen Z Is Looking for in a Job and Career  Gen Z is actively redefining workplace success. They pursue authentic careers driven by purpose and meaning. This demonstrates their desire for more than just impressive job titles. Gen Z has arrived with transformative intentions. The traditional appeal of corner offices and substantial salaries has given way to a quest for deeper significance. Authenticity vs. career success Gen Z prioritizes authenticity over traditional career advancement. Research shows that only 50% aspire to leadership positions, demonstrating their emphasis on staying true to personal values and identity in the workplace. This fundamental shift reflects how young professionals are redefining success on their own terms. This transformation is actively reshaping workplace dynamics, creating environments where transparency and genuine self-expression are not just valued but actively encouraged and celebrated. The quest for work that matters Purpose drives Gen Z's career decisions. Studies indicate that about 60% choose jobs that align with their values over higher-paying positions. They actively seek roles that resonate with their personal beliefs and enable them to create positive societal impact. Many are gravitating toward emerging fields like sustainable technology, digital innovation and social impact ventures, driven by their desire to contribute to solutions that address global challenges. Blending work and life instead of chasing traditional success Work-life integration is crucial for Gen Z professionals. Research shows that about 70% prioritize positions offering flexibility and autonomy. They seek careers that enhance their lifestyle rather than consume it. This marks a significant shift from previous generations' work-first mindset. Gen Z emphasizes building a well-rounded life where professional achievement is just one aspect of their identity. Their perspective is revolutionizing workplace norms. They champion authenticity, purpose-driven work and lifestyle balance, compelling organizations to evolve. Related: Everything You Need to Know About Hiring and Retaining Gen Z Talent The professional landscape is experiencing unprecedented change, with Gen Z leading this evolution. Today's young workforce seeks deeper meaning beyond financial rewards. Studies reveal that 73% of Gen Z workers prioritize organizational culture over compensation when evaluating job opportunities. This shift is fundamentally transforming workplace success metrics. In today's dynamic work environment, it's crucial to recognize that today's young employees are the future leaders of tomorrow. To effectively prepare for this shift, companies need to adapt and create innovative strategies that resonate with Gen Z employees. While these transformations may be gradual and demand a long-term commitment, the following insights can assist in enhancing your approach to managing Gen Z employees. By gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives and aligning your strategies accordingly, you can bridge the generational gap and foster a more productive work environment. Companies need to adapt by offering flexible work arrangements, transparent communication, robust training programs and a culture that actively promotes inclusivity throughout the hiring process, workplace environment and leadership practices.

It's enough to make you seasick, all the twists and turns, stops and starts, injunctions and stays that have defined the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements. If you're looking for the bottom line, here it is: As of this writing, most business owners are officially required to complete their BOI reporting by March 21. You can file for free at fincen.gov/boi. And if you'd rather not take the time (30 to 60 minutes) to file it yourself, you can always hire out a third-party service to handle this for you. Related: 'Enormous Chaos and Confusion': Do You Need to File a BOI Report? After Another New Ruling, Here's What Business Owners Need to Know. If we look to recent history as our guide, the requirement could very well be rescinded, then reapplied, then rescinded and reapplied again, multiple times over. It's like a game of musical chairs, which is why I recommend that you go ahead and claim your seat now, so you don't, God forbid, blink and find yourself late on your filing and subject to hundreds of dollars in daily fines. It's worth noting that the U.S. Department of Treasury is aware of how volatile the process has been and is open to further modifications on the deadlines imposed and the scope of businesses affected: \u2026in keeping with Treasury's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on businesses, during this 30-day period, FinCEN will assess its options to further modify deadlines while prioritizing reporting for those entities that pose the most significant national security risks. FinCEN also intends to initiate a process this year to revise the BOI reporting rule to reduce the burden for lower-risk entities, including many U.S. small businesses. Most corporations, LLCs and other entities formed by filing documents with a Secretary of State's office are required to file a BOI report by March 21. There are 23 types of entities that are exempt. In general, the exempt companies are those that are already subject to extensive oversight with regard to their beneficial ownership information. Exempt entities include publicly traded companies, insurance companies, credit unions, banks and certain regulated investment firms. Another common exemption is the exemption for \"large operating companies,\" which are defined according to the following criteria: Sole proprietorships are, of course, exempt from BOI reporting, because they are not legally separate entities from their owners, i.e. a sole proprietor is already legally required to report their business income under their own name. A full and complete list of the 23 exemptions can be found in section C.2 of the BOI-FAQ. Related: This New Under-the-Radar Regulation Will Impact Most Businesses. Here's What You Need to Know. The requirement to report the BOI for your business was born of an act that passed through Congress in 2021 called the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). The act passed with bipartisan support and was a part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The main purpose of the CTA was to curb criminal money laundering. Prior to its enactment, business ownership details (who actually benefits financially from the proceeds of a given corporation, LLC, etc.) were difficult or impossible to obtain, often purposefully so. State records became clogged with filings for bogus entities and multi-layered shell companies that could be used to hide one's criminal dealings and/or cheat on one's taxes. Per the CTA, the BOI reporting requirement went into effect Jan. 1, 2024. Non-exempt businesses were given a full year to file the report and would were warned of steep fines, even jail time, should they miss the Jan. 1, 2025 deadline. Not every business owner, however, was jumping out their skin to comply. Some even questioned the constitutionality of the mandate. On May 28, 2024, a group of plaintiffs, led by a gun shop in Texas, filed suit against former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, alleging that actions to enforce the CTA were unconstitutional and, hence, beyond the scope of congressional power. Fast-forward seven months: the plaintiffs won a motion for a preliminary injunction in the case, and the ramifications were heard nationwide. Enforcement of BOI reporting was on hold and, presumably, would remain so until the case was decided. A few weeks later, another monkey wrench: the U.S. government brought an emergency motion to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that, if granted, would allow enforcement of BOI reporting while the other case \u2014 the gun store et al vs. the U.S. Attorney General \u2014 was decided in the federal district court. The government's motion was granted, and the BOI reporting requirement was back on. But before the year came to a close, the Fifth Circuit would produce yet another change of course. On Dec. 26, 2024, a merits panel for the Fifth Circuit vacated the stay issued by the motions panel, which reinstated the district court's preliminary injunction. This was done, they said, to \"preserve the constitutional status quo while the merits panel considers the parties' weighty substantive arguments.\" So, voila, business owners could again breathe easy if they had yet to file their BOI report. And this brings us to Feb. 17, when the enforcement requirement was yet again turned on following the district court's reinstating of the stay, which the Fifth Circuit had vacated. This latest development allows the law to be enforced while the U.S. Attorney General (no longer Merrick Garland) appeals an earlier ruling that declared the law unconstitutional. Should the appeal fail, then the reporting requirement will, yet again, go away, but as of now it stands. Want my advice? Don't dizzy yourself by tracking this back-and-forth soap opera any longer. Just file and be done with it. Entrepreneur Leadership Network\u00ae Contributor CEO of CorpNet.com Want to be an Entrepreneur Leadership Network contributor?\n                \n  Apply now to join.

Most entrepreneurs and business leaders already know they're supposed to be doing public relations, but since few members of the C-Suite have a background in communication, it's understandable if many have only a hazy idea of what public relations means. However, the realities of today's media landscape make it essential for business leaders to develop a more sophisticated understanding of public relations. Indeed, a public relations approach is often necessary to convince skeptical customers to listen to brands, much less purchase their goods or services. Related: How to Build Meaningful Connections in the Digital Networking Era The first thing to understand about public relations is that it's different from branding, marketing, advertising and other forms of outreach. Branding involves creating a unique, appealing identity for the business through the skillful design of visuals and customer service standards. It's the \"feel\" the business wants people to get while interacting with it. Marketing communications take the brand and deploy it into the world through tactics like advertisements, websites and social media. The goal is to connect consumers with products or services, raising awareness of how they can fix people's problems or add value to their lives. Businesses usually have a lot of control over branding and marketing. They decide what the logo looks like, what the ad should say, and where it should be placed. Public relations is different. Related: How To Leverage Social Media to Optimize PR Success and Increase Your Brand Awareness The entire purpose of public relations is to build mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and the public. The informed public's understanding of what they want, need or what would be in their best interests at any given moment is paramount in public relations. In general, this means businesses must temporarily abandon self-centered messaging. For instance, consider the following common PR strategy: a business executive is interviewed by a journalist writing a story about their industry. This is an excellent opportunity for the executive to shape public opinion. They can position their enterprise in a positive light and themselves as a credible authority and leader in their field. Yet the journalist ultimately decides which parts of their quotes to use or whether to use their quotes at all. If the executive only gives the journalist promotional marketing messages in response to questions, the journalist will often refrain from publishing that content. Reporters look for unbiased \u2014 or minimally biased if necessary \u2014 information that would serve to inform the public. The executive understands the educational content the journalist needs and is willing to give it to them, as well as who will get quoted in the article. While public relations gives business leaders a chance to influence public perception, it's helpful to think of it as a demonstration of ethics, decorum and goodwill. By pausing the marketing messages and communicating things that help the public, entrepreneurs and executives show their sterling character. This makes the audience like them more, which makes them more disposed to purchase goods or services from their companies. Given that the audience is central in public relations, the next thing to understand is that today's media landscape is fragmented, which has significant consequences for business leaders and PR professionals. Related: How to Increase Your Brand's Exposure By Integrating These 2 Tools During the heyday of legacy media in the early 20th century, most Americans could be counted to tune into the same small handful of outlets to get their daily news. That is no longer true. Social media platforms have taken off, the media landscape has become deeply divided, and viewers have splintered into increasingly targeted niches. Gaining public attention is no longer as simple as it once was. From a public relations perspective, however, this fragmentation can be both good and bad. It's bad because it's harder to reach many people at once, but it's good because niche audiences tend to be more homogeneous, which makes it easier to craft messages that will resonate with them effectively. Indeed, if PR specialists can find the right small niche and land a compelling message there, they can sometimes see even bigger returns than a mention in a massive outlet. Niche outlets might get fewer viewers, but those viewers are just the right people. Another important feature of today's media landscape is that today's customers ignore advertisements. Nielsen has found that 59% of survey respondents reported being \"somewhat likely\" to \"very likely\" to upgrade their streaming accounts to eliminate commercials, and 64% take other actions to avoid ads. Today's consumers are also more skeptical of businesses' marketing messages. Indeed, according to professional services company PwC, only 30% of consumers trust businesses. Similarly, Marketing Dive reports that 71% of survey participants disregard businesses' corporate social responsibility (CSR) claims, considering them empty promises. This distrust even extends to influencer marketing. A 2023 study showed that only 12% of consumers would likely buy something because an influencer promoted it. New tactics are necessary to attract today's savvy consumers. Studies have found that customers now value brands that display authenticity and openness. They also look for brands that walk the walk, not just talk the talk. These are precisely the kinds of different public relations strategies that leading PR practitioners offer. Related: How Modern PR Differs From Traditional PR \u2014 and Why It's a Crucial Part of Any Successful Business Strategy Effective PR provides you and your business with ways to display your ethics and good character, as well as your goodwill toward the public. PR teams do a lot more than just handle media requests. They also help you get good press, maintain a positive reputation, participate in public discourse and build credibility and trust with the public. In short, building good relationships with today's jaded audiences is their specialty. Strategies like these are essential for overcoming the challenges of today's media landscape.

Chinh, speaking with nearly 40 US businesses in Hanoi, also said that Vietnam was taking measures to rebalance its trade surplus with the US, citing potential imports of aircraft, arms, liquefied natural gas, agriculture goods and pharmaceutical products.

Observed by billions worldwide, the sunrise to sunset fast is one of Islam\u2019s five pillars. While it fosters empathy for the less fortunate, Ramadan is also a celebration of food, with Malaysia\u2019s bustling bazaars offering a wide array of dishes for breaking fast as evening settles. In Kuala Lumpur, securing a spot at these bazaars is highly competitive, as a month\u2019s sales can rival a year\u2019s earnings elsewhere, according to traders. Licences, issued by city hall to hawker associations for as little as 300 ringgit (US$67), were often resold at inflated prices \u2013 sometimes reaching 20,000 ringgit. These costs trickled down to customers, driving up prices and discouraging many from patronising the bazaars.

March 1, 2025e-Paper Updated  - March 01, 2025 01:43 pm IST - New Delhi Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. File \n                                          | Photo Credit: Sudhakara Jain Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal will visit Washington next week as India, and the United States are planning to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, an official said. The visit will start from March 3 and the Minister is expected to be in the U.S. till Friday (March 7), the official added. During the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Washington, India and the U.S. announced their commitment to more than double the two-way commerce to $500 billion by 2030 and negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) by fall of 2025. Mr. Goyal is likely to hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during the visit. The Commerce Ministry has already started engagements with different departments on the India-U.S. trade aspects and related developments. The proposed agreement is an opportunity to boost bilateral trade and investments between the two countries amid threat of U.S. President Donald Trump to impose higher tariffs on Indian goods. Tariffs are import duties imposed and collected by government and paid by the companies to bring foreign goods into the country. The Commerce Ministry takes views of all ministries concerned on proposed trade agreements. The nature of the agreement would be decided by both sides. Mr. Goyal has earlier stated that the two countries can offer concessions and duty reductions, as their economies complement each other. Normally in a free trade agreement, two trading partners either eliminate or significantly reduce customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. Besides, they ease norms to promote trade in services and boost investments. During the first term of U.S. President Donald Trump, the two countries had discussed a mini-trade deal, but it was shelved by the Joe Biden administration as they were not in favour of such pacts. In 2023, the US-India bilateral trade in goods and services stood at $190.08 billion ($123.89 billion in goods and $66.19 billion in services trade). That year, India's merchandise exports to the U.S. stood at $83.77 billion, while imports were $40.12 billion, leaving a trade gap of $43.65 billion in favour of India.  The country's services export to America was $36.33 billion in 2023, while imports were aggregated at $29.86 billion. The trade gap (difference between imports and exports) was $6.47 billion in favour of New Delhi.  During 2021-24, America was the largest trading partner of India. The U.S. is one of the few countries with which India has a trade surplus. In 2023-24, the U.S. was the largest trading partner of India with $119.71 billion bilateral trade in goods ($77.51 billion worth of exports, $42.19 billion of imports, with $35.31 billion trade surplus). India has received $67.8 billion in foreign direct investments from America during April 2000 and September 2024.

March 1, 2025e-Paper Published - March 01, 2025 07:00 am IST FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on cryptocurrencies, in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, U.S., January 23, 2025.   REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n                                          | Photo Credit: KEVIN LAMARQUE U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic and tariff policies and measures to secure his country\u2019s borders may seem justified in terms of promoting his nation\u2019s interests. But they have wider ramifications not only for Americans themselves, but also for the rest of the world. His tariff proposals will result in supply chain disruptions, lead to market and currency volatility, disrupt capital and trade flows, contribute to inflation and cause a decline in world trade and economic growth, worsening the plight of the poor, especially in developing economies. The essence of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic and trade policies can be summarised as follows: a) cut down the size of his nation\u2019s public debt, b) improve his country\u2019s trade balance with its major trading partners, c) woo businesses to relocate or to invest in the domestic economy through a policy of carrot and stick, d) make the American economy efficient by reducing its fiscal deficit, which involves cutting the size of its bureaucracy and eliminating unwanted expenditure on international aid, and e) improve the competitiveness of American products through innovation, technology infusion and through lower prices of energy. Tariff as a weapon For the first time in history, customs tariffs are being used as a weapon to achieve both geopolitical and economic objectives and in so doing, Mr. Trump is signalling to the rest of the world that the era of globalisation and free trade, which culminated in the birth of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995 after years of global consultations and negotiations, is practically dead and a new set of global trade rules based on equality and reciprocity need to be evolved in its place. The WTO recognised the differences in the level of economic and industrial development of the member nations to permit some privileges (the Most Favoured Nation clause) and the right to protect domestic agriculture and industry from foreign competition through protectionist barriers for emerging economies. Now, by demanding equal market access and reciprocity in import taxation, Mr. Trump is not only disrupting global trade relations and global supply chains, evolved over years of intense negotiations, but also equating poorer countries which depend on mono-product exports with the rich industrialised countries. For example, mono-crop countries like Chad, Ivory Coast and Western African Union which only grow and export cotton, cannot survive without some amount of protection for their domestic cotton growers. Impact on trading partners Now coming to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff wars with his trading partners, some seem to have capitulated to his demands of lower tariffs by voluntarily reducing import tariffs across the board, like the recent measures announced by India in its Annual Budget for 2025-26 in the form of customs duty cuts for various imported products, especially the cut in import tariffs for luxury and second-hand cars priced over $40,000 and Harley Davidson motorbikes above 1600cc, from 125% and 50%, respectively, to 70% and 30% now. The European Union has also agreed to achieve parity with the U.S. on import tariffs on automobiles (a reduction from 10% earlier to 2.5% now, which is the tariff America levies on European cars), while at the same time threatening to reciprocate if the U.S. imposed additional tariffs of 25% on other European products. The U.S. however went ahead and announced 25% import taxes on steel and aluminium, which some believe will adversely affect car manufacturing and push up the domestic prices of automobiles in the U.S., hurting German car companies more than anyone else. There is also a belief that China will dump its steel and aluminium products in India and other emerging economies to avoid the U.S. markets due to its steep tariffs, which will hurt domestic steel and aluminium manufacturers in India. Mr. Trump is just a few weeks into his Presidency and his pronouncements on economic and trade measures have already rattled the markets and plunged many national currencies to their lowest levels against the U.S. dollar. Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff announcements also have a potential to disrupt global supply chains and have a negative impact on not just his trading partners, but a whole lot of other countries which are indirectly connected to U.S. trade through its trading partners. For example, the mobile phones, laptops, personal computers, television sets which are exported to the U.S. from China may have components and accessories that are manufactured and supplied by other South-East Asian countries like South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc., whose export earnings may also suffer along with those of China. Similarly, the 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico is going to impact Japan and South Korean car manufacturers who have manufacturing or assembling plants in these countries and have established reliable supply chains within their immediate neighbourhoods and with their own trading partners. The supply chain disruption could also be within the North American region as well. For example, Detroit in the U.S. and Windsor, Ontario in Canada represent the automotive hubs of their respective countries which are in close proximity to each other and are inter-dependent for manpower, materials and components. The Ambassador Bridge border crossing linking these two cities is the busiest commercial crossing on the Canada-U.S. border with people crossing either way several times a day. Needless to say, the automobile manufacturing units located in these two cities will suffer from supply and manpower disruptions, if the 25% tariff is implemented by the U.S. and is reciprocated by Canada. News reports suggest that Canadians are cancelling their travel plans to the U.S., either in retaliation for the proposed tariffs or because of the fear of future job and income losses, or because of a sharp rise in the cost of travel due to the steep fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. This could lead to billions in losses for the American travel industry comprising of air travel, hospitality, and the tourism sector.

File.\n                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters SEBI has launched a centralised database portal for corporate bonds in a bid to create a single, authentic source of information on such securities. The portal \u2014 Bond Central \u2014 has been developed by Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPP) Association in collaboration with Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) comprising stock exchanges and depositories. \u201cThe Bond Central aims to create a single, authentic source of information on corporate bonds issued in India and is intended as an information repository for the public at large and is accessible free of cost,\u201d SEBI said in a statement. This database is expected to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision making among investors and other market participants and will be operated by the OBPP Association, which is a not-for-profit entity with support from MIIs.. Listing out the key features of the portal, SEBI said it is a unified view of corporate bonds across exchanges and issuers ensuring transparency and comparison. Additionally, investors can compare corporate bond prices with Government Securities (G-Secs) and other fixed-income indices for better decision-making. Investors can access to detailed risk assessments, corporate bond documents, and disclosures from the portal enabling investors to evaluate opportunities effectively. The platform standardises corporate bond-related data, reducing information asymmetry and thereby improving trust in the market. The first phase of Bond Central went live on Thursday and additional features will be added on an on-going basis based on stakeholder feedback, SEBI said.

File\n                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters While India is the 3rd largest economy in the world, its \u201cuser\u201d economy ranks 28th in the world, a report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER)\u2019s Prosus Centre for Internet and Digital Economy (CIDE) found. \u201cThis means while India as a country has achieved high level digitalisation at the aggregate level, the level of digitalisation for the average Indian remains fairly modest,\u201d the report said. The density of internet connectivity, which is comparable with other countries, is therefore not as high as the relative size of the digital economy as far as users\u2019 spending is concerned. This stark disparity notwithstanding, the CIDE report says that there is much potential for greater investments to improve investments in digital penetration. \u201cIn fact, India\u2019s digital economy is growing at twice the rate of its overall economy, and is expected to become one fifth of the economy by 2029,\u201d the report says, echoing a similar finding by another ICRIER report released with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in January. Overall, the report uses a \u201cCHIPS\u201d framework to conclude that while India is the third largest overall economy, and the 28th largest digital \u201cuser\u201d economy; it ranks eighth in an \u2018overall\u2019 combination of these two ranking systems. The framework uses criteria like access quality, affordability, \u201cdata intensity,\u201d the fintech industry, AI readiness, and green energy investments. Digital \u2018harnessing\u2019 Indian users and firms rank well in \u201charnessing\u201d the technology that they already have access to, the report says. This strength is largely owed to India\u2019s \u201chigh [information and communications technology (ICT)] services exports and the third-highest market capitalisation of its IT sector, following U.S. and China.\u201d Within India, \u201cSouthern and Western States are far advanced in digitalisation than the Eastern and Northern States,\u201d the report says. India overall has a \u201clong way to go,\u201d the report says. \u201cIndia\u2019s strength in the innovation pillar is reflected through \u2026 decentralised finance, a strong start-up culture and high valuations for unicorns,\u201d but \u201cthe country lags in relative adoption of Consumer [Internet of Things (IoT)] and metaverse, with scores much below the median score for G32 countries.

However, this was considerably slower than the 9.5% growth seen over the same period in 2023. Third quarter growth trailed the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s estimates by 0.2 percentage points. Economy expected to grow 6.4% in Q3: ICRA Indian economy likely to be 'a little weaker' in 2025: IMF MD \u201cThe rebound in growth momentum in Q3 was largely anticipated, as indicated by several high-frequency macroeconomic indicators, including improved GST collections, public spending, electricity generation, and a recovery in export performance,\u201d said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at Care Edge ratings. \u201cOn the demand side, recovery in consumption growth, government expenditure and export growth look encouraging.\u201d The growth was mostly led by a significant uptick of 8.3% in government spending and 6.9% growth in private final consumption expenditure in the third quarter, compared to just 2.3% and 5.7% respectively in the same period last year. Exports too rose 10.4% in the the third quarter of 2024-25, significantly higher than 3% growth the previous year. Imports slid 1.1%, entering negative territory. Experts say this can partly be attributed to the depreciation of the rupee. The increase in government and private consumption offset the slowdown in investment rate, measured by the growth of Gross Fixed Capital Formation, which fell to 5.7% in Q3, from 9.3% in the year ago period. The economy grew at 6.5% and 5.6% in the first two quarters of the current fiscal. Achieving a GDP estimate of 6.5% for the full year would require a 7.6% growth rate in the fourth quarter, said Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran in a media briefing. Although this looks ambitious, he said it could be doable if three factors fall in place: a spike in exports, higher capex pickup, and huge private consumption spending prompted by the Maha Kumbh. Economists, however, feel that the implicit fourth quarter projection is too optimistic. \u201cThe Q3 figures broadly came in line with expectations, but the implied Q4 GDP figures at around 7.5% look significantly optimistic. We expect the 2024-25 GDP figure to be lower than the Central Statistical Organisation\u2019s estimate by around 20 to 30 basis points,\u201d said Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. Aastha Gudwani, the India Chief Economist of Barclays, said the NSO\u2019s annual growth projection was an overestimation, as the high frequency indicators reflect a \u201cmixed bag\u201d, forecasting that the GDP would grow at 6.2% in the current fiscal. On the production side, most of the rise in the Gross Value Added (output without accounting for net taxes) came from the 5.2% growth in primary sector output, compared to just 1.8% in the year ago period. This was largely thanks to agricultural production, as mining output slowed. Output growth slowed in both secondary and tertiary sectors, to 4.8% and 7.4% respectively in the December quarter, compared to 12.4% and 8.3% in the year ago period. On the output data, Mr. Nageshwaran flagged the influence of global risks. \u201cThe near-term global economic outlook is influenced by the trade policies of major economies amid a slowing disinflation. These policies may fuel inflation, lead to tighter financial conditions, and increase market volatility,\u201d he said. The NSO also released the second advance estimates for the current fiscal year, and the first revised estimates for 2023-24, which showed that the real output of the economy grew at a pace of 6.5% that year, down from 9.2% in the year ago period. The data for the first revised estimates of 2023-24 and final estimates of 2022-23 were revised upwards due to a change in computation methodology, according to the NSO statement.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 28, 2025 10:44 pm IST - New Delhi The Employees Provident Fund Organisation building in Mumbai. File \n                                          | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Central Board of Trustees (CBT) of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, which met here on Friday (February 28, 2025), recommended that the current annual rate of interest of 8.25% on provident fund deposits could be retained for accumulations in members\u2019 accounts for 2024-25 too. Trade union representatives had demanded an increase in the interest rate. \u201cThe interest rate would be officially notified by the Government of India, following which EPFO would credit the rate of interest into the subscribers\u2019 accounts,\u201d the Union Labour Ministry said in a release after the meeting, chaired by Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The meeting also discussed the demand for increasing the minimum pension and increasing the slab for contributions towards employees pension scheme. The CBT asked the EPFO to prepare a detailed report on both the issues. On higher pension, the CBT was briefed that 72% of the applications have been processed. Representative of the Centre of Trade Unions (CITU) in the CBT, R. Karumalaiyan told The Hindu that he demanded a hike in the interest rate to at least 8.5%, but the Centre refused. \u201cThe representatives of workers demanded an increase citing price rise and general economic conditions of workers,\u201d he said. It is learnt that Mr. Mandaviya told the meeting that it will not be prudent to increase the rate at present as the Reserve Bank of India recently reduced the repo rate to control inflation and he advised the panel to wait so that the measures taken by the government to ease inflation starts giving results. The Ministry said compared to many other fixed-income instruments, the EPF offers relatively high and stable returns, ensuring steady growth of savings. \u201cThe interest earned on EPF deposits is tax-free (up to a specified limit), making it a highly attractive investment option for salaried individuals. This reflects strong confidence in the credit profile of EPFO\u2019s investments and its ability to deliver competitive returns to its members,\u201d the release said. The CBT also approved key modifications to Employees\u2019 Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme. \u201cA minimum life insurance benefit of \u20b9 50,000 will be provided in cases where an EPF member dies without completing one year of continuous service. This amendment is expected to result in higher benefits for more than 5,000 cases of deaths in service, every year,\u201d the Government said. If a member passes away within six months of their last contribution received, the EDLI benefit will be admissible, provided the member\u2019s name is not stuck off from rolls. \u201cThe modification is estimated to result in benefits for more than 14,000 cases of such death cases every year,\u201d the release said. Also, norms have been relaxed so that a gap of up to two months between two spells of employment will now be considered as continuous service, ensuring eligibility for higher quantum EDLI benefits. \u201cThis change is expected to benefit more than 1,000 cases of deaths in service, every year,\u201d the Government said.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Published - February 28, 2025 12:17 pm IST - New Delhi Investors' wealth tumbled by \u20b97.46 lakh crore in morning trade on Friday (February 28, 2025), in-tandem with a sharp decline in the domestic equity market, with the benchmark Sensex plunging more than 1,000 points following a bearish trend in global equities. Fresh tariff threats that ignited global trade war fears and relentless foreign fund outflows dented investor sentiment. The 30-share BSE benchmark gauge tumbled 1,032.99 points or 1.38% to 73,579.44 during morning trade. Following the sharp decline in equities, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms eroded by \u20b97,46,647.62 crore to \u20b93,85,63,562.91 crore ($4.42 trillion) in morning trade. From the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Maruti, HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services,  Infosys, Mahindra & Mahindra and Titan were the biggest laggards. Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries and Adani Ports were the gainers from the pack. In Asian markets, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading with deep cuts. \"The U.S. market fell, closing at a five-month low, while the U.S. Treasury yields rose following President Donald Trump's new tariff threats,\" Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, said. The U.S. markets ended sharply lower on Thursday (February 27, 2025.) According to V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, stock markets dislike uncertainty and uncertainty has been on the rise ever since Trump was elected the U.S. President. \"The spate of tariff announcements by Trump has been impacting markets and the latest announcement of additional 10% tariff on China is a confirmation of the market view that Trump will use the initial months of his Presidency to threaten countries with tariffs and then negotiate for a settlement favourable to the U.S. \"How China responds to the latest round of tariffs remains to be seen,\" Mr. Vijayakumar said. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth \u20b9556.56 crore on Thursday (February 27, 2025), according to exchange data. Global oil benchmark Brent crude dipped 0.51% to $73.66 a barrel.

For 2023-24, the digital payments landscape has demonstrated remarkable expansion, the finance ministry said in a statement. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) remains the cornerstone of India's digital payment ecosystem, contributing to 80% of the retail payments across the country, it said. The total transaction volume exceeded 131 billion and the value exceeded \u20b9200 lakh crore for the 2023-24. Its ease of use, combined with a growing network of participating banks and fintech platforms, has made UPI the preferred mode of real-time payments for millions of users across the country, it said. As of January, 2025, over 80 UPI Apps, 641 banks are currently live on UPI ecosystem, it said. In FY 24-25 (till Jan, 2025), the People to Merchant (P2M) transactions contributed 62.35% and P2P transactions contributed 37.65% of the overall UPI volume, it said. The contribution of P2M transactions reached 62.35% in January, 2025 where 86% of these transactions are up to a value of \u20b9500, it said, adding, this indicates the trust that UPI enjoys among citizens for making low value payments.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 28, 2025 11:38 am IST - New Delhi Former SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch \n                                          | Photo Credit: ANI India's first woman SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, who faced conflict of interest allegations by the U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg and also political heat thereafter, would complete her three-year tenure later on Friday (February 28, 2025) and will be succeeded by Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey. Before her appointment as SEBI chief, veteran investment banker who has also work with country's leading private sector lender ICICI Bank, joined Sebi's board as a whole-time member in April 2017 and was later elevated as a chairperson in March 2022. She succeeded former IAS officer Ajay Tyagi, who held the top position for five years, from March 1, 2017, to February 28, 2022. Ms. Buch's stint at Sebi Chief has been marked by both significant strides and notable challenges. Taking charge on March 2, 2022, Ms. Buch made history as the first woman to lead the market regulator, as well as the first private-sector individual to hold the position. Although, Ms. Buch in her tenure made significant strides in areas like faster settlements in equities, enhanced FPI disclosures and increasing mutual fund penetration through \u20b9250 SIP, the last year of her tenure saw heightened controversy, when she battled a series of allegations by Hindenburg and the Congress party, while simultaneously dealing with in-house employee protests against \"toxic work culture\". In August last year, Ms. Buch faced pressure to resign after the Hindenburg Research accused her of having conflict of interest that prevented a thorough examination of manipulation and fraud claims at the Adani Group. Hindenburg accused Ms. Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, of investing in offshore entities that were allegedly part of a fund structure in which Vinod Adani -- the elder brother of Adani group founder chairman Gautam Adani -- also had investments. Ms. Buchs had denied the allegation saying the investments were made before she joined the regulator and she had complied with all disclosure requirements. Hindenburg earlier this month announced shutting down its business. The government, on its part, did not publicly say if it had sought an explanation from Buch. She was summoned by Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in October 2024 as part of its review of financial regulators. However, she skipped the meeting citing personal reasons. Despite the controversy, Ms. Buch has built an extraordinary career spanning various top positions at leading companies, most notably at ICICI Bank, ICICI Securities, and ICICI Web Trade Ltd. Her tenure at these institutions played a significant role in shaping India's banking and financial services sector. Born in 1966 and raised in Mumbai, Ms. Buch developed a deep interest in mathematics and finance, which laid the groundwork for her future career.  She pursued an MBA from the prestigious Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad, further strengthening her academic foundation. Ms. Buch's career in the financial sector began in 1989 when she joined ICICI Bank, where her skills and dedication quickly propelled her through the ranks, setting the stage for her remarkable journey in India's corporate world. Over a span of 12 years at ICICI Bank, Ms. Buch served in several key roles such as Head of Marketing and Sales from 1997 to 2002, Head of Product Development from 2002 to 2003 and Head of Operations from 2004 to 2006. In 2006, Ms. Buch was promoted to Executive Director at ICICI Bank, a position she held until 2009, during a transformative period for both the bank and the wider financial industry. After leaving ICICI Bank, Ms. Buch's leadership journey continued with her appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of ICICI Securities in 2009.  During her tenure, she led the firm with distinction until 2011. Following her time at ICICI Securities, Ms. Buch broadened her career horizons with an international role as the Head of Business Development at Greater Pacific Capital in Singapore from 2011 to 2013. She also served as a Non-Executive Director at Idea Cellular from 2011 to 2017, where her expertise guided the company through a rapidly evolving telecommunications landscape. Ms. Buch's influence, however, extends beyond the corporate world. She has held non-executive director roles in several organizations, including Max Healthcare, Zensar Technologies, Innoven Capital, and Gabelhorn Investments. Upon her return to India, Ms. Buch took on non-executive director positions in companies. Her broad and diverse experience led to her appointment as a Whole Time Member (WTM) of Sebi in 2017, where she managed important portfolios such as surveillance and mutual funds. Her close collaboration with then-Sebi Chairperson Ajay Tyagi further solidified her influence within India's regulatory landscape. A defining moment in Buch's life came during the harrowing 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. At the time, she was serving as the Executive Director at ICICI Bank and found herself among a group of corporate leaders trapped in a Mumbai hotel during the tragic event. However, she along with her husband Dhaval Buch, who was then a director at Hindustan Unilever Ltd, came out unscathed from the terror attack.

Relentless foreign fund outflows also made investors jittery. The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex tanked 1,073.48 points to 73,538.95 during the afternoon trade. The NSE Nifty slumped 327.55 points to 22,217.50. From the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Titan, Infosys, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services were the biggest laggards. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Reliance Industries and Adani Ports were the gainers from the pack. In Asian markets, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading with deep cuts. US markets ended sharply lower on Thursday. \u201cStock markets dislike uncertainty, and uncertainty has been on the rise ever since Trump was elected the US president. The spate of tariff announcements by Trump has been impacting markets and the latest announcement of additional 10% tariff on China is a confirmation of the market view that Trump will use the initial months of his presidency to threaten countries with tariffs and then negotiate for a settlement favourable to the United States. \u201cHow China responds to the latest round of tariffs remains to be seen,\u201d V.K.

Forex traders said the ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariff imposition by the U.S. has left financial markets in flux. Moreover, the tariff chaos has injected volatility and uncertainty into the U.S. Dollar Index. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 87.32, then fell to 87.37 against the American currency, registering a decline of 19 paise over its previous close. On Thursday, the rupee settled almost flat with a marginal gain of 1 paisa at 87.18 against U.S. dollar. \"The Indian rupee depreciated by 20 paise influenced by rising geopolitical tensions and the looming threat of trade wars,\" CR Forex Advisors MD Amit Pabari said. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India is actively intervening near the 87.40 level to curb excessive depreciation of the rupee, Pabari said, adding that all eyes are on the upcoming economic data releases, including India's GDP figures. \"The USD/INR pair is expected to remain at elevated levels, with strong support at 87.00 and resistance at 87.50-87.60, amidst rising geopolitical tensions,\" Pabari said. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was at 107.35, higher by 0.10%. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, quoted 0.51% lower at $73.66 per barrel in futures trade. In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex was trading 917.03 points or 1.23% lower at 73,695.40 in morning trade, while Nifty was lower by 272.15 points or 1.21% to 22,272.90. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth \u20b9556.56 crore in the capital markets on net basis on Thursday, according to exchange data. On the global front, President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday, in addition to doubling the 10% universal tariff charged on imports from China. The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil - with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening.

February 27, 2025e-Paper Published - February 28, 2025 03:52 am IST - Washington U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer attend a press conference at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 27, 2025\n                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump held out the prospect of a \u201cgreat\u201d post-Brexit trade deal that could avoid tariffs on Britain on Thursday (February 27, 2025) \u2014 as he hailed Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a tough negotiator. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great trade agreement, one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during a joint press conference with Mr. Starmer at the White House, adding that a new deal could come together \u201crather quickly.\u201d Pro-Brexit politicians dangled the promise of a U.S.-U.K. trade deal as one of the benefits of leaving the European Union ahead of the 2016 referendum on EU membership. But they failed to agree a deal following the vote. Billionaire property tycoon Mr. Trump, who authored a book called the \u201cArt of the Deal,\u201d hailed former human rights lawyer Starmer\u2019s negotiating skills during the press conference. \u201cYou\u2019re a very tough negotiator \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I like that, but that\u2019s ok,\u201d Mr. Trump joked. Asked if Mr. Starmer had managed to persuade him to drop the threat of tariffs, the U.S. President chuckled and said: \u201cHe tried. he was working hard, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d \u201cHe earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\u201d he added. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs against trading partners with whom the United States has a large trade deficit, including the European Union and China. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on a deal signal that his administration is keen to revive the trade talks with Britain, which made little progress during his predecessor Joe Biden\u2019s term in office. Mr. Starmer said he had had a \u201cproductive discussion\u201d with Mr. Trump, adding that the United States and Britain were now working on a new \u201ceconomic deal.\u201d \u201cWe could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that the eventual deal could be \u201creally terrific for both countries.\u201d On Thursday (February 27, 2025), Mr. Starmer defended Britain\u2019s trade balance with the United States, calling it \u201cfair, balanced and reciprocal.\u201d Published - February 28, 2025 03:52 am IST United Kingdom\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        business (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        trade agreements Copyright\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Following this, the BBMP issued notices demanding payment of dues for the period between 2022-23 and 2026-27, amounting to \u20b965.93 lakh. Despite two prior notices, IKEA did not respond. Subsequently, a third notice was issued on February 20, 2025. Responding to the notice, IKEA cleared the dues on February 25 by submitting a demand draft in favor of the BBMP Chief Commissioner, Tushar Giri Nath. In a statement, the company said: \u201cIKEA complies with the law of the land. We have paid this money under protest to meet the BBMP deadlines.

February 27, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 27, 2025 04:06 pm IST - NEW YORK Going into the year investors were betting that President Donald Trump's policies would spur U.S. stocks and the dollar to outperform their global peers. That assumption is increasingly getting tested. The Trump administration's revamp of the government and massive moves on trade and other policies have instead injected uncertainty, with consumers and businesses worrying about the economy, threatening the narrative of U.S. exceptionalism. The policy uncertainty is \"leading to a dynamic ... where you start to see investors and business leaders and consumers alike kind of reining things in a little bit,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. \"That's against the backdrop that, aside from all the policy and the Trump administration noise, was already on a cooling trajectory\" for the U.S. economy, he added. In addition, the country's megacap tech and growth companies that drove much of the market's gains in recent years have faltered on valuation concerns and fed by worries over the DeepSeek low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model. One ETF tracking the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" group has fallen more than 10% from its high in mid-December. Nvidia, a critical member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group, forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates on Wednesday, while the semiconductor company's margin outlook was slightly lower than expected, in a report that was primed to set the tone for markets on Thursday. Heading into 2025, U.S. equities and the dollar were widely expected to outstrip their foreign counterparts. So far this year, however, the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 has risen just over 1% against a roughly 7% climb for an MSCI index of stocks in over 40 other countries, while the greenback has slid about 3% from its January peak against a basket of its main rivals. Some of the diverging performance stems from developments outside the U.S., including surprising economic data in Europe and the emergence of an AI model in China that has shaken the technology sector, which has an outsized presence in U.S. stock indexes. However, worries about the domestic growth outlook have heightened after recent weak indicators from consumers and businesses, amid a barrage of announcements regarding trade and federal workforce cuts from the Trump administration, compounding concerns about the impact of still-firm inflation on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. The latest economic reports could help drive a long-awaited catch-up for international assets, which have grown increasingly cheap compared with their U.S. rivals. For example, on a price-to-earnings basis, the S&P 500's premium over the MSCI index of stocks outside the U.S. reached its highest in more than two decades in late 2024, according to LSEG Datastream. Among the worrisome signs in the U.S. economy over the past week are a release on Tuesday showing consumer confidence falling at its sharpest pace in 3-1/2 years in February, and a separate reading that showed consumer sentiment dropping to a 15-month low. A survey on Friday showed business activity sank to a 17-month low, with activity nearly stalling in February. \u201cThe expectation has been for the U.S. (economy) to continue to do very well,\u201d said Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, who at the start of the year tilted a global equities portfolio more toward stocks outside of the U.S. \"So if there is some fault with that, then maybe some of the valuation excess that the U.S. has needs to come down closer to where the rest of the world is.\u201d Recent weakness in U.S. economic data has spurred investors to ascribe incrementally higher probability to a \"growth scare\" scenario, Charlie McElligott, managing director of cross-asset strategy at Nomura, said in a note on Monday. Investors seem to be \"getting their arms around\" the implications of the initial Trump administration policies and starting to account for a far more serious growth drag than initial post-election narratives had suggested, he said. Other indicators also may reflect a cloudier corporate outlook. The National Federation of Independent Business's survey for January found the percentage of its small business members planning capital expenditures within the next six months dropping to the lowest level since before the November election. The value and total number of announced U.S. deals fell by about a third over roughly the first two months of 2025 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Dealogic, even as the administration has been expected to provide a friendlier regulatory environment for mergers and acquisitions. \"Another month or two of poor U.S. economic data would deliver a blow to the U.S. exceptionalism narrative\" and be a downside risk for the dollar, strategists at BBH said in a note on Tuesday. European stocks generally have surged to start the year, with the continent-wide STOXX 600 index rising 10% so far in 2025. Recent corporate profit growth in Europe is exceeding expectations by a greater extent than it is in the U.S., said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments. His firm has been \"aggressively overweight\" U.S. equities for most of the last 15 years, but in the near term, has moved more heavily to European shares, Rosen said. \"There's just more evidence that the very strong economic performance that we've seen in the U.S. is beginning to diminish a bit,\" Rosen said. Indeed, the U.S. exceptionalism trade was \"too crowded\" following the election, said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer with Truist Advisory Services, paving the way for at least some reversal to start the year. Despite the shakier start for U.S. assets, many investors may not abandon the trade. While the U.S. economy was showing signs of weakness, many investors said risks of a near-term recession remained low while the economic benefits from Trump's policies could come later in the year. If the U.S. economy does struggle, at some point the weakness would likely spread elsewhere, investors said. \"If the U.S. catches a cold, the rest of the world is going to get the flu,\" Mr. Nolte said. The Magnificent Seven companies have business models that many investors say can weather economic weakness better than other industries, which could support the U.S. market in a global slowdown. The Magnificent Seven \"stocks are not cheap... but their leadership is not in question,\" said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic.

February 27, 2025e-Paper Published - February 27, 2025 03:56 pm IST - LONDON Big investors are sensing that a fresh joint European borrowing effort is becoming more likely as the region scrambles to ramp up defence spending. The modest reaction across bond markets, typically unnerved by higher spending, as defence talks gathered pace this month suggests investors view increased borrowing as manageable so far. They say it also suggests markets expect some form of joint European funding again, five years after the European Union launched an 800 billion euro ($840 billion) pandemic recovery fund. Late last year investors saw joint borrowing from the EU itself as less likely. But the need for action has re-emerged as U.S.-Russia talks to end the Ukraine war sideline Europe and pile pressure on a bloc already urged to up spending by U.S. President Donald Trump. The EU believes 500 billion euros of investments are needed over the next decade. But raising defence spending to 3% of output would require nearly 200 billion euros per year more. Germany's 10-year yield rose less than 10 basis points after Mr. Trump started talks with Russia but has since reversed that move. The additional yields Italy and Spain, which spend much less than 2% of their output on defence, pay over Germany's debt have barely moved. \"The knee jerk (reaction) is that governments start spending some extra, but it won't be huge amounts,\" said David Zahn, Franklin Templeton's head of European fixed income. \"The bigger amounts will have to come from some type of centralized funding, because most budgets in Europe are relatively stretched,\" he added, particularly in Italy and France. He has sold EU bonds expecting more joint issuance, while Vanguard is sticking to a bet on Italian and Spanish bonds. \"If they (policymakers) are serious about it, then there comes a point where we're going to have to think about issuance of joint defence bonds,\" said AXA Investment Managers fund manager Nicolas Trindade. \"That's where you have the most capacity.\" Some analysts reckon even Germany, which will face a huge spending shortfall unless it agrees a new defence fund, may benefit from joint borrowing it has so far opposed. Germany is seeking potentially hundreds of billions of euros for defence spending before a new parliament potentially blocks the move. Matter of time Whether it's a new funding vehicle that includes Britain or more EU bonds--the most welcome outcome for investors, making the bloc a more permanent borrower--a joint solution is expected, albeit not immediately. First, the bloc is looking at temporarily exempting defence spending from its budget deficit rules. It could then shift roughly 90 billion euros of unused loans to defence from its recovery fund. So further joint borrowing may not come until 2027, said Carmignac economist Apolline Menut, adding German efforts to find a fast national solution may also reduce the urgency. The question is how much extra borrowing investors will tolerate when they're already buying record amounts of euro zone debt and are uneasy about high deficits in big economies. Investors say it's hard to judge without knowing how much money is needed and over what time horizon. Britain aims to raise spending gradually over several years. One clear reaction has been in Germany, where longer-term borrowing costs exceeded shorter-term ones by the most since 2022 this month, suggesting more bond sales are anticipated. Asset managers including AXA, Allianz Global Investors and Northern Trust say higher defence spending supports steeper yield curves. Yet Germany's 10-year yield, around 2.5%, is nearly 2 percentage points lower than in the U.S. Even Italy's is 80 basis points less. \"Yields are quite reasonable in Europe at the moment. I don't see it as a major constraint,\" said Franklin Templeton's Zahn. German yields have remained largely unchanged since 2023, when the European Central Bank halted rate hikes, Citi notes. The amount of debt investors need to buy has only increased since then. It still believes yields could eventually fall below 2% as tighter financing conditions prompt more rate cuts. Bond investors also want to see if defence spending lifts euro zone growth, making debt levels more sustainable. Goldman Sachs senior European economist Filippo Taddei reckons every euro of extra defence spending would boost output by just 40 cents initially. The impact could be much bigger if it boosts industry and raises productivity. \"It's obviously unclear ... but the market is pricing a decent probability that that could happen,\" Mr. Taddei said.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash - From record highs to a five-month slide: Where are Sensex, Nifty headed? - India Today",
        "text": "Listen to Story The wild ride on Dalal Street has left investors feeling like they've been through a financial whiplash. Just months ago, in September, the Sensex soared to dizzying heights of nearly 86,000 and the Nifty sprinted past 26,200. Market pundits were practically falling over themselves to predict even greater peaks\u2014the Sensex hitting 90,000 and the Nifty touching 30,000 seemed just around the corner. Many folks jumped in, their investment decisions fuelled by these rosy forecasts and the fear of missing out. But fast-forward to today, and the same markets that had investors popping champagne bottles are now causing sleepless nights. The stock markets are experiencing their worst losing streak in nearly three decades. Global economic worries, foreign investors pulling out their money, and disappointing company results have created a perfect storm. February closed with another month in the red\u2014that's five consecutive months of losses, something that has not happened since 1996. Last Friday was particularly brutal, with the Sensex plummeting over 1,400 points to land at 73,198, while the Nifty tumbled 420 points to 22,124. That's eight straight sessions of Nifty seeing red. In plain terms, about Rs 9 lakh crore of investor wealth simply evaporated in a single day's trading. The tumble from the top has been nothing short of painful. Since touching its record high of 85,978 back in September, the Sensex has shed a whopping 15%\u2014that's 12,780 points gone. Nifty's story is even more sobering, down nearly 16% from its all-time peak of 26,277. The February decline alone saw the Sensex and Nifty plummet by nearly 6%. WHAT'S BEHIND THE BLOODBATH? \u201cInvestor sentiment has taken a hit due to escalating trade tariff concerns and unfavourable global cues,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. \u201cThe IT sector has borne the brunt, as fears of a U.S. slowdown and deal deferrals weigh on the industry. Small and mid-cap stocks, already struggling with valuation concerns, have also taken a beating.\u201d Adding to the pessimism, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have continued to pull money out of Indian equities. On Thursday alone, FIIs sold stocks worth Rs 556.56 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought Rs 1,727 crore worth of shares, according to NSE data. Technical analysts are cautious about the road ahead. \u201cNifty is approaching the crucial support zone of 21,800-22,000. A sustained move above 21,800 could trigger a rebound, but failure to hold this level may lead to another sharp decline,\u201d said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking, advised traders to remain cautious. \u201cGiven the prevailing weakness, it\u2019s best to manage leverage carefully and prioritize hedged trades. A clear sign of reversal is still lacking,\u201d he noted.LONGEST LOSING STREAK IN 29 YEARS The last time Nifty posted five straight months of losses was between July and November 1996. The longest losing streak on record was an eight-month slide from September 1994 to April 1995. While historical data doesn\u2019t dictate future performance, these periods serve as a reference for how prolonged corrections can unfold. A key driver of the current decline is the shift in global sentiment. \u201cWith declining US bond yields signaling a flight to safe-haven assets, FII flows are moving to cheaper markets,\u201d Nair explained. \u201cThe ongoing tariff war is another major headwind that could further impact market sentiment.\u201d Despite the weakness, some see hope for a relief rally. \u201cWe are close to market capitulation, and oversold conditions could trigger a short-term rebound next week,\u201d said Satish Chandra Aluri of Lemonn Markets Desk. \u201cHowever, overall, we expect volatility with a downward bias in the near term.\u201dadvertisementWILL POOR RUN CONTINUE?\u201cMarkets are in a phase of derating, and there\u2019s no clear signal of reversal yet,\u201d analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities noted. \u201cDespite the correction, valuations remain unattractive, making it hard to find compelling investment opportunities.\u201dAditya Gaggar, Director at Progressive Shares, pointed to key technical levels. \u201cNifty50 has broken a four-year-long trendline support, suggesting further downside. The next key support level is 21,800, while any rebound could face resistance at 22,450-22,500,\u201d he said.Bank Nifty has fared slightly better but remains vulnerable. \u201cIf it falls below 47,900, we could see further downside to 47,350. The immediate resistance stands at 48,900,\u201d Gaggar added.Meanwhile, India\u2019s Q3 FY25 GDP data, released yesterday, met expectations with an upward revision to 6.5% growth for the fiscal year. \u201cThe agriculture sector has posted steady growth, which could boost rural consumption. This will be a key factor in determining how markets recover,\u201d Vinod Nair said.For now, investors are bracing for continued volatility. With Q4 earnings, global economic data, and trade policy developments in focus, the coming months could see sharp swings in market direction.While technical indicators hint at possible support, a definitive turnaround remains elusive. Until then, caution remains the dominant theme on Dalal Street.(Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group.

        "text": "Business Insider Edition The latest figures for Kenya\u2019s inflation depict another increase, extending an upward trajectory that began in November last year. In comparison to August, Kenya's inflation rate decreased from 4.4% to 3.6% in September. Subsequently, the consumer price index eased to 2.7% in October 2024. Since then, the country's inflation rate has been on a steady increase. For February, Kenya\u2019s inflation rate rose to 3.5% from 3.3% in January. This information was detailed in an email issued on Friday by the Kenyan National Bureau of Statistics, as seen on Bloomberg. The 2% core inflation rate, which excludes energy and the cost of volatile agricultural staples, showed weak demand. Last year, in February, the country\u2019s inflation hit a 23-month low of 6.3%. By March, the country\u2019s inflation had fallen even further from the figure recorded in February to 5.7%. In April, the inflation rate fell to 5.0%, and in May, the country's inflation maintained the 5.0% level before declining sharply to 4.6% in June. Since June, Kenya has managed to keep its inflation rate below the 5% mark the Central Bank had placed as a target range. This was a huge win, considering that Kenya\u2019s inflation rate hit an all-time high of 9.2 in 2023. Additionally, for the fourth consecutive meeting, Kenya's central bank lowered its main interest rate to 10.75% on February 5 and announced plans to take more action to encourage lending and accelerate economic expansion. \u201cPrices of food and non-alcoholic drinks \u2013 which make up a third of the inflation basket \u2013 rose 6.4% in February from 6.1% a month earlier. Transport costs rose 0.7%, similar to January, after the nation left gasoline prices unchanged during the mid-month review,\u201d the Bloomberg report details. \u201cA drop in global fuel prices bodes well for Kenya, which imports refined petroleum products, and may ease energy prices. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel prices fell 0.8% in February from -1.6% a month earlier,\u201d it adds. In November, Kenya\u2019s inflation rate rose to 2.8% from 2.7% the month prior. In December, the country\u2019s inflation rate went up again, reaching 3%.

        "text": "Business Insider Edition Food inflation continues to be a significant issue for some African countries, compounding economic hardship and increasing food insecurity for millions. With many African nations already dealing with structural issues, the significant rise in food costs jeopardizes not just household welfare but also overall economic stability. Food security remains alarmingly low in most low-income nations, notably in Africa, where an estimated 61.6 million people are food insecure, as seen in the World Bank's latest Food Security Update. The report also mentions that over 50 million more are expected in Western and Central Africa. Two of the primary culprits for this issue are conflicts and climate change. SEE ALSO: 10 African countries with the highest food inflation in mid-2024 \u201cSince the last update, agricultural and export price indices have risen, closing at 3 percent and 6 percent higher, respectively,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe cereal price index closed at the same level \u2022 Domestic food price inflation remains high in most low-income countries,\u201d it adds. Food price inflation data from the most recent month between October 2024 and January 2025 shows high inflation in many low- and middle-income countries, with inflation higher than 5% in 73.7 percent of low-income countries (1.5 percentage points higher since the last update on January 14, 2025), 52.2 percent of lower-middle-income countries (8.7 percentage points higher), 38.0 percent of upper-middle-income countries (no change). In real terms, food price inflation topped overall inflation (defined as year-on-year change in the overall CPI) in 56 percent of the 164 countries where both food CPI and overall CPI indexes are available.

        "text": "Business Insider Edition Even though one-third of African nations are landlocked, seaports remain essential for economic activity, connecting businesses to international markets. Africa relies heavily on maritime transport to facilitate trade, serving as a key gateway to the global economy. Despite accounting for only 2.7% of global trade by value, the continent contributes 7% of global maritime exports and 5% of maritime imports by volume. Even though one-third of African nations are landlocked, seaports remain essential for economic activity, connecting businesses to international markets. DON'T MISS THIS: The best and worst African airports ranked globally Over the years, Africa\u2019s port capacity has expanded significantly. According to the African Development Bank, container traffic in African ports surged by nearly 50% between 2011 and 2021, rising from 24.5 million to 35.8 million container units. This growth has been fueled by investments in trade terminals, specialized facilities that handle specific types of cargo, such as containers, oil, and bulk commodities. These terminals play a crucial role in improving logistics efficiency by streamlining the loading, unloading, and storage of goods before distribution. DON'T MISS THIS: Top 10 airlines in Africa with the best staff service in 2024 However, despite their growing importance, many African ports still struggle with infrastructure deficits that limit their full potential. Issues such as outdated equipment, a lack of deepwater berths, and inefficient cargo-handling facilities often lead to congestion and costly delays. Poor road and rail connectivity further compounds the problem, making inland transportation slow and expensive. Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

        "text": "Business Insider Edition Africa gains from having a strong currency in many ways, such as commerce, investment, regional integration, and geopolitical influence, much like the rest of the globe. In contrast, these are affected when a country\u2019s currency has little strength. African nations with weak currencies in contrast to the dollar confront substantial economic challenges ranging from rising inflation and decreased buying power to diminishing investor confidence and adverse trade circumstances. When a currency is weak, it leads to an unstable investment climate. Domestic and international investors are afraid of nations with volatile currencies since the danger of unanticipated currency depreciation might reduce earnings and capital investments. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is less likely to flow into nations with weak or volatile currencies since investors prefer markets with more security and long-term development prospects. Furthermore, firms operating in such contexts have unexpected operational costs, making it difficult to plan growth projects efficiently. African countries with weak currencies frequently have to pay more for imported commodities and have a harder time negotiating advantageous trade agreements. This shortcoming makes it more difficult for companies to purchase cutting-edge equipment, raw materials, and technology at competitive costs, which lowers industrial output. DON'T MISS THIS: Top 10 African countries with the strongest currencies in February 2025 Furthermore, a weak currency reduces a nation's ability to negotiate in regional trade blocs like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which lowers the competitiveness of exports and impedes attempts at economic integration. In the end, one of the worst consequences of having a weak currency is excessive inflation. Food, gasoline, and technology are among the necessities that many African countries mostly import. Consumer prices for products and services rise as a result of rising import costs brought on by a declining currency. While several African countries boast some of the world\u2019s best-performing currencies it also has some of the worst, predominantly in nations struggling with economic instability. With that said, here are the weakest currencies currently according to the Forbes currency converter, last updated on 26th of February 2025.

        "text": "Business Insider Edition Nigerian officials have discovered USAID-funded medications being sold in local markets. The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), a Nigerian regulatory agency has discovered USAID-funded medications and other expired drugs during a raid in Lagos State, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub. The agency seized 87 truckloads of banned, expired, and substandard medicinal products, including USAID- and UNFPA-donated antiretroviral drugs, male and female condoms, among others. DON'T MISS THIS: 28,000 stranded USAID staff in Nigeria receive government backing According to NAFDAC\u2019s Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, the operation exposed serious violations of drug storage and distribution regulations. Adeyeye warned that these life-saving medications were either improperly stored or deliberately resold, undermining global efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. Following the 90-day halt on most foreign aid by US President Donald Trump, and the subsequent shutdown of USAID activities, many countries have initiated moves to cover the gap created by USAID's exit. USAID funding plays a crucial role in Nigeria's HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child care, and disease prevention efforts. In 2023, the nation received $1.02 billion in funding, largely through agencies like USAID. About 31 countries, mostly in Asia, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa, relied on the US for at least one-fourth of their total foreign aid. In response to USAID's shutdown, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council approved $1 billion for healthcare sector reforms and allocated an additional $3.2 million to procure 150,000 HIV treatment packs over the next four months. The discovery of USAID-funded medications in Nigerian markets raises concerns about oversight and accountability but does not necessarily confirm USAID failed its mandate. The Trump administration has accused USAID of wastage and failing to adhere to its original mandate. Possible causes include weak supply chain monitoring, corruption, and diversion of expired or overstocked drugs. While USAID provides medical aid, local agencies are responsible for distribution, and enforcement gaps can lead to misuse. This highlights broader challenges in aid management, requiring stricter monitoring by both donors and local authorities to prevent future lapses. The Punch reports that among the seized products were large quantities of donated antiretroviral drugs and expired male and female condoms from USAID and UNFPA. Pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and prescription-only medicines, were found stored in poor conditions, exposed to high temperatures without proper cold storage. \u201cThe issue is not just the authenticity of the products but also their storage conditions. Items requiring temperatures of -8\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C were found in unsafe environments,\u201d the NAFDAC DG, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye noted. DON'T MISS THIS: USAID shutdown triggers crisis for NGOs, healthcare workers across Africa Among the discoveries were large quantities of controlled substances, including TAFRADOL (recently banned in India after a BBC expos\u00e9 on illicit drug exports to Africa), Tramadol, Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), Nitrazepam, and Diazepam. The estimated value of the seized drugs is N1 trillion. \u201cThe volume of narcotics and controlled drugs seized is enough to destabilize national security,\u201d Adeyeye warned, adding that banned, unregistered, and expired products were also found hidden in plumbing and wood plank sections of the Head Bridge market.

        "text": "With today marking the final deadline for spaza shops and other food-handling outlets to register their businesses with local municipalities, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS) has confirmed that no extension will be granted. Spaza shop owners and vendors have until the end of the day to complete their registration, after which unregistered businesses may face penalties. \"Following several engagements within the IMC [Inter-Ministerial Committee] and in consultation with the President, a decision has been taken not to extend the deadline of the 28th February 2025, as ample time was given to business owners to comply with the Presidential directive,\" NATJOINTS said on Friday. Meanwhile, the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on foodborne illnesses and illicit goods expressed satisfaction with the progress made in implementing government interventions ahead of today's deadline. On November 15, 2024, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 21-day period for the registration of food handling business. This was extended on 18 December 2024 to 28 February 2025. The intervention follows a serious incident involving foodborne illnesses, which resulted in over 890 cases and nearly 30 deaths since September 2024. In October last year, six primary school children from Naledi, Soweto, died after allegedly eating snacks from a foreign-owned local spaza shop. The NATJOINTS statement stated that the Ministers of Health and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Aaron Motsoaledi and Velenkosini Hlabisa, as the co-Chairs of the IMC said that valuable lessons were learnt during this period. This is especially regarding the need for strengthened enforcement of regulation of the spaza shops and other food handling outlets. The IMC has overseen the implementation of the action plan by the multi-disciplinary teams at the NATJOINTS drawn from the commitments made by the President. \"It is important to emphasise that the work of multi-disciplinary teams under the NATJOINTS will continue beyond this deadline. Enforcement of the law is not an event, and we are committed to continuing the work to formalise, regularise the sector and compliance with the law,\" said the NATJOINTS. This includes warehouses and other establishments that unlawfully stock hazardous chemicals, banned substances, and pesticides. \"We have strengthened our capacity and systems to monitor and database this sector. This will enhance our ability to support and encourage their growth and formalisation, while at the same time ensuring adherence to business registration and food safety laws including municipal by-laws.\" Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

READ | Last day to register spaza shops To obtain a licence or permit to trade, business owners must comply with all health regulations and municipal by-laws related to conducting business. Where business owners are found to be non-compliant, the law will be enforced and this includes fines, arrests, and closures as applicable. \"We want to emphasise that our cardinal aim is to help businesses to comply with the law and to ensure the safety of our citizens and children.

        "title": "Kenya's Inflation Up to 3.5pc in Feb On High Food, Transport Costs - allAfrica.com",
        "text": "NAIROBI \u2014 Kenya's monthly inflation rate rose to 3.5 percent in February 2025, up from 3.3 percent recorded in January, according to the latest report from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The surge in inflation was largely driven by rising prices in the Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages category, which recorded a 6.4 percent increase, and the transport sector, which saw a 0.7 percent rise over the same period. \"The annual consumer price inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 3.5 per cent in February 2025, up from 3.3 per cent in January 2025. This is an indication that the general price level in February 2025 was 3.5 per cent higher than it was in February 2024,\" stated KNBS. The KNBS report indicated that the Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Other Fuels' Index rose by 0.1 percent between January and February 2025. \"The increase was attributable to an increase in the price of gas/LPG by 0.6 per cent between January 2025 and February 2025. Prices of 50kWh electricity and 200 kWh electricity however, declined by 1.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively in the same period,\" it noted. The Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages Index increased by 0.6 percent between January 2025 and February 2025. Notably, prices of sugar, cooking oil (salad), and tomatoes also increased by 3.2, 1.6, and 1.3 percent, respectively. On the other hand, prices of wheat flour (white) and potatoes (Irish) dropped by 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. Read the original article on Capital FM.

        "title": "Uganda: Tomatoes, Fresh Leaf Vegetables Lead Monthly Inflation Surge in Uganda - allAfrica.com",
        "text": "Monthly headline inflation for February 2025 surged by 0.6%, more than doubling the 0.3% recorded in January 2025. The cost of living in Uganda has experienced a notable rise, with tomatoes and fresh leaf vegetables emerging as the primary contributors to monthly inflation, according to the latest data from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Monthly headline inflation for February 2025 surged by 0.6%, more than doubling the 0.3% recorded in January 2025. UBOS data, released on February 28, 2025, revealed a significant spike in the prices of tomatoes, which jumped from 4.7% in January to 12.4% in February. Similarly, the price of fresh leaf vegetables increased from 8.9% in January to 11.9% in February. Other key contributors to the inflationary pressures included fresh cassava, which saw prices rise from 2.5% in January to 4.1% in February, and dry beans, which climbed from 0.4% in January to 2.8% in February. Fish prices also remained high, with fresh tilapia increasing from 9.6% in January to 15.7% in February. In actual market prices, a kilogramme of tomatoes that cost Shs2,576 in January is now selling for Shs2,813. Green pepper prices have seen a substantial increase, from Shs2,267 per kilogram in January to Shs3,261 in February. Fresh tilapia, previously priced at Shs16,098 per kilogramme, now costs Shs17,231. Explaining the price hikes, Samuel Echoku, a microeconomic statistician at UBOS, attributed the fluctuations to market dynamics. \"All is determined by demand and supply, and most of these products are seasonal,\" he said. Seasonal shortages, especially during the dry season when production tends to slow, have contributed to the rising prices of perishables. Traders and farmers have reported reduced harvests due to unfavorable weather conditions, further exacerbating the strain on supply. In addition to the monthly price surges, annual headline inflation for the year ending February 2025 slightly increased to 3.7% from 3.6% in January 2025. However, annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food prices, slowed from 4.2% in January to 3.9% in February. \"The headline inflation includes both perishables and non-perishables, while core inflation focuses on items less affected by weather changes,\" Echoku explained. \"Even in drawing policy, core inflation is considered since it does not change as quickly as headline inflation.\" Despite the ongoing inflationary pressures, UBOS data revealed slight decreases in passenger transport costs by road and education services. However, price increases were reported for rice, maize flour, sugar, matooke, fresh cassava, tomatoes, beans, and green pepper. Firewood prices, however, have declined.

The consistent rise in food prices has raised concerns, especially for low-income households, as essential commodities become increasingly unaffordable. Economists predict that unless agricultural production stabilizes, food inflation could remain a persistent challenge in the coming months. According to UBOS, policymakers and industry stakeholders will continue to monitor these trends to assess their economic impact and consider interventions to stabilize prices. Meanwhile, consumers are encouraged to explore alternative food options and adopt cost-saving measures in response to the rising costs of staple foods. Read the original article on Nile Post.

        "title": "Malawi Government Unveils K8.05 Trillion Budget - a Deep Dive Into the 2025/2026 Financial Plan - allAfrica.com",
        "text": "Government has unveiled an ambitious K8.05 trillion national budget for the 2025/2026 financial year, with a focus on economic stabilization, social protection, and infrastructure development. Delivered by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Honourable Simplex Chithyola Banda, the budget represents 31.1 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and signals the government's strategy to consolidate economic gains and foster resilience amid global and domestic economic challenges. Debt and Fiscal Realities The budget comes at a time when Malawi's public debt stock stands at K16.19 trillion, representing 86.4 percent of GDP. Of this, K7.39 trillion is external debt while K8.79 trillion is domestic debt. To address this, the government has committed to fiscal consolidation, debt restructuring, and enhanced domestic revenue mobilization. Interest payments alone are projected at K2.17 trillion, nearly half of the estimated domestic revenue, posing a significant strain on the country's fiscal space. The government has acknowledged that a large portion of the budget will be directed towards servicing past debts, wages, and pensions, leaving limited resources for development projects. Key Allocations The 2025/2026 budget prioritizes Agriculture, Health, Education, Infrastructure Development, and Social Protection, reflecting the government's ambition to promote economic diversification and social welfare. Education and Skills Development receives the largest sectoral allocation at K1.3 trillion (16.6% of the total budget) to finance classroom construction, university infrastructure, student loans, and curriculum reforms. Health and Population Sector follows with K741.05 billion (9.2%), covering hospital construction, health posts, and the completion of the National Cancer Centre. The Agriculture Sector is allocated K693.3 billion (9%), including K131.6 billion for the Affordable Inputs Programme (AIP), K99.5 billion for Irrigation Development, and K38.3 billion for Mega Farms projects. Infrastructure development across Transport and Public Works has been allocated K422.3 billion, supporting key projects such as the Marka-Bangula railway line, road upgrades, and the modernization of Kamuzu International Airport. Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) is allocated K162.9 billion to prepare for the 2025 Tripartite Elections, marking a 207 percent increase from the previous year. Economic Growth and Production The government anticipates a 3.4 percent GDP growth rate in 2025, driven by increased investments in agriculture, tourism, mining, and manufacturing - the cornerstones of the Agriculture, Tourism, Mining, and Manufacturing (ATMM) strategy. Key investments include: Irrigation Development aimed at stabilizing maize yields and mitigating the impact of climate change. The expansion of Mega Farms to boost agricultural exports and ensure food security. The operationalization of the Malawi Mining Investment Company to formalize gold mining and curb illegal mineral exports. Increased funding for Tourism Promotion and Development to market Malawi internationally and boost foreign exchange earnings. Social Protection and Inclusion The government has reaffirmed its commitment to social welfare with allocations such as: K42.5 billion under the Constituency Development Fund, translating to K220 million per constituency. K33.5 billion for drug procurement in local councils. K188.5 billion under the Malawi Social Support for Resilient Livelihoods Programme. The Social Cash Transfer Programme targeting 382,457 vulnerable households. Challenges and Risks While the budget outlines ambitious targets, concerns linger over the rising public debt, inflation projected at 22.3 percent, and the heavy reliance on domestic borrowing to finance the deficit. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated at K2.47 trillion (9.5% of GDP), with K2.33 trillion expected to be borrowed from domestic markets.

Additionally, the government's ability to mobilize external grants, which are projected at K1.14 trillion, will be critical in cushioning the deficit. Conclusion The 2025/2026 Malawi budget sets out a bold vision to stimulate economic recovery and promote social inclusion through strategic investments in productive sectors. However, the success of this budget will largely depend on the government's capacity to implement structural reforms, curb speculative market activities, and enhance domestic revenue mobilization. With mounting debt pressures and limited fiscal space, the government's ambitious agenda will require unwavering commitment to prudent public finance management, transparent governance, and citizen participation in the economic transformation journey.

        "title": "Nigerians Displaced As Rents Double in Inflation-Hit Lagos - allAfrica.com",
        "text": "Nigeria's economic crisis is hitting renters in Lagos hard as landlords pass down the costs of spiralling inflation -- pushing residents further out, upending children's education and adding to workers' already infamous commutes. With a population of more than 20 million, the country's sprawling, ever-growing economic capital has for years struggled to keep up with housing demand, with some 3,000 people added to its population per day. But government-led economic reforms, including the floating of the naira currency and the removal of a fuel subsidy, have sent a shock through the economy. In a city that scions of oil wealth, a solid middle class and millions of informal workers all call home, rents are spiking on both Lagos' richer islands and the cheaper -- and poorer -- mainland. \"I might just have to find a way to plead with my landlord,\" said Yemisi Odusanya, a 40-year-old cookbook author and food blogger. After giving birth to twins last year, she's doubtful she can find a better deal elsewhere for her family of seven, even after her landlord in Lekki raised the rent 120 percent. \"I'm planning to pack out,\" Bartholomew Idowu, a transportation worker, said emphatically, though he wasn't sure where he and his children would move. The mainland resident's landlord hit him with a 28-percent rent increase, from 350,000 naira ($232) per year to 450,000 -- a significant sum in a country where the GDP per capita is $835. - Children changing schools - The government recently revised its inflation data, knocking down official year-on-year inflation in January to 24.48 percent, from December's 34.80 percent figure. That's been of little consolation to ordinary Nigerians. \"The way out at the moment is to look for a way to pay,\" said Dennis Erezi, a journalist, noting that his 31-percent rent increase is still cheaper than moving. Jimoh Saheed, a personal trainer, had to leave his one-room flat in a middle-class neighbourhood in Ikoyi when his landlord more than doubled his rent to 2.5 million naira a year and a half ago. Moving to the mainland meant he was further from his clients and his two children had to change schools and now pay for transport since they no longer live close enough to walk to class. Late last year, his new landlord raised his rent by 25 percent. \"This is affecting me emotionally, it's affecting me mentally, and in fact, physically,\" said the 39-year-old, who said his earnings have not kept up with the pace of inflation despite taking on more work. Lawyers say that rent hikes cannot be unilaterally imposed and are supposed to be negotiated between parties. But laws are rarely enforced without the threat of a lawsuit, attorney Valerian Nwadike told AFP, noting an uptick in tenant-landlord disputes in the past year. - Luxury market - The government hopes its economic reforms will eventually pay dividends, but for nearly two years Nigerians have slogged through the worst economic crisis in a generation. There are also structural issues at play: high interest rates mean mortgages are out of reach for most, and developers face a bureaucratic regulatory environment, said housing analyst Babatunde Akinpelu. Lagos is also home to an outsize number of Nigeria's jobs -- leading to an unending stream of people pouring in. Even as cranes and construction sites whir across the city, many new developments are targeted to the high-end market -- foreigners, Nigerians in the diaspora or oil sector workers, many of whom earn in dollars. The result is a bifurcated housing market, where increased supply in the luxury sector doesn't trickle down to the rest of the housing stock, said economist Steve Onyeiwu. \"Most of (Lagos's) landlords are exposed to dollar-denominated expenses,\" like loans or mortgages for properties abroad, even as the naira's value has collapsed, said a director at Island Shoreline, a property management company, adding his own landlord recently tried to raise his rent 100 percent.

Improved public transit, such as the new rail line connecting Lagos and Ibadan, might alleviate pressure but for now there's a \"snowball effect\" of rising prices, he noted, asking that his name not be used given the sensitivity of rent hikes. With leases typically paid up front for anywhere between one and three years, both landlords and renters try to negotiate a good deal to hedge against inflation. But the current spike in rents is \"alarming,\" said real-estate agent Ismail Oriyomi Akinola, noting 200 percent jumps on the wealthy Victoria Island. \"Good shelter is very key to every individual,\" he said. \"Not only for the rich.\" Read the original article on Vanguard.
