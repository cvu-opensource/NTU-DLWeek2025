        "title": "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds quits over aid cuts",
        "text": "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\". She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\". The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning. She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\". Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending. In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\". He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\" In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \"come crashing down\". She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance]. However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\". She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\". \"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\" The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income. The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support. He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move. Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister. But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\". Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds. Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers. In a post on X, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I disagree with the PM on many things but on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He's absolutely right. \"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\" However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added. Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Monica Harding said Dodds had \"done the right thing\" describing the government's position as \"unsustainable. She said it was right to increase defence spending but added that \"doing so by cutting the international aid budget is like robbing Peter to pay Paul\". \"Where we withdraw our aid, it's Russia and China who will fill the vacuum.\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation. \"It is a really difficult decision that was made but it was absolutely right the PM and cabinet endorse the PM's actions to spend more money on defence,\" she said. Dodds first became a Labour MP in 2017 when she was elected to represent the Oxford East constituency. Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over. Following Labour's poor performance in the 2021 local elections, she was demoted to the women and equalities brief. Since July 2024, she has served as international development minister. Dodds becomes the fourth minister to leave Starmer's government, following Louise Haigh, Tulip Siddiq and Andrew Gwynne. Some Labour MPs are unhappy about Tory defector Natalie Elphicke's past comments. The BBC chairman helped him secure a loan guarantee weeks before the then-PM recommended him for the role, a paper says. The minister is accused of using demeaning and intimidating language towards a civil servant when he was defence secretary. Eddie Reeves has been the Conservatives' leader on Oxfordshire County Council since May 2021.

        "title": "Donald Trump: UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary'",
        "text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer. Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK. Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\". Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes. The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine. Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". He said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. He later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday. The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK. Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\" \"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said. \"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\" In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US. In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way. However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\". \"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\". He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "GPs in England strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments",
        "text": "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said. The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients. The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices. However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament. GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under. Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments. Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment. Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am. It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up. Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised. The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need. The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%. The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients. Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff. GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations. Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\". \"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said. \"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment. \"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year. \"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\" Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed. \"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future. \"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\" Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving. She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff. She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\". Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs. Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\" But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added. Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract. \"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added. Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development. \"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff. \"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said. \"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\" A record 11.4 million appointments were delivered by GP surgeries across Sussex last year. Muhameed Saeed posed as a doctor for three decades before his deception was uncovered. Dr Rachel Ali is taking part in a work-to-rule in protest at lack of funding for general practice. Councillors from across the political spectrum want an independent inquiry into the troubled firm. Aneurin Bevan health board said it will take over the running of Brynmawr Medical Practice from March. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Keir Starmer gives Donald Trump state visit invitation from the King",
        "text": "US President Donald Trump has been invited to the UK for a second state visit by the King. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer used his trip to the White House to present Trump with the invitation letter from King Charles. Sir Keir said the president's last state visit in 2019 had been a \"tremendous success\" and that the invite for a second visit was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\". Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country. He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\". Traditionally second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle. King Charles' letter proposed a meeting to discuss details of the state visit at either Dumfries House or Balmoral, both in Scotland, a country to which Trump has connections. His mother was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis. This year he is planning to open a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, to be named after his mother. The letter, which Trump showed to the cameras, read: \"Quite apart from this presenting an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest, it would also offer a valuable chance to plan a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom. \"As you will know this is unprecedented by a US president. That is why I would find it helpful for us to be able to discuss, together, a range of options for location and programme content. \"In so doing, working together, I know we will further enhance the special relationship between our two countries of which we are both so proud.\" Trump joked that he would have to check if the signature was real. At a joint news conference later, Trump said a trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\" and could see the UK avoiding the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on other countries. Sir Keir said the two countries would begin work on a new economic deal which would be centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. During his visit Sir Keir also hopes to influence Trump as he seeks to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. Speaking on the plane to the US, Sir Keir told reporters that a deal would not stop Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine again, unless the US were able to provide security guarantees. Asked if the US could offer such support, Trump said a proposed deal with Ukraine over access to critical minerals would provide \"a backstop\". \"We are a backstop because we will be over there, we will be working in the country,\" he said. Since becoming prime minister, Sir Keir, who had previously been critical of the president, has sought to build a close relationship with Trump. However, he did feel compelled to contradict the US president when he accused Volodymyr Zelensky of being a dictator. Asked about his dictator comments, Trump said: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\" Pressed over whether he would approve the UK's potential deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, Trump said: \"We're going to have some discussions about that very soon, and I have a feeling it's going to work out very well. \"I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country,\" In an interview after arriving in the US on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the controversial deal would not go ahead unless the US supported it. Under the proposal, the UK would cede sovereignty of the Chagos archipelago to Mauritius but would still be able to use one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which includes a UK-US military airbase. The United States has never had an official language since it was founded nearly 250 years ago. Donald Trump will not get involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, but can Europe fill the gap? Thousands of workers have been fired by the Trump administration as part of its effort to slash the federal workforce. President Trump continues to play global disruptor while the world does its best to engage with him. The US president is invited to a royal estate in Scotland to discuss the logistics of a second state visit. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Ban degrading and violent online pornography, review proposes",
        "text": "Degrading, violent and misogynistic pornography should be banned, a review of the industry has recommended. The review, commissioned by the previous government and headed by the Conservative peer Baroness Gabby Bertin, urges ministers to give regulator Ofcom sweeping powers to police porn sites deemed to contain \"harmful\" material. It proposes outlawing \"degrading, violent and misogynistic content\", including making it illegal to possess or publish pornography showing women being choked during sex. Non-fatal strangulation is already an offence if someone does not consent but its depiction online is not illegal and the review finds it is \"rife on mainstream platforms\". The review proposes that porn videos considered too harmful for any certificate in the offline world should be banned online. Baroness Bertin argues that online pornography contributes to some of the \"gravest issues in our society, from domestic violence to toxic masculinity to the mental health crisis among young people\". She told the BBC: \"I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch porn. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist. I'm not a prude.\" However, her 32 recommendations on what government should do about the \"high-harm sector\" of legal online pornography are likely to initiate a debate about how far the state should police people's sex lives. Baroness Bertin said online porn was not \"properly scrutinised and regulated\" in the same way as offline content. \"It strikes me as incredible that to buy a DVD, which sounds so sort of retro, the BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] has to put a stamp on it, has to check that certain standards have been met. That there's no sense you are encouraging child sexual abuse. No harmful, degrading, humiliating practices which is not through consensual roleplay,\" she told the BBC. \"You just have to go on the homepages of some of these mainstream sites and you will see of all that degrading content \u2013 particularly violent towards women \u2013 and it's all there for everyone to see.\" Her report suggests pornography websites depicting the non-fatal choking of women during sex has normalised such behaviour in the real world, with violent and degrading material rife on mainstream platforms amid a \"total absence of government scrutiny\". The review cites research suggesting that over a quarter of the nation regularly accesses online porn with a third of all men watching material at least once a week. It concludes that increasingly disturbing content is \"rewiring\" the way young people think about gender, sex and their role in society. The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said it would look at the links the review highlighted. \"We have already announced we will ban the creation of intimate deepfakes without consent and from next month under the Online Safety Act platforms will have to proactively tackle illegal content including extreme pornography and sexual abuse material,\" the spokesperson said. \"But further action is needed to address the review's shocking finding that graphic strangulation is increasingly appearing in pornography, despite being illegal, and is becoming normalised in real life. \"We will urgently ensure that platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors take all necessary steps to tackle this disturbing harm.\" Downing Street also described the findings of a report into the porn industry as \"shocking\", and suggested it would \"act swiftly\" to address gaps in the law - but stopped short of saying it would be banned. The review's recommendations were welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition, which called for action from the government to address the harms arising from the current state of the porn industry. \"We know these companies are profiting enormously from sexual violence, and until they are forced to clean up their act, they won't,\" the group's director Andrea Simon said. Madelaine Thomas, an adult content creator, also welcomed the review but added: \"If we look to police people's sexual interests that's problematic. \"I don't think prohibition has ever eliminated demand in any way but I do think there are ways that we can work together to come up with frameworks that prioritise both consent and compassion and allow people to create and view what they would like to view on the internet,\" she told BBC Two's Politics Live. Baroness Bertin argues that her proposals for sweeping new controls in currently legal pornography online would prevent real-world violence against women and girls. The review relates how a 14-year-old boy asked a teacher how to choke girls during sex and suggests online porn has created \"such a confusing world for our sons\". \"They are, quite rightly, encouraged and taught to reject sexist attitudes, while a subterranean online world of pornography is simultaneously showing them that anything goes,\" Baroness Bertin writes. Ministers are urged to fund programmes for boys and young men which encourage positive masculinity and counter misogynistic culture. The report quotes BBC research suggesting up to 38% of British women had experienced being strangled during intercourse, but notes that nearly half of those women wanted to be choked. \"This is important in demonstrating freedom of sexual expression and its nuance,\" the review says. Nevertheless, the report concludes that society has decided that \"enough is enough\" of harmful online pornography and its impact on young people. Measures to increase regulation of pornography, including to prevent children accessing explicit content, are already part of the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023.

        "title": "Anneliese Dodds resigns over Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to cut aid budget | Anneliese Dodds | The Guardian",
        "text": "Exclusive: International development minister warns it will be \u2018impossible\u2019 to retain funding in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, has quit her post over Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to slash the international aid budget by almost half to pay for a generational increase in defence spending. The senior Labour MP, who attended cabinet, predicted that the UK pulling back from development would bolster Russia, which has already been aggressively increasing its presence worldwide, as well as encourage China\u2019s attempts to rewrite global rules. She said the prime minister would find it \u201cimpossible\u201d to honour his commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine with the diminished budget, which will fall by about \u00a36bn by 2027. Dodds said she firmly believed the prime minister was right to increase defence spending, as the postwar consensus had \u201ccome crashing down\u201d after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. She recognised there were \u201cnot easy paths\u201d to doing so, and had been prepared for some cuts to the aid budget to help pay for the plan to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 \u2013 and an ambition to hit 3% in the next parliament. But the former shadow chancellor said she believed Starmer\u2019s 3% ambition \u201cmay only be the start\u201d given the tumultuous global picture, and urged the government to look at other ways of raising the money other than through cutting departmental budgets, including looking again at borrowing rules and taxation. Starmer replied with his own letter several hours after Dodds announced her resignation, in which he praised Dodds but defended his decision to cut the aid budget. Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 46%, from 0.56% of gross national income [GNI] to 0.3%, after Donald Trump\u2019s own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. In a cabinet meeting several spoke of the risk of unintended consequences. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US\u2019s plan to cut aid funding could be a \u201cbig strategic mistake\u201d that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence. Starmer has been accused of pandering to the US president. Dodds, the MP for Oxford East, said she was told about the decision by Starmer only on Monday, but delayed resigning so as not to overshadow the prime minister\u2019s trip to Washington to make the case to Trump for security guarantees for Ukraine. Starmer made his surprise announcement in the Commons, telling MPs that Britain would \u201cfight for peace in Europe\u201d with a generational increase in defence spending. The announcement, two days before the prime minister was due to meet Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was following the US\u2019s lead and prompted fury from aid groups, who said it could cost lives in countries that relied on UK support. Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army, told the Guardian the decision to cut foreign aid was a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that would ultimately add to the burden on Britain\u2019s armed forces, and risked making the UK \u201cweaker not stronger\u201d. Dodds, in her letter to the prime minister, wrote: \u201cUndoubtedly the postwar global order has come crashing down. I believe that we must increase spending on defence as a result; and know that there are no easy paths to doing so. \u201cI stood ready to work with you to deliver that increased spending, knowing some might well have had to come from overseas development assistance [ODA]. I also expected we would collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, as other nations are doing. \u201cEven 3% may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country\u2019s security cannot be ducked.\u201d Dodds, who was also a minister for women, was sceptical about Starmer\u2019s promise to maintain aid funding for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, as well as for vaccination, climate and rules-based systems. Officials have said that the portion of the development budget going on asylum seeker accommodation \u2013 which stands at almost a third \u2013 would eventually be freed up for aid. Dodds wrote: \u201cIt will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut; the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.\u201d And she cautioned about the effect on Britain\u2019s national security and global influence as hostile nations moved into the breach. \u201cThe cut will also likely lead to a UK pullout from numerous African, Caribbean and western Balkan nations at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence,\u201d she said. \u201cAll this while China is seeking to rewrite global rules, and when the climate crisis is the biggest security threat of them all.\u201d Explaining why she had delayed her resignation while Starmer was in Washington, she said: \u201cIt was imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington. Your determination to pursue peace through strength for Ukraine is one I share. \u201cIt is for that reason that I am only writing to you now that your meeting with President Trump is over, and four days after you informed me of your decision to cut overseas development assistance to 0.3% of GNI.\u201d She concluded: \u201cUltimately, these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people \u2013 deeply harming the UK\u2019s reputation. I know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump\u2019s slipstream of cuts to USAid.\u201d In reply, Starmer wrote: \u201cOverseas development is vitally important, and I am proud of what we have done. The UK will still be providing significant humanitarian and development support, and we will continue to protect vital programmes \u2013 including in the world\u2019s worst conflict zones of Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan. \u201cThe decision I have taken on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development. \u201cHowever, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.\u201d He also seemed to hold out the prospect of a return to the frontbench should Dodds choose to do so. \u201cI know you will have more to contribute in the future and continue to represent your constituents in Oxford East with dedication.\u201d Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, tweeted: \u201cWhat else could she do? She knows these cuts are unworkable. Honourable as always, she\u2019s done right by her department & right by the PM by not resigning before DC visit. Deep shame for development where she was respected.\u201d The Conservative former aid secretary Andrew Mitchell said Dodds had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d by resigning, adding: \u201cLabour\u2019s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour party\u2019s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle.\u201d Romilly Greenhill, chief executive of Bond, the umbrella organisation for aid charities, said: \u201cThis will be a huge loss. It is clear from the devastating UK aid cuts announced this week, which must be reversed, that the government is trying to step back from its development ambitions.\u201d",

        "text": "PM tells former minister \u2018you will have more to contribute\u2019 but says reduction in aid spending is part of \u2018protecting our national security\u2019 Downing Street has released the text of Keir Starmer\u2019s response to Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation letter. He defends the decision to cut aid spending, saying \u201cprotecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government\u201d, but praises her work as a minister. \u201cI know you will have more to contribute in the future,\u201d he says, implying a return to government could be possible. Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, has quit her post over Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to slash the international aid budget by almost half to pay for a generational increase in defence spending. Keir Starmer will hold talks with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni in Downing Street on Sunday before a major London defence summit aimed at securing \u201clasting and enforced\u201d peace in Ukraine. Prisoners may have to earn their freedom through \u201cgood behaviour credits\u201d rather than be automatically released after a set period as part of an overhaul being considered by the government. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is holding an urgent meeting on Friday with Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC, after the corporation apologised for \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the making of a documentary about the war in Gaza. Members of the Youth Parliament were probably spared some of the more arcane rules of Commons procedure. In an interview with Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Carla Denyer, the Green party co-leader, complains about it being \u2018a club with weird rules\u201d. She is particularly critical of one, which she says amounts to \u201ccompulsory participation in prayers in a particular religion [the Church of England]\u201d for MPs who want to take part in debates on busy days. She explains: Your listeners will have seen photos and videos of how packed it gets, especially on budget day or prime minister\u2019s questions. There\u2019s only room for about 450 people to sit down in there, even though there are 650 MPs. So on busy days, you see MPs in the aisles and perching on a step and so on. What I didn\u2019t know until I got elected is that you are not allowed to speak in the chamber unless you\u2019re on one of the main benches. You\u2019re not allowed to take part in the democratic debate. And the way that you make sure you get one of those seats on the benches is to turn up two, three hours before the debate starts, put a prayer card, a little business card with your name on, on the seat you want to sit on, and then you have to turn up for the beginning of prayers. There are Church of England prayers every morning before the debate starts. Now, that\u2019s our state religion. If that\u2019s part of the tradition that happens at the beginning of every day, I don\u2019t have a problem with that in and of itself. But the point is that, if you don\u2019t get there for the beginning of prayers and take part in prayers, then the card gets whipped away and you don\u2019t get to sit down. Therefore you don\u2019t get to take part in the debate \u2026 It\u2019s a club with weird rules with, basically, compulsory participation in prayers in a particular religion, whether that\u2019s your faith or not, in order to take part. Members of the Youth Parliament, young people aged between 11 and 18, have been sitting in the Common chamber today to debate a series of issues. It is an annual event that allows them to get experience of the political process and highlight issues of importance to young people. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has said she wants to give elected mayors \u201csledgehammer\u201d powers so they can smash obstacles to housebuilding in England. In a speech at the Convention of the North in Preston, she said that the planning and infrastracture bill would give regional mayors new powers over housing and regeneration. She went on: All of you in this room are trying \u2013 like I am - to get Britain building again. Yes, building houses, but also building your business, building renewable energy, building data centres. All too often, we are met by a system that says: \u201cdon\u2019t bother\u201d. Well, I am determined to break that system. And I am handing mayors the sledgehammer! Mayors are at the centre of our plans to build 1.5 million homes, by giving them the powers they need, mayors are an army to take on the blockers. We are backing them to work across huge regional geographies to get the job done. It\u2019s why we\u2019re giving them the powers to call in applications on those large, strategic sites that will really turn the wheel on growth. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re putting grant funding for regeneration and housing in their hands. To enable mayors to deliver on their plans, we will forge a stronger partnership between them and Homes England. Over time, we will move Homes England to a more regionalised model so that the agency is even more responsive to the economic plan of an area. Rayner said the planning bill would be introduced into parliament within weeks. And she said, in areas without a mayor, it would allow councils \u201cto come together and set spatial development strategies\u201d. Aid charities were appalled by the goverment\u2019s decision to slash development spending, and so it is not surprising that many of them have welcomed Anneliese Dodds\u2019 decision to resign over the cuts rather than stay in government to implement them. Here are some of the comments they have been issuing this afternon. From Romilly Greenhill, CEO at Bond, a network representing aid agencies I am sad to see Anneliese Dodds resign - we agree with much of what she has stated in her letter. She was an excellent advocate for women and girls and was dedicated to rebuilding the UK\u2019s reputation on development. We also appreciate the level of engagement she had with the sector. From Kathleen Spencer Chapman, director of influencing and external affairs at Plan International UK We share Annelise Dodds\u2019 extreme disappointment at the prime minister\u2019s shortsighted decision to slash the overseas aid budget. Her resignation shows that the most influential politicians in the Labour Party echo our outrage at the government\u2019s decision to slash an already woefully cut overseas aid budget. From Patrick Watt, CEO at Christian Aid Christian Aid welcomes the strong stand that the now former development minister Anneliese Dodds has taken today against this week\u2019s brutal aid cuts. Dodds has rightly recognised that these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people, will likely lead to a total pull out from many of the world\u2019s poorest countries, and will deeply harm the UK\u2019s reputation and influence globally. We thank Anneliese Dodds for her hard work and commitment in this brief and for the stance she has taken today and we look forward to working with her on the backbenches. Downing Street has released the text of Keir Starmer\u2019s response to Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation letter. He defends the decision to cut aid spending, saying \u201cprotecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government\u201d, but praises her work as a minister. \u201cI know you will have more to contribute in the future,\u201d he says, implying a return to government could be possible. Keir Starmer is preparing to discuss how to guarantee a peace deal in Ukraine will last when he meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Downing Street this weekend, PA Media reports. PA says: Leaders from across Europe will gather in London on Sunday, following a week which will have seen Starmer, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and the Ukrainian president travel for talks with US president Donald Trump. Ahead of Sunday\u2019s summit focused on security, the prime minister will meet with Zelenskyy separately. Starmer returned to the UK today following a trip to the White House which went as well as No 10 could have hoped, with Trump clearly pleased with the king\u2019s invitation for an unprecedented second state visit, giving an indication that he would not block the Chagos Islands deal and suggesting a trade deal could spare British exports from US tariffs. As well as the meeting with Zelenskyy, Sunday will see the prime minister meet separately with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and chair a call with the Baltic countries \u2013 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2013 before hosting the summit. Zelenskyy, Macron and Meloni have been invited to the summit along with leaders from Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania, as well as the Nato secretary general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council. They will discuss the next steps in planning for security guarantees if a Ukraine peace deal is reached \u2013 something Starmer believes will have to involve the US. The leaders will consider how to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s current position, with military support and increased economic pressure on Russia. The UK wants US military assets to provide surveillance, intelligence and \u2013 potentially \u2013 warplanes providing air cover to deter Vladimir Putin from launching another bid to conquer his neighbour. The SNP is calling for a Commons vote on the aid cuts announced by Keir Starmer on Tuesday to fund higher defence spending. In a statement issued after Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation, Stephen Flynn, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said: Keir Starmer\u2019s wreckless plans to slash UK international aid are strategically damaging, immoral and yet another broken Labour Party manifesto pledge. MPs must be given a vote for such a drastic and harmful step, which rips up decades of vital work, will plunge some of the world\u2019s poorest people further into desperation and may cost lives. The Labour MP Clive Lewis told Radio 4\u2019s World at One that Anneliese Dodds was someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to rock the boat\u201d and who would not have resigned lightly. And he suggested that other factors, like the government\u2019s general \u201cdirection of travel\u201d, might have influenced her decision. He said: I get the impression from reading her resignation letter that there this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, a rather big straw, but nonetheless it\u2019s one of a series of decisions that have been taken. The direction of travel of our own government has left not just MPs uneasy, but lots of our voter base, and I think it\u2019s something that the prime minister and the cabinet would do well to reflect on. Although Dodds was appointed as Keir Starmer\u2019s first shadow chancellor, and served in that post for about a year, she is more leftwing than he is. Some of Starmer\u2019s supporters wanted him to appointed Rachel Reeves in 2020, but she was deemed unacceptable to the left, and to key trade unions, and that is partly why Dodds got the job instead. Lewis also said he thought it was significant that Dodds, in her resignation letter (see 12.29pm), suggested that Labour should reconsider its fiscal rules and its pledges on tax. He said: I don\u2019t think I got elected \u2026 to cut support to the poorest, whether it\u2019s in this country or overseas. And I think what she\u2019s saying is we need to have a conversation, the world is changing, and when it comes to defence, if we want to go beyond 2.4, 2.5%, maybe 3%, maybe beyond, that\u2019s going to require a real conversation about the fiscal rules that we have, about borrowing and about who\u2019s being taxed. You have probably noted that 138 aid agencies have written in saying we should be looking at wealth taxes. Well, that\u2019s something lots of Labour MPs, lots of the public, think should be happening. Lewis said the UK was good at taxing income, but not wealth. That would have to change, said. We tax income extremely well. We don\u2019t tax wealth anywhere near as much. And this is the conversation this government is going to have to have, because whether it comes to public spending domestically or internationally, or on defence, or investment into net zero and all the other things that we now want to do in terms of industrial manufacturing and supply chains, we need to have that resource. Lewis was referring to this letter signed by 138 leaders of in the aid sector. It says: We urgently call on this government to make a statement to parliament, outlining whether the impact of these cuts has been thought through and whether alternative sources of funding were explored before deciding to remove support to those who need it the most. A wealth tax of just 2% on wealth above \u00a310m (affecting just 0.04% of the population) would raise \u00a324bn annually. It is unacceptable that taxing extreme wealth was not looked at before cutting UK aid. A wealth tax on assets above the value of \u00a310m was Green party policy at the last election. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, has defended the government\u2019s decision to cut aid spendng to fund a higher defence budget. Speaking to broadcasters today, she said she was sorry to hear of Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation, but went on: It is really difficult decision that was made, but it was absolutely right that the prime minister and the cabinet endorsed the prime minister\u2019s actions to spend more money on defence. We want to see the economy grow so that we can then get back to having more money to spend on things like overseas aid and on our public services. The Liberal Democrats says the government\u2019s cuts to the aid buget are \u201cunsustainable\u201d. In a comment on Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation, Monica Harding, the Lib Dem international affairs spokesperson, said: Anneliese Dodds has done the right thing. The government\u2019s position on the international aid cut is unsustainable. Increasing defence spending to 2.5% is the right thing to do as the global threats we face intensify. But doing so by cutting the international aid budget is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. The government hasn\u2019t even carried out an impact assessment. Diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities \u2013 they are complementary. Where we withdraw our aid, it\u2019s Russia and China who will fill the vacuum. Kemi Badenoch has responded to the news of Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation by saying that Keir Starmer was right to slash the aid budget to find higher defence spending. She posted this on social media. I disagree with the PM on many things BUT on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He\u2019s absolutely right. He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him. National interest always comes first. The news coverage of Keir Starmer\u2019s visit to the White House yesterday is overwhelmingly positive. But in the comment pages, the verdict is a lot more nuanced. Here are extracts from five articles on the visit that are worth a read. Stephen Bush in the Financial Times says the postive aspects of the trip don\u2019t alter the fundamental difficulties. You can see the outlines of something that works for all concerned, in policy terms: the UK government continues to buy technology that it thinks is top-of-the-range, it signs some sort of deal trumpeting that, and it avoids tariffs \u2014 trebles all round in Downing Street and the Foreign Office. But: the big picture political thing that the UK government and essentially all of Europe wants is some sign that the combined Macron-Starmer charm offensive might do anything to pull Trump and the US back into the defence of Europe. That didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think anyone reasonably expected that mission to succeed (there is a reason why Starmer already has another appointment in his diplomatic calendar to meet fellow European leaders) but nevertheless, this remains the single biggest problem facing the UK and its neighbours. In addition, the long-term politics of all this look very fraught. Labour\u2019s liberal base is essentially being asked to stomach: a) a rhetorically warm relationship with a president it hates b) slow, and in some policy areas, non-existent progress on domestic social policy c) cuts to the overseas development budget to finance increases in defence spending. Freddie Hayward at the New Statesman says the real story from the trip is about Britain\u2019s weakness. Before No 10 commission a triumphal arch on the Mall, remember the Prime Minister was there to get a security guarantee for Ukraine. What happened? As expected, Trump dismissed the idea of even providing air cover, and instead said the presence of American workers, presumably mining Ukraine\u2019s rare earths, will deter any \u201cplaying around\u201d. Trump does not want American troops in danger on Europe\u2019s eastern flank \u2026 The real story of Starmer\u2019s trip was, therefore, British weakness. Look at what was done, not what was said. Flattery occluded the material realities; diplomatic procedure papered over uncouth power imbalances. Those taken in by the sweet words Trump offered to the Prime Minister in the Oval Office should remember that the US president once wrote love letters to Kim Jong Un; that for the first time since 1945 the US voted with Russia, North Korea and Belarus at the UN last week; and that JD Vance has said attacks on free speech in the UK meant the US was questioning whether it was even worth protecting its allies. David Blair in the Telegraph says three words from Trump made the trip a success. With three vital words, Donald Trump made Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s visit to the White House a success. \u201cI support it,\u201d said the president, when asked whether he backed Article V of the Nato treaty, which binds the US and every other member to come to the defence of any ally. Barely a fortnight after Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, sent tremors through Europe by appearing to suggest that America\u2019s commitment to Nato was conditional and wavering, Mr Trump offered reassurance \u2026 At one point, Mr Trump turned to Sir Keir and asked, half jokingly, whether Britain could take on Russia alone. Despite the warm words, the message was clear: never forget your dependence on America. But Ian Dunt in a post on his Substack blog draws the opposite conclusion, and argues that what Trump said showed Nato is not safe. Keir Starmer\u2019s visit to the White House yesterday was generally well received. The British right were thwarted in their clear desire to see Donald Trump publicly humiliate him. There was a fairly warm reception to the Chagos deal and some mention of avoiding tariffs. That all secured some rare front page praise today, with the Mail saying \u201cwhat an unlikely bromance\u201d, the Telegraph saying \u201cTrump backs Starmer on Chagos\u201d and the Times emphasising a possible trade deal. The PM\u2019s team will consider that a good day at work. Britain is managing to hide in the undergrowth while this demented gorilla goes on the warpath. Unfortunately, none of it means anything. The one supreme matter of historic importance at the moment concerns American security guarantees for Ukraine. Without them, there is no Nato. Without them, there is a significantly increased incentive for Russia to continue a policy of imperial expansionism. Without them, we inch closer and closer to European powers entering into direct military conflict with Russia. But on this point Starmer failed to secure any meaningful assurance at all, just like Emmanuel Macron earlier in the week. You can\u2019t fault either man. They did their best. But the basic truth is that they came back empty handed. \u201cCould you take on Russia by yourselves?\u201d Trump asked Starmer yesterday, a vicious reptilian smile plastered across his face. And in that joke, and the laughter that surrounded it, was the death of Nato, the end of any meaningful US commitment to Europe, the rejection of a united West, a once-great power turned into a small dog that bares its stomach to Russian tyranny. Gaby Hinsliff in the Guardian says this is no longer a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. Starmer laid on the flattery with the recommended trowel, handing over an invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second state visit that evidently delighted the president. But though Trump praised him as a \u2018special man\u2019, this no longer feels like a special relationship; more the kind of loveless transaction that leaves both sides feeling grubby. Green party parliamentarians are also praising Anneliese Dodds for her decision to resign over the government\u2019s cuts to the aid budget. This is from Adrian Ramsay, the party\u2019s co-leader A principled decision by Anneliese Dodds. And she\u2019s right. Keir Starmer\u2019s decision to cut the aid budget will prevent crucial support to war-torn countries. Support that is vital for our security. The Prime Minister\u2019s decision is a dereliction of duty And this is from Natalie Bennett, a Green peer and former party leader Principles in politics. What a refreshing sight!\n   Much respect to Anneliese Dodds.#AidCuts And this is from the Lib Dem peer Chris Rennard A courageous and correct decision mirroring the resignation of Baroness Sugg when Boris Johnson cut the overseas aid budget. We need to assist with development to help the world\u2019s poorest, create stability, and use soft power effectively. Andrew Mitchell, a former Tory international develpment secretary, has praised Anneliese Dodds for resigning. As Patrick Wintour reports, Mitchell said: Anneliese has done the right thing. Labour\u2019s disgraceful and cynical actions demean Labour\u2019s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the world\u2019s poorest. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of principle and decency. As Patrick Wintour, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, the cuts to the aid budget announced on Tueday, that triggered Anneliese Dodds\u2019 resignation, will take UK development spending to its lowest level as a percentage of national income since records began, an analysis says. Here is a profile of Anneliese Dodds by Kiran Stacey.",

        "title": "Starmer to hold talks with Zelenskyy and Meloni before Ukraine defence summit | Ukraine | The Guardian",
        "text": "Prime minister will host more than a dozen countries over weekend as Europe tries to secure deal to end war Keir Starmer will hold talks with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni in Downing Street on Sunday before a major London defence summit aimed at securing \u201clasting and enforced\u201d peace in Ukraine. Fresh from his trip to see Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, Starmer has headed back to London to host the defence summit, where more than a dozen world leaders will gather to discuss Ukraine. The prime minister had invited France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Turkey, as well as Ukraine. After Starmer\u2019s meeting with Trump, the leaders of the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were added to the list of attenders. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, will also attend. Starmer and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, both undertook trips to the US this week, with the European leaders trying to persuade Trump to provide security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any negotiated peace. The US president is resisting calls to fully commit US military support to guarantee any Ukraine peace deal, but has suggested that closer economic ties and an agreement on mineral access between Kyiv and Washington would, in effect, act as a security \u201cbackstop\u201d. Zelenskyy travelled to Washington on Friday to sign a critical minerals deal, and to push the president on providing security protections for Kyiv to deter Russia from launching another attack \u2013 if a peace agreement is signed. A Downing Street spokesperson said on Friday that \u201cthe UK has made it clear that we\u2019ll play our full part in ensuring a just and lasting peace deal on Ukraine\u2019s terms, backed up by strong security guarantees\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cJust this week we demonstrated our commitment to that confirming we\u2019ll increase defence spending to 2.5% by 2027. But that peace deal has to come first and as you know the prime minister will meet President Zelensky before convening European leaders in London on Sunday to continue those discussions. \u201cThe deal has to come first, but our teams are going to be talking about how we make sure that deal sticks and is lasting and enforced.\u201d Starmer\u2019s trip to the US was regarded as having gone well, with Trump expressing warmth towards the UK prime minister and pleased by an invitation to visit the king. During Sunday\u2019s event, Starmer is expected to chair a pre-summit call with the Baltic countries \u2013 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2013 before hosting the conference of European leaders. At the summit, the leaders will consider how to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position with military support and increased economic pressure on Russia. The UK wants US military assets to provide surveillance, intelligence and \u2013 potentially \u2013 warplanes providing air cover to deter Vladimir Putin from launching another attempt to conquer his neighbour. In Washington on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cWell, there is a backstop. First, you have European countries, because they\u2019re right there, we\u2019re very far away, we have an ocean between us. But we want to make sure it works.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe are a backstop because we\u2019ll be over there, we\u2019ll be working in the country. \u201d Starmer moved to increase defence spending to 3% of national income earlier this week, paying for it by cutting foreign aid. Other European leaders are also coming under pressure to raise defence spending, with Trump\u2019s administration making clear that the US cannot be relied on to contribute as much in future. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said it was a \u201cgenerational moment for our continent\u201d as she discussed security and defence with European finance leaders at the G20 this week. Saying it was a \u201cmore dangerous world\u201d, Reeves said the UK will \u201cnot hide from this reality\u201d as the G20 talked about what could be done to boost defence across Europe. \u201cThis is the moment for us all to step up and together with our European partners we will go further and faster on defence,\u201d she added.",

But that doesn\u2019t always mean the descent has to be slow. \u201cThere may be circumstances when a slower-than-expected descent is justified but there will also be times when conditions require that the pace has to quicken.\u201d The Bank cut rates by a quarter point to 4.5% earlier this month and signalled that it expects to continue reducing borrowing costs, despite forecasting a \u201cbump\u201d in inflation in the coming months. In an address that repeatedly stressed the heightened uncertainty facing policymakers, Ramsden said that inflation is now as likely to overshoot as to undershoot. Ramsden backed a quarter-point interest rate cut in December, against the majority, fearing the jobs market was cooling rapidly and could lead inflation to undershoot. But with the Bank now expecting inflation to rise to 3.7% later this year, and average weekly earnings growth to be 6.75% in the first quarter, much higher than previously forecast, he now believes the risks are balanced. \u201cBecause of the evidence of recent months, I no longer think that risks to hitting the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium-term are to the downside. Instead, I think they are two sided,\u201d he said. He highlighted particular uncertainty about the outlook for the jobs market. Policymakers are concerned about the risks of a rapid downturn as the government\u2019s increase in employer national insurance contributions takes effect in April \u2013 but are also worried about recent stronger-than-expected wage data. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Ramsden also pointed to the risks around trade policies, with Washington threatening tariffs on a slew of countries. \u201cThe UK is a relatively small open economy so these matter,\u201d he said. Markets are expecting the Bank to keep interest rates on hold at its next policy meeting on 20 March but have priced in two further cuts this year, taking the Bank rate down to 4%.",

        "text": "Prime minister\u2019s cuts to overseas aid was last straw for capable politician who served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow Treasury team For the first year of Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership of the Labour party, Anneliese Dodds served as a visible reassurance to the left of the party that he intended to continue the legacy of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. Having served in Corbyn\u2019s shadow Treasury team under John McDonnell, Dodds was promoted to shadow chancellor when Starmer took over in 2020. However, her slow slide down the ministerial ranks since has encapsulated the prime minister\u2019s steady shift to the right. Her dramatic resignation on Friday is the latest sign of how far those on the soft left of the party \u2013 even those who have remained loyal throughout \u2013 have been pushed to one side under the prime minister\u2019s leadership. Dodds, a bookish intellectual who studied at Oxford, Edinburgh and the London School of Economics, was first elected to parliament in 2017. An expert in government and public policy, she was snapped up by McDonnell soon after becoming an MP to work in his team as shadow junior Treasury minister. While working under Corbyn, she was known as a capable media performer who could promote policies such as hiking corporation tax without the belligerence shown by some of her more outspoken colleagues. She also earned a reputation as one of Brexit\u2019s most vocal opponents, supporting Starmer in his calls for a second referendum, promising to try to \u201cstop the government from pursuing its extreme, chaotic version of Brexit\u201d. When Starmer appointed her as shadow chancellor, the decision was welcomed even by those who later become some of his staunchest opponents in the party. \u201cAnneliese was a superb member of my Treasury team, is really talented, works incredibly hard and is conscientious in all she does,\u201d McDonnell said. Just a year later, however, Starmer changed his entire approach after a crushing set of local election results, which included losing the previously safe seat of Hartlepool in a byelection. The Labour leader decided he needed to pivot to the right, and reshuffled his frontbench team, moving Dodds to the job of party chair and replacing her with Rachel Reeves. She was to take up the role of equalities secretary later that year after the resignation of Marsha de Cordova, and chaired the Labour policy review that helped inform the party\u2019s election manifesto last year. Having been a shadow cabinet minister from 2020 until the election, Dodds found herself demoted once more when Labour entered government, with her women and equalities portfolio downgraded to that of a minister of state. But she was also given the job of overseeing international development within the Foreign Office, with both roles allowing her to attend cabinet without being a secretary of state. Starmer was already signalling his declining commitment to international aid, reversing a pledge to re-establish the Department for International Development as separate to the Foreign Office. However, the prime minister remained committed \u2013 at least rhetorically \u2013 to lifting the amount Britain spends on aid to 0.7% of gross national income. So when he told cabinet ministers this week that, in the short term at least, he would not raise the aid budget but slash it by half instead to pay for defence spending, this was the last straw for the previously ultra-loyal Dodds. \u201cI know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development,\u201d she wrote in her understated, but devastating resignation letter. \u201cBut the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump\u2019s slipstream of cuts to USAid.\u201d \u201cI will continue to support you,\u201d she added. \u201cBut now I will do so from the backbenches.\u201d",

        "text": "Justice secretary considers introduction of good behaviour credits in radical \u2018carrot-and-stick\u2019 approach Prisoners may have to earn their freedom through \u201cgood behaviour credits\u201d rather than be automatically released after a set period as part of an overhaul being considered by the government. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who travelled to Texas where a similar scheme was introduced more than a decade ago, said she wanted a \u201ccarrot-and-stick\u201d approach throughout the prison system in England and Wales. In Texas, there is no automatic early release scheme. Instead, prisoners can reduce the length of time they serve by earning \u201cgood behaviour and good time\u201d credits, which means they can serve as little as 25% of their sentence behind bars if they maintain good behaviour and work productively. Automatic early release was introduced in England and Wales in 1991 for prisoners sentenced to less than four years, but expanded to more serious criminals in 2003. Now up to 70% of prisoners will be released automatically. If rolled out, prisoners could earn credits via work, training or taking part in any education scheme. Mahmood told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be open to all potential future constructions of sentences. If you\u2019re going to think about incentivised behaviour, obviously it\u2019s a carrot and a stick, isn\u2019t it? So you can\u2019t then leave unchanged the rest of your current sentencing framework on automatic releases. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go down the road of incentivisation, actually that might mean some things no longer become automatic. But we would have to consider carefully how you would take the best learning from the law and read across to our system because our arrangements are different. Although that\u2019s the benefit of having a review, which means we can.\u201d David Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary under Theresa May\u2019s premiership, accompanied Mahmood on the Texas trip, during which they assessed how well good behaviour and intensive rehabilitation schemes had helped to reduce prison overcrowding. Such changes in the US state have reduced the number of offenders recalled to jail to 16.6%, as national levels hover about 68%. Gauke said incentivising people over time allowed a \u201cmore considered approach to assessing their behaviour\u201d. A large proportion of prisoners in England and Wales are released on licence after serving 40-60% of fixed-term sentences. Last week, the Prison Reform Trust urged the government to consider abolishing the use of short, fixed-term recalls of 28 days or fewer, amid concerns that the rising numbers of people being recalled to prison was \u201ctrapping\u201d them in the criminal justice system. An independent sentencing review said longer jail terms had been a \u201ckneejerk\u201d policy response to show action by successive governments. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Justice, the number of prisoners in England and Wales reached 86,941, the highest since 21 October last year, which was the day before the government released more than 1,000 prisoners as part of its urgent measures to ease the overcrowding crisis.",

        "text": "NGOs accuse prime minister of following US by accepting \u2018false choice\u2019 of cutting aid to fund defence Sir Keir Starmer is to take UK overseas aid to its lowest level as a percentage of national income since records began, even if he manages to halve the current \u00a34.5bn cost of housing asylum seekers. The extraordinary finding, a complete reversal of Labour manifesto pledges and its historical commitment to helping the world\u2019s poorest, is made by Ian Mitchell, the co-director of the respected London-based thinktank the Centre for Global Development. It comes as 138 charities wrote to Starmer saying they are appalled that he is implementing the single largest cut to the UK aid programme in history. On Tuesday Starmer announced the aid budget will be cut from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027. But in 2023, nearly \u00a34.3bn, or 28% of the aid budget, was spent by the Home Office in funding the cost of housing asylum seekers in the UK. Even if these costs were halved in 2027 through a mix of fewer asylum seekers, and lowering the cost of housing each asylum seeker, Mitchell calculates, the UK would still only be spending 0.23% of UK national income in 2027 on overseas aid, the lowest ever share of national income since records began in 1960. The UK\u2019s previous lowest ever share of national income spent on overseas aid was 0.24 % in 1999. If the per-head refugee costs remain at their current level, official development assistance costs for refugees would be closer to \u00a33bn in 2027, and aid not spent on refugees in the UK would fall to 0.20% of GNP. In their letter, the NGOs accused Starmer of following in the US\u2019s footsteps by accepting \u201cthe false choice of cutting the already diminished UK aid to fund defence\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s administration has frozen funding for USAid, the US Agency for International Development, with a view in effect to dismantle it. \u201cWe implore you to reverse this decision before significant damage is done to both the UK\u2019s development and humanitarian work and its global reputation,\u201d said the letter organised by Bond, an umbrella organisation for UK overseas aid groups. It demands a Commons statement setting out what alternatives had been considered before the government decided on Tuesday to take a step that will \u201cdestroy Labour\u2019s legacy on international development\u201d and leave the \u201cgovernment\u2019s ambition to be a reliable development partner on the global stage in tatters\u201d. Areas likely to be affected by UK aid cuts include climate change finance, humanitarian aid programmes, including in Yemen, and funding for Gavi, the Bill Gates-backed global vaccination programme. Experts said the bilateral programmes most likely to be damaged are those aimed at Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Aid groups say that unilateral UK aid projects are likely to be particularly affected because they are easier to exit than ones involving multiple countries. \u201cWith the amount committed to refugees in the UK, and now this cut, there will be almost nothing left. It\u2019s an absolute mess,\u201d one official from the sector said. Whitehall sources said there was still \u201cshock and distress\u201d from those working on aid and development in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), who had already seen their independent department abolished under Boris Johnson. There is already an open voluntary redundancy scheme within the FCDO aimed at reducing headcount and those who work in the department said they thought demand would shoot up because morale is so low. \u201cNo one wants to work on closing down programmes they have spent their working life setting up,\u201d said one civil servant. Sign up to Headlines UK Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Union sources said it was too early to say what cuts would look like, but some reduction in the workforce was inevitable, especially given some staff are paid out of the aid budget. Anneliese Dodds, the development minister, was expected to give a \u201cfireside chat\u201d to those working on development in the department on Thursday to provide reassurances that its work was still valued. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, is being urged by European diplomats to take a lead in calling for the $200bn (\u00a3158.5bn) in frozen Russian assets to be released to help Ukraine, a move that might ease the pressure on the UK aid budget. So far the UK, faced by legal hurdles, had only been willing to use the interest on the frozen funds to guarantee loans to Ukraine, but Lammy, speaking before the aid cuts were announced on Tuesday, said: \u201cEurope has to act quickly, and I believe we should move from freezing assets to seizing assets.\u201d The European diplomats argue US cuts mean \u20ac210bn (\u00a3173bn) of Russia\u2019s frozen money held in the bloc, mainly in Euroclear, a Brussels-based securities depository, has to be seized. They are seeking to overcome resistance from Germany, France and the European Central Bank. Another stopgap is to deploy the \u00a32.5bn of frozen assets of the Russian oligarch and former Chelsea football club owner Roman Abrahamovic. Lammy was only told about the halving of the aid budget 72 hours in advance. Just a fortnight ago he had advised the US it would be a strategic mistake to cut the budget of USAid, the now hastily dismantled US aid programme. Dodds had also repeatedly told the international development select committee she wanted predictability in the aid budget.",

        "text": "Exclusive: Government to grant nature groups a licence for release of rodent species after earlier setbacks The release of beavers into English waterways is to be allowed for the first time in centuries, the Guardian can reveal. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, is to announce that nature groups will be able to get a licence for the release. The first releases could happen this autumn. Until about 20 years ago, the rodent had been extinct in Britain for 400 years, having been hunted for their fur, meat and scent oil. But in recent years, beavers have been returning to our waterways via licensed releases into enclosures and some illegal releases. There are estimated to be about 500 living in the wild in England. Beavers create useful habitats for wildlife and reduce flooding by breaking up waterways, slowing water flow and creating still pools. The government will set out a new approach that will allow beavers to live wild. Release projects will need to set out a 10-year plan to show where and how they would have an impact on the landscape. It is understood there were hesitations in government over releasing the beavers, and Reed\u2019s plan was stalled by No 10 because of concerns it was a Conservative legacy project that could needlessly upset farmers. After the Guardian reported this blocking of the policy, there was outcry from wildlife groups. Defra was in recent days given the green light for the announcement. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is understood to have made representations to Downing Street that beavers could be part of Labour\u2019s growth mission, as the rodents work for free to build infrastructure and restore nature. The industrious animals recently saved the Czech government \u00a31m by building a dam. Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, welcomed the news. \u201cRestoring nature means restoring whole ecosystems, and few can beat the beaver in helping bring landscapes to life,\u201d he said. \u201cThese much-loved animals can help restore rivers and wetlands and reduce flooding and drought. Their eco-engineering creates diverse habitats that are great for local communities and for wildlife. It\u2019s high time for wild releases and excellent that the government is making progress.\u201d There are beaver plans ready to go. One such scheme is the National Trust\u2019s Purbeck Heaths release project in Dorset, and the Wildlife Trusts organisation has sites in Devon and Cornwall where it wishes to release beavers. This week, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Tom Bradshaw, said farmers should be able to kill unruly beavers: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the final control method in place. And if beavers end up in the wrong place, then that lethal control has to be part of being able to have that species reintroduced more widely.\u201d Current plans, published under the previous government, suggest such lethal control will be allowed as a last resort. The Guardian understands that plans to be published imminently will include support for farmers who have their fields inadvertently flooded by beavers. The aim is for the return of beavers to be carefully managed to avoid a negative impact on farming, food production and infrastructure. Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion This policy is almost a decade in the making. The former Tory environment secretary Michael Gove announced a beaver release trial in 2017. In 2020, the results of a trial of wild-living beavers on the River Otter in Devon found they reduced flooding in local settlements and the habitat they created increased biodiversity, as well as the size of local fish. But lobbying from farming groups and landowners has made successive governments nervous to allow the signoff of a release plan. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative peer and former environment minister, had tried when in office to get governments to give the green light to beaver releases. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s great this is finally being resolved. It should never have taken so long. The beaver has a near-magical effect on the environment, retaining water, massively boosting biodiversity and bringing joy to our nature-loving public. Governments are always cautious but the case for beavers couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u201d",

        "text": "Damning National Audit Office report says action is needed to address deficit accumulated under Tory-era policy Almost half of councils in England risk falling into bankruptcy without action to address a \u00a34.6bn deficit amassed under a Conservative-era policy, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has warned. In a damning report, the National Audit Office said that rising pressure on public services and repeated delays to reform the funding of local government meant town halls were in an \u201cunsustainable\u201d financial position. It highlighted failure to reform the funding of special educational needs and disabilities (Send) as one of the most worrying areas where the resources were being outstripped by spiralling costs. The previous government had introduced a scheme known as the \u201cstatutory override\u201d which allowed councils to temporarily keep Send debts off their balance sheets \u2013 in effect papering over the problem. However, the override was planned to end in March 2026, by which point the accumulated deficit for all councils in England is expected to have reached \u00a34.6bn amid ballooning pressures on local authorities. The government says it is in the process of developing a long-term solution. However, the NAO warned failure to address the problem by next March could leave 43% of local authorities at risk of declaring effective bankruptcy. The independent spending watchdog said council funding in recent years had increased but not kept up with demand or complexity of needs. After years of austerity under the Conservatives, more councils in England have declared effective bankruptcy in the past three years than the preceding three decades. While funding from central government grants, council tax and business rates had increased by 4% between 2015-16 and 2023-24 to almost \u00a356bn, funding per person had fallen during the same period by 1%. Over that time councils also made deep cuts to discretionary services \u2013 such as libraries and road maintenance \u2013 while raising spending on adult and children\u2019s social care, which now accounts for 58% of total spending. Earlier this month ministers announced a financial settlement worth more than \u00a369bn for the coming financial year, alongside a sweeping devolution package to reorganise the structure of local government. A form of bailout was also approved for 30 councils, and six were granted permission to raise council tax by more than the usual 5% cap. The NAO said projections show that funding per person is set to increase by 7% by 2025-26. However, the Local Government Association estimates that councils will still face a funding gap of up to \u00a38bn by 2028-29. Gareth Davies, the head of the spending watchdog, said: \u201cThere have been repeated delays to local government finance reform and government can no longer resort to short-term solutions to support local authorities. Action to address this must resolve the systemic weaknesses in local government financial sustainability through a comprehensive, cross-government approach.\u201d A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cThis government is under no illusions about the financial issues facing councils. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reforming the funding system and delivering improved public services across the country.\u201d",

        "text": "With more spending going to defence, the latest budget cut will take Britain\u2019s aid contribution to its lowest for a quarter of a century Keir Starmer\u2019s decision this week to slash Britain\u2019s overseas aid budget and divert to defence spending will take UK aid to developing countries to its lowest level in a generation. It will almost halve the already diminished aid pot, from 0.58% of national income to 0.3%. In 2023, the total aid spend was \u00a315.34bn, almost a third of which was spent on supporting and housing refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. The last time Britain\u2019s aid contribution dropped below 0.3% was a quarter of a century ago, in 1999. Starmer\u2019s move raised concerns among cabinet ministers, who feared it risked reducing soft power and made migration more likely, and outraged humanitarians and aid agencies who warned of a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the world\u2019s poorest. It comes after President Donald Trump\u2019s drastic freeze on USAid spending, prompting warnings that lives would be lost in countries relying on US support. UK overseas aid has historically risen during Labour governments, most noticeably after Tony Blair came to power in 1997 with a pledge to meet the UN\u2019s target of 0.7% of gross national income. The UN general assembly set the target in 1970 for developed countries to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA), to promote the economic development and welfare of poorer nations. The Blair administration, with Gordon Brown as chancellor, set out to reverse a fall in aid spend, from 0.51 in 1979 to 0.27% in 1996, over 18 years of Tory government. Blair set up the Department for International Development (DfID), to focus on reducing poverty, making aid more effective, improving the lives of women and girls and fighting climate change. Blair committed to achieve 0.7% by 2013. The target was enshrined in law in 2015 and was met every year from 2013 to 2020. Other EU countries committed to the 0.7% target by 2015. In 2021, at the height of the Covid pandemic, then prime minister Boris Johnson said the economic impacts at home would result in a temporary reduction in ODA spend to 0.5% of GNI. The previous year, Johnson had controversially merged DfID with the Foreign Office. The Starmer government had committed to restoring the 0.7% spend as soon as fiscal circumstances allowed. In 2023, official figures show the top three country recipients of bilateral aid were Ukraine (\u00a3250m), Ethiopia (\u00a3164m) and Afghanistan (\u00a3115m). Keir Starmer has said the UK will continue to support Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, as well as contribute to climate finance and global health. Regionally, the continent of Africa is the largest regional recipient of UK aid, at \u00a31,229m. The UK\u2019s ODA spend was \u00a315.34bn in 2023. Based on the most recent forecasts for GNI, reducing aid spend to 0.3% in 2027 would take the budget to \u00a39.2bn. Almost a third, 28% or \u00a34.3bn, of aid went on support for refugees or asylum seekers in the UK or other donor countries in 2023, a dramatic rise from the 3.2%, or \u00a3400m, in 2020. Britain\u2019s reported costs for each refugee or asylum seeker is many times that of other major European countries, due in part to a shortage of UK accommodation, leading to the Home Office housing people in hotels. Humanitarian aid (15.3%) and health (13.3%) were the two largest sectors for bilateral aid in 2023, at \u00a3878m and \u00a3764m. Before the pandemic, humanitarian spending was about 15% to 16% of bilateral aid, but was reduced by half in 2021 after the pandemic, to 10.3%, from \u00a31.3bn to \u00a3743m. In 2022 and 2023, the UK provided \u00a3592m to humanitarian crises in Ukraine, after the Russian invasion, and \u00a3467m to Afghanistan, after the Taliban takeover in 2021. It announced an increase in support for victims of the conflict in Sudan in 2025, to \u00a3226.5m. In 2023, the UK gave the fourth highest aid spend in absolute terms and the ninth highest in terms of percentage of GNI.",

        "text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is visiting the White House to try to convince President Donald Trump that peace in Ukraine will endure only if Kyiv and European leaders are at the negotiating table along with Moscow WASHINGTON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit the White House on Thursday to try to convince President Donald Trump that a lasting peace in Ukraine will endure only if Kyiv and European leaders are at the table as negotiations move forward with Moscow. Starmer's trip, coming a few days after French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron's own visit, reflects the mounting concern felt by much of Europe that Trump's aggressive push to find an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine signals his willingness to concede too much to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides,\u201d Trump said Wednesday as he held the first Cabinet meeting of his second term. \u201cFor Ukraine, we\u2019re going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can get as much (land) back as possible.\" But the president's rapprochement with Russia has unsettled America's historic allies in Europe, who have found themselves on their heels with Trump returning to the White House with a determination to dramatically make over U.S. foreign policy to correspond with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d world view. The Trump administration held talks last week with Russia without Ukrainian or other European allies represented. And this week this U.S. refused to sign on to resolutions at the U.N. blaming Russia for the war. The drifting White House view of Ukraine under Trump is leading to a tectonic shift in transatlantic relations. But the administration is pushing back on the notion that Trump is ignoring Europe or that Trump is too eager in his push for settlement talks with Putin. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t conceded anything to anyone,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing the job of a diplomat.\u201d Trump's meeting with Starmer comes a day before he is to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In that meeting Friday, the two are expected to sign off on a contentious agreement that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine's critical minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Zelenskyy had chafed at signing off on an agreement without specific security guarantees from the U.S. But Trump, in announcing plans for the leaders to sign the agreement, was noncommittal about any coming American security guarantees. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make security guarantees ... very much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Europe do that.\u201d Indeed, if a truce can be reached, Starmer and Macron have agreed to dispatch troops for a potential peacekeeping mission to Ukraine to ensure that fighting between Ukraine and Russia doesn't flare up again. The British prime minister confirmed Wednesday that he will host a meeting of international leaders in the U.K. on Sunday, focused on Ukraine. Zelenskyy is expected to attend. Starmer also announced plans this week for the U.K. to bolster defense spending \u2014 an issue that should sit well with Trump, who has been critical that European allies are spending too little on defense. The U.K. government will boost military spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027, years earlier than expected, and will aim to hit 3% by 2035. Beyond the war in Ukraine, Starmer said the talks will home in on \u201ca stable economy, secure borders and national security,\u201d as well as cooperation on AI and other cutting-edge technology. He\u2019ll stress that Europe must \u201cplay its part on global defense and step up for the good of collective European security.\u201d \u201cThe world is becoming ever more dangerous, and it is more important than ever that we are united with our allies,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for us to deepen our special relationship, deliver growth and security, and improve the lives of working people in both our great nations.\u201d Starmer is also keen to discuss \u201cthe opportunities that further technology and AI partnerships could deliver,\u201d his office said, including ambitious but vague \u201cshared moonshot missions across top technologies including quantum and AI, and a deeper partnership on space.\u201d Britain has signaled it aims to eschew the European Union\u2019s high-regulation approach to AI as it seeks to become a leader in the field. The U.K. joined the U.S. in refusing to sign a joint declaration at an artificial intelligence summit hosted by Macron in Paris this month in what was seen as an attempt to curry favor with Washington and seek investment from American tech firms. Starmer\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cwill make the case for further integration between the two countries\u2019 tech sectors to make them the most efficient, ambitious technology sectors in the world.\u201d 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "title": "Trump's firing of military brass prompts concern but little pushback from Republicans - ABC News",
        "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is drawing mixed reactions on Capitol Hill WASHINGTON -- When the Senate unanimously confirmed Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as Air Force chief of staff in 2020, President Donald Trump hailed a \u201chistoric day for America!\u201d on social media and said he was \u201dExcited to work even more closely with Gen. Brown, who is a Patriot and Great Leader!\u201d Trump's Feb. 21 social media post firing Brown, who had since risen to the military's top uniformed officer, was comparatively reserved. The Republican president dismissed Brown, the second African American to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with five other Pentagon officials in a rare move that some critics fear pushes politics into an institution vaunted for its nonpartisanship and adherence to the Constitution. On Capitol Hill, the move drew little criticism from many Republican senators who had once hailed Brown's service to the nation. \u201cMy understanding is the president does have the ability to decide who he wants to be as chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Gen. Brown, I believe, has done an excellent job,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. \"I would\u2019ve been more than happy if the president had left him right in there. But the president has the ability and the authority to make up his own mind as to who he wants,\u201d said Rounds, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., compared the firings to the way President Barack Obama, a Democrat, shook up military leadership as he pursued military gains in Afghanistan. He said he was still trying to understand whether Trump\u2019s dismissals were really without precedent. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be concerned or not, if it\u2019s really far afield from what you normally see in transitions,\u201d Tillis said. Fired alongside Brown were five other top officials: Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead the Navy; Gen. James Slife, the vice chief of the Air Force; and the top judge advocate generals, who advise the military on how to legally conduct their actions, for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. But it was Brown's dismissal that attracted the most attention, given that Trump campaigned heavily on removing \u201cwoke\u201d generals from the military. Brown rose to the job after a career as one of the Air Force\u2019s top aviators, but he drew conservative ire for speaking about his experiences as a Black man in the military after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for about 9 1/2 minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., lambasted Brown's firing. She said the message from the White House to rank-and-file troops is clear: \u201cYour expertise and service is not what\u2019s important. What\u2019s important is your political loyalty to Donald Trump.\u201d Brown was only the second African American to serve as Joint Chiefs chairman, after the late Army Gen. Colin Powell. He was confirmed for the job in 2023 with significant bipartisan support, but few Republicans came to his defense after his firing. Many Republicans emphasized that Trump has the right, as the commander-in-chief, to dismiss Brown. \u201cI think the president is entitled to have his team, including on the Joint Chiefs,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. \u201cAnd I thought the president handled that well, thanked him for service and a distinguished career, but it\u2019s probably time for change.\u201d Hawley did not specify why Brown had to be removed before his four-year tenure as chairman expired but said he expected Trump would provide some explanation. Trump's firings did draw some pushback, if muted. A bipartisan group of House members sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calling for \u201cclear, transparent and apolitical\u201d criteria for the removal of top military officials. \u201cAn apolitical military is an essential component of our democracy and our national security,\u201d wrote a group of six lawmakers that included Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., alongside moderate Democrats. And Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Brown and the other officers fired had been doing a \u201cgood job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s prerogative and I recognize that,\" Collins said. \"But I do not think based on the merits that the decision to fire them was warranted.\u201d Others cheered Trump\u2019s dismissals. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., a former Navy SEAL, slammed the Pentagon's leadership under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, saying \u201cthe folks from that era just need to go away.\u201d \"We need a clean slate at the DOD,\u201d Van Orden said, referring to the Department of Defense. Hegseth, who was confirmed by the Senate as defense secretary in a dramatic tie-breaking vote despite questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon and allegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, has defended Trump's firings. Trump said his nominee to replace Brown will be retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \u201cRazin\u201d Caine, whom Trump first met during a trip to Iraq. Caine is a career F-16 pilot who served on active duty and in the National Guard, notably flying above the nation's capital in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. While Caine's military service includes combat roles in Iraq, special operations postings and positions inside some of the Pentagon\u2019s most classified special access programs, he lacks key assignments that are required by law to serve as Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump can waive those requirements \u2014 but no waiver was required when Brown was confirmed under Biden, as he had fulfilled all the criteria. Caine's lack of command roles is a gap but also gives him more independence than his predecessors, said retired Lt. Gen. Marc Sasseville, who is a friend and flew F-16s on Sept. 11 with Caine. \u201cHe never asked for the job. Never politicked for it,\u201d Sasseville said. \u201cThis is not how he is going to define himself.\u201d But Democratic senators say the firings are an ominous sign, given that Trump has long made clear his desire to involve the military in his domestic policy goals, including his crackdown on immigration. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the firings a \u201ctravesty\u201d that \u201cwill have a ripple effect throughout the military in recruiting and retaining really qualified, able men and women, because it sends a message that political kowtowing to the president is more important than ability and skill.\u201d Blumenthal said Republican colleagues had expressed \u201cdeep misgivings\u201d to him but would not air those concerns publicly. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "text": "Major refugee aid groups say President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appears to be trying to circumvent a federal court ruling this week that blocked his efforts to suspend the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program SEATTLE -- Refugee aid groups said in a federal court filing Thursday that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appears to be trying to circumvent a ruling this week that blocked his efforts to suspend the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle had determined on Tuesday that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, said Trump\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will,\u201d and from the bench, he granted the aid groups\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction blocking Trump\u2019s executive order suspending the refugee resettlement program. He promised a written ruling in the next few days. But Wednesday, aid groups, including Church World Service and the Jewish refugee resettlement organization HIAS, received notifications that their \u201ccooperative agreements\u201d with the State Department had been canceled. The groups on Thursday asked Whitehead for an emergency hearing to discuss the impact of the termination notices, or to make clear that his ruling also applies to those newly issued notices. The groups called the administration\u2019s actions a \u201cflagrant attempt\u201d to evade the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cDefendants are continuing to implement their defunding of the USRAP, and an emergency hearing is necessary to ensure that Defendants are not permitted to evade this Court\u2019s bench ruling and the forthcoming written order with antics designed to confuse the state of play,\u201d the motion said. Whitehead set a hearing for Monday. The State Department acknowledged receipt of an email from The Associated Press about the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, but did not otherwise respond to questions about it. The notices indicated the cooperative agreements with the resettlement agencies were being terminated \u201cfor the convenience of the U.S. Government pursuant to a directive from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for alignment with Agency priorities and national interest.\u201d The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country. Despite longstanding support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year. There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration. Trump's order and the administration's subsequent withholding of funds stranded refugees who had already been approved to come to the U.S., forced the refugee aid groups to lay off staff, and cut off short-term assistance, such as rent, for those who had recently resettled here, the organizations said in the lawsuit challenging the actions. Thursday's filing came the day after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block another court order requiring it to release billions in suspended foreign aid. The administration also outlined plans to cancel more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world. Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition supporting Afghan resettlement efforts, said the termination of the contracts would hurt Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. during its more than two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and are now at risk. They have been resettling in the U.S. via the refugee program as well as the special immigrant visa program. While the special immigrant visa program is still operational, the contract terminations strip away funding that went to helping those who qualified come to America and start new lives here. \u201cNow Afghans are on their own to get here,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake about it, this is a betrayal on par with what we all felt in August of 2021,\u201d he said, referring to the chaotic American withdrawal from Kabul under the Biden administration. ___ Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

I think that is what most Americans want,\u201d Murkowski said in a statement released Wednesday by her publisher, the Penguin Random House imprint Forum Books. Murkowski, a former state lawmaker, was appointed in 2002 by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, to the U.S. Senate seat he\u2019d held before becoming governor. The moderate Republican, who has at times shown a willingness to break with her own party, has over the years built a broad network of support across the state. In 2010, after losing her Republican primary, she went on to keep her seat with a historic write-in campaign. Her most recent election, in 2022, came during the first year that Alaska began using a new elections process that includes open primaries and ranked choice voting in general elections. Since Trump returned to office in January, Murkowski has denounced his decision to pardon the Jan. 6 rioters, opposed his renaming of North America\u2019s tallest peak, in Alaska, from Denali to Mount McKinley and voted against the nominations of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Kash Patel as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

        "text": "A Republican who left the Department of Government Efficiency initiative on President Donald Trump\u2019s first day has launched his bid for Ohio governor COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Vivek Ramaswamy, the Cincinnati-born biotech entrepreneur who departed the Department of Government Efficiency initiative on President Donald Trump's first day, launched his bid for Ohio governor Monday with promises to institute work requirements for Medicaid and merit pay for all public school teachers and administrators. Ramaswamy, 39, kicked off his campaign in Cincinnati, joining the 2026 Republican primary just a month after presumed frontrunner and then-Lt. Gov. Jon Husted left the running to take a U.S. Senate appointment. Ramaswamy sought the GOP nomination for president in 2024 before dropping out to back Trump, who later tapped him to co-chair the efficiency initiative with billionaire Elon Musk. A near-billionaire himself, Ramaswamy has promoted his ties to Trump as he lines up key endorsements and donors in the governor's race, but the president has made no formal endorsement yet. \u201cI spent most of last year working tirelessly to help send Donald Trump back to the White House because it was a fork in the road,\u201d Ramaswamy said to loud cheers from the crowd. \u201cIt was a fork in the road for the future of the country.\u201d Ramaswamy joins a competitive GOP primary field to succeed Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, 78, a veteran center-right politician who is term-limited. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost announced a bid for the seat in January and Heather Hill, a Black entrepreneur from Appalachia, also is running. Dr. Amy Acton, the former state health director who helped lead Ohio through the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, is running as a Democrat. They will compete in a former bellwether state that has tacked reliably red in recent years, having voted for Trump three times by more than 8 percentage points. Republicans also hold every statewide executive office, a majority on the Ohio Supreme Court and supermajorities in both legislative chambers. Ramaswamy told the crowd at his campaign launch that he would \u201cend the war on work\u201d by reattaching work requirements to Medicaid and welfare. He vowed to eliminate income and property taxes, and he promised Ohio would be the first state in the nation to implement merit-based pay for every teacher, principal, superintendent and administrator. He spoke of Ohio's more prosperous days, when he said the state was home to the glass, rubber and steel capitals of the world. This could be the case again, he said, though in other industries like semiconductor production, nuclear energy, biotechnology and bitcoin. \u201cI believe deep in my bones that Ohio can lead the way again,\" he said. \u201cIf Silicon Valley was at the leading edge of the American economy for the last 10 years, it will be the Ohio River Valley for the next 10 years.\u201d Yost issued a statement welcoming Ramaswamy to the race \u201cfor however long he sticks around.\u201d Ramaswamy, who is Hindu, outlined the 10 core beliefs featured in his presidential campaign \u2014 led by \u201cGod is real\u201d followed by \u201cthere are two genders\u201d \u2014 in the 2024 book \u201cTruths: The Future of America First.\u201d He first rose to political prominence with his 2021 book, \u201cWoke Inc: Inside Corporate America\u2019s Social Justice Scam,\u201d a scorching critique of corporations that he said use social justice causes as a smokescreen for self-interested policies. He seeks to buck the traditional route to Ohio's governorship, which runs through extensive government service often stretching decades, and instead mount a Trump-style ascent into the job directly from the business world. The formula has worked for Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump\u2019s endorsement in 2022 and 2024, respectively. But Ramaswamy will test it in a state government-level race for the first time in recent memory. DeWine passed Ramaswamy over to appoint Husted to the Senate seat vacated by Vance, citing Husted\u2019s decades of elective experience. The gubernatorial bid by Husted, a former Ohio House speaker and secretary of state, had locked down many key endorsements and wealthy donors, who are now largely free agents. Yost joined the race as rumors circulated that Ramaswamy was planning a run. Since then, however, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose have endorsed Ramaswamy. ___ Associated Press writer Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report from Honolulu. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "text": "A federal judge has agreed to continue blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s administration from freezing grants and loans potentially totaling trillions of dollars WASHINGTON -- A federal judge agreed Tuesday to continue blocking President Donald Trump's administration from freezing grants and loans potentially totaling trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction requested by groups representing thousands of nonprofits and small businesses. It's the first such order since the Trump administration announced a sweeping pause on federal aid, stirring up a wave of confusion and anxiety across the U.S. The judge said the administration \u201ccannot pretend that the nationwide chaos and paralysis from two weeks ago is some distant memory with no bearing on this case.\u201d \u201cThe relief Plaintiffs now seek is a more durable version of the relief they sought then, when their members were on the brink of extinction,\u201d AliKhan wrote. \u201cIn sum, Plaintiffs have marshalled significant evidence indicating that the funding freeze would be economically catastrophic \u2014 and in some circumstances, fatal \u2014 to their members.\u201d The administration rescinded a memo outlining its planned funding freeze after AliKhan temporarily blocked it earlier this month. A second judge in Rhode Island also issued a temporary restraining order blocking any pause in federal spending pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen states. Last month, the White House said it would temporarily halt federal funding to ensure that the payments complied with Trump\u2019s agenda. Government lawyers argued that the court lacks the constitutional authority to block a funding pause. Organizations represented by the advocacy group Democracy Forward argued that the funding freeze violates their First Amendment rights. Some groups initially said they couldn\u2019t access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. During a hearing last Thursday, however, plaintiffs' attorney Kevin Friedl said the earlier temporary restraining order has \u201cshown its value.\u201d \u201cFunds have been unfrozen.\u201d he told the judge. Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei argued against the preliminary injunction.

        "text": "A group that spent heavily to defeat Trump is now devoting millions to study voters who were once aligned with the Democratic Party but have since strayed. Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The distant past and potential future of the Democratic Party gathered around white plastic folding tables in a drab New Jersey conference room last week. There were nine white men, three in hoodies, two in ball caps, all of them working-class Donald Trump voters who once identified with Democrats and confessed to spending much of their time worried about making enough money to get by. Asked by the focus-group moderator if they saw themselves as middle class, one of them joked, \u201cIs there such a thing as a middle class anymore? What is that?\u201d They spoke about the difficulty of buying a house, the burden of having kids with student loans, and the ways in which the \u201cphony\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d Democratic Party had embraced far-left social crusades while overseeing a jump in inflation. \u201cIt was for the people and everything, and now it is just lies,\u201d one man said when asked how the Democratic Party has changed. Trump, another man said, was the only one inhabiting the political center these days. But some expressed concern about how much they were benefiting from the early days of Trump\u2019s second administration, about the potential cost of new tariffs, and about the president\u2019s embrace of \u201cdistracting\u201d issues such as renaming the Gulf of Mexico and planning to redevelop Gaza. \u201cI feel like the administration is going for things that grab headlines, like trans rights, wars, things that people pay attention to, rather than actual inflation and pricing,\u201d one of the men told the group. \u201cSo that is part of the negativity of politics that I don\u2019t really enjoy.\u201d The February 18 focus group, in a state that saw deep Democratic erosion last year and will elect a new governor this fall, was the first stop of a new $4.5 million research project centered on working-class voters in 20 states that could hold the key to Democratic revival. American Bridge 21st Century, an independent group that spent about $100 million in 2024 trying to defeat Trump, has decided to invest now in figuring out what went wrong, how Trump\u2019s second term is being received, and how to win back voters who used to be Democratic mainstays but now find themselves in the Republican column. \u201cWe want to understand what are the very specific barriers for these working-class voters when it comes to supporting Democrats,\u201d Molly Murphy, one of the pollsters on the project, told me. \u201cI think we want to have a better answer on: Do we have a message problem? Do we have a messenger problem? Or do we have a reach problem?\u201d Mitch Landrieu, a former New Orleans mayor and senior adviser to the Joe Biden White House, said the Democratic Party needs to think beyond the swing voters that were the subject of billions in spending last year and give attention to the people of all races and ethnicities who have firmly shifted away from Democrats to embrace the politics of Trump. \u201cThe first thing you got to do is learn what you can learn, ask what you can ask, and know what you can know,\u201d Landrieu told me last week, before the New Jersey focus group. \u201cWhen you see it through a number of different lenses, it should help you figure out how you got it wrong.\u201d Since losing last fall, Democrats have railed against the price of eggs, denounced \u201cPresident Elon Musk,\u201d and promised to defend the \u201crule of law.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer even led a chant of \u201cWe will win\u201d outside the U.S. Treasury building. But there is still little Democratic agreement about the reasons for Trump\u2019s victory or how Democrats can make their way back to power. The Bridge plan is to launch a series of interviews with party leaders, tracking polls and meetings with voters around the country to try to figure out how best to fix the party after an election that saw Democrats lose the popular vote for the first time since 2004. Former Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez and former Representative Colin Allred of Texas, who lost a bid for Senate last year, have signed up to work with Landrieu on the project. Several other parts of the Democratic power structure are searching for answers as well. The new chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, has promised his own \u201cpostelection review\u201d by the party. \u201cNot an autopsy, because we\u2019re not dead as a party,\u201d he said late last year. The details have not yet been announced. Third Way, a moderate Democratic group, ran a recent Democratic strategist retreat outside Washington to begin the conversation about how to create a new economic agenda and how to extricate the party from unpopular positions on issues such as transgender athletes and immigration enforcement. Future Forward, the largest Democratic independent spender in the 2024 campaign, has continued to circulate \u201cDoppler memos\u201d to Democratic decision makers, offering them real-time updates about how Americans are digesting Trump\u2019s actions and the most promising avenues for pushing back. The Bridge effort emerged from a four-day Palm Beach donor retreat this month, just down the road from Mar-a-Lago. Top Democratic donors gathered for days of closed-door panels with titles such as \u201cWhat Went Wrong?,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Going on With Men?,\u201d \u201cHow to Stop Losing the Culture Wars,\u201d and \u201cSending the Right Message: Reviving the Democratic Brand.\u201d A Saturday-night panel at the conference with Landrieu, Allred, and others laid out how much was still unknown. The title: \u201cIt\u2019s All About Listening: How Can We Reconnect With the Voters We Have Lost?\u201d \u201cI just really believe you have to start from scratch. You have to throw out all of your assumptions,\u201d Landrieu told me. \u201cWhatever happened in the past is the past, and that is the last campaign. Joe Biden isn\u2019t president anymore, and they don\u2019t have Joe Biden as a foil.\u201d Even though the answers remain unclear, donors came away from the retreat saying they were eager to keep spending. Bridge has planned another donor conference in San Francisco for early next month. \u201cAt a time when some Democrats are in retreat, I saw a large group of donors at Democracy Matters in Palm Beach spoiling to re-engage in the fight,\u201d John Driscoll, a health-care executive and an American Bridge donor, said in a statement. The early after-action autopsy of Bridge\u2019s own spending in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania last year echoed the early findings of other groups: Advertising for Kamala Harris and against Trump had a clear marginal impact where it was targeted, but it was unable to hold back the much greater Trump gains, including significant erosion among longtime Democratic voting blocs. A Bridge analysis conducted by the Democratic data firm BlueLabs of voters in the three states found that Democratic support overall dropped 3.9 percentage points in urban counties, 2.5 points in Hispanic-dominant counties, and 2.1 in Black-dominant counties. At the same time, counties where Trump received 60 percent or more of the vote saw their vote totals rise by about 5 percent. Landrieu hopes to share early results before this year\u2019s fall elections so that new tactics and messages get a test run before next year\u2019s midterm elections. After the focus group of white men, Bridge gathered a similar group of eight New Jersey Latino men\u2014Trump-supporting members of the working class who had previously voted for Democrats. One voter said that the Democratic Party has walked away from representing the working class, given rising costs. Another expressed concern about the \u201cwoke\u201d rules of Democratic governance. \u201cPeople were getting hurt for any little comment, so you had to be politically correct for everything,\u201d he said. Democrats have spent years trying to convince nonwhite voters that Trump\u2019s racial insensitivity should be a redline. These voters did not try to defend Trump\u2019s racial views or argue that he is not racist. But even in that was a warning for the next iteration of the Democratic Party. \u201cWhether he is or not, I don\u2019t care,\u201d one voter said. \u201cI vote with my pocket.\u201d More Stories This Is What Happens When the DOGE Guys Take Over Corey Lewandowski Is Too Controversial\u2014Even for Trump",

        "title": "Did Russia Invade Ukraine? Is Putin a Dictator? We Asked Every Republican Member of Congress - The Atlantic",
        "text": "Two simple questions, few straight answers Updated at 4:05 p.m. ET on February 27, 2025 In just three weeks, President Donald Trump has exploded long-standing U.S. foreign policy and sided with Russia against Ukraine and the rest of NATO. He sent American diplomats to open negotiations with Russian counterparts\u2014without inviting Kyiv to participate. He falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia, and echoed the Kremlin line by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cdictator.\u201d Then, in a press conference on Monday, Trump declined to say the same of Vladimir Putin. \u201cI don\u2019t use those words lightly,\u201d he told a reporter. Most Republicans strongly condemned Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and have voted on multiple occasions to send the country military aid. But with their party\u2019s leader back in the White House, many of them have grown quiet. Are any GOP lawmakers willing to say, in plain terms, what is true? I reached out to all 271 Republican members of the House and Senate to find out, asking each of them two straightforward questions: Did Russia invade Ukraine? And is Putin a dictator? So far, I have received 25 responses. Some members were unambiguous: \u201cYes and yes,\u201d a spokesperson for Senator Susan Collins of Maine replied in an email. \u201cVladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator,\u201d read part of the statement from the office of Representative Jeff Hurd of Colorado. Others chose to send excerpts of previous non-answer statements or links to past TV interviews rather than answer either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d A spokesperson for the GOP\u2019s House leader, Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, replied only with a readout of Johnson\u2019s praise for Trump\u2019s dealmaking prowess. A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator. (Still, no straightforward \u201cyes\u201d from Cruz today.) The House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Brian Mast of Florida, opted to stake out a position that seemed different from Trump\u2019s: The panel posted a screenshot of our questions on X, with the caption: \u201cON THE RECORD: Russia invaded Ukraine & Putin is a dictator. But that doesn\u2019t mean our European allies shouldn\u2019t match Russian military spending & recruitment.\u201d (Another post referred to our questions as \u201cBS.\u201d) The Atlantic followed up to ask whether this statement represented Mast\u2019s personal view, but received no further response. Others refused to answer entirely: \u201cDoes the Atlantic believe we\u2019re here to answer gotcha questions to advance narrow opinion journalism?\u201d Jonathan Wilcox, communications director for Representative Darrell Issa of California, said in an email. In fact, it is clearly in the public interest to know how elected officials, particularly those who make decisions about national security, regard foreign powers that have long positioned themselves against the United States. And it is also clearly in the public interest for citizens to know if their representatives\u2019 views have shifted on who is\u2014or is not\u2014a foreign adversary. What follows is the full list of responses from every Republican member of Congress. It will be regularly updated with any additional responses. Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska: A spokesperson pointed to a statement on X from Bacon on February 19, in which he said: \u201cPutin started this war. Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don\u2019t accept George Orwell\u2019s doublethink.\u201d Representative Michael Baumgartner of Washington: \u201cThe Congressman expressed all his thoughts on the Russia-Ukraine War to the Spokane-Review on February 19. He was very clear that Russia and Vladimir Putin were the aggressors of the war in Ukraine,\u201d a spokesman said, adding this link. Senator Susan Collins of Maine: \u201cAs Senator Collins has said multiple times, yes and yes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas: A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator. Senator John Curtis of Utah: A spokesperson pointed to Curtis\u2019s bipartisan resolution supporting Ukraine and a February 25 interview on KSL NewsRadio, in which Curtis said, \u201cUkraine was invaded by a dictator.\u201d Representative Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota: \u201cYes, Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Ukraine and yes, he is a dictator,\u201d the representative told me. \u201cThis war has cost countless lives and destabilized the world. I believe President Trump has the strength and leadership to bring peace and restore stability in a way that puts America\u2019s interests first.\u201d Representative Jeff Hurd of Colorado: \u201cDid Russia invade Ukraine? Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked act of war. Russian President Vladimir Putin is a dictator? Vladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator. It is dishonorable and wrong not to stand up against the tyranny of Putin,\u201d a spokesperson said. Representative Young Kim of California: \u201cYes to both,\u201d a spokesperson said. Representative Mike Lawler of New York: A spokesperson pointed to a recent statement in which Lawler said, \u201cVladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug who clearly started the war in Ukraine.\u201d Representative Brian Mast of Florida: A spokesperson for Mast sent a link to a post on X from the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \u201cON THE RECORD: Russia invaded Ukraine & Putin is a dictator. But that doesn\u2019t mean our European allies shouldn\u2019t match Russian military spending & recruitment. Europe must realize that for our alliance to be the strongest in history, America needs a Europe that can hold its own.\u201d (Another post referred to our questions as \u201cBS\u201dand declaring it would cancel its subscription to our magazine.) Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas: A spokesperson pointed to a statement in which the senator references \u201cPutin\u2019s unjustified invasion of Ukraine,\u201d and confirmed that the senator would call him a dictator. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: A spokesperson sent a link to a statement in which the senator said that Russia launched an \u201cunprovoked war on Ukraine.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cAnd yes, she does believe that Vladimir Putin is a dictator.\u201d Representative Austin Scott of Georgia: \u201cRussia invaded Ukraine and is the aggressor in this war,\u201d the representative told me. \u201cPutin is a dictator who has invaded Ukraine multiple times\u2014this war would end today if he would pull his troops back into Russia.\u201d Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi: A spokesperson pointed to previous statements in which Wicker said Russia invaded Ukraine and called Putin \u201ca war criminal who should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.\u201d Senator Todd Young of Indiana: \u201cYes and yes,\u201d a spokesperson said. Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas: A spokesman provided a link to an interview with Piers Morgan in which Crenshaw cautioned against returning to a pre\u2013World War II order allowing \u201cdictators to conquer other countries and take their stuff.\u201d Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio: A spokesperson said the representative declined to comment. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa: \u201cLike all Americans, Ernst wants to see an end to Putin\u2019s unjust war that has cost far too many lives,\u201d a spokesperson said. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia: A spokesperson said: \u201cThese questions are ridiculous. I\u2019d advise you to search Congresswoman Greene\u2019s X page.\u201d Representative French Hill of Arkansas: A spokesperson did not address the question of whether Putin is a dictator, but sent a link to an Arkansas PBS interview in which the representative said, \u201cThis war was started by Vladimir Putin,\u201d and that \u201cUkraine has to be at the table\u201d for any peace deal. Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan: A spokesperson pointed to a statement from the congressman acknowledging the invasion and encouraging peace, but did not answer whether Putin is a dictator. Representative Darrell Issa of California: A spokesperson said, \u201cDoes the Atlantic believe we\u2019re here to answer gotcha questions to advance narrow opinion journalism?\u201d Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana: A spokesperson sent over Johnson\u2019s recent comments during this week\u2019s GOP leadership press conference about Trump\u2019s dealmaking skills and his desire for peace in Ukraine, but did not answer either question directly. Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania: A spokesperson pointed to two recent statements by Perry regarding Ukraine and Russia, but did not answer the questions directly. Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama: A spokesperson did not answer directly but sent a link to an interview with Newsmax, in which the senator said, \u201cPresident Trump is not a Putin apologist.

        "title": "The Adolescent Style in American Politics - The Atlantic",
        "text": "The version of manhood placed on display by Trump and his aides is the one imagined by teenage boys. Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. To a certain kind of guy, Donald Trump epitomizes masculine cool. He\u2019s ostentatiously wealthy. He\u2019s married to his third model wife. He gets prime seats at UFC fights, goes on popular podcasts, and does more or less whatever he wants without consequences. That certain kind of guy who sees Trump as a masculine ideal? That guy is a teenage boy. Much has been written about Trump\u2019s widening appeal to men, and to young men in particular. MAGA, the story goes, is making masculinity great again. But the version of manhood on display not just from Trump but from many of his closest advisers and appointees isn\u2019t the kind of traditional manhood championed by his vice president, J. D. Vance; it\u2019s a manhood imagined by adolescent boys. (Although of course, plenty of adolescent boys do not look up to Trump.) And at his core, Trump is an adolescent president, surrounded by adolescent flunkies, cheered into office by adolescent men. Tom Nichols: Donald Trump, the most unmanly president Adolescence, the transition period from childhood into adulthood, is a time of rapid brain development. The frontal cortex, the part of the brain that regulates impulse control and future planning, is last to mature. Lawrence Steinberg, a psychology professor at Temple University and widely recognized expert on adolescent development, explained adolescence to me as \u201ca developmental mismatch between the development of the brain systems that are used for self-control and self-regulation, and the development of the brain systems that respond to reward and that generate emotions and perhaps lead to impulsive behavior.\u201d Picture that reward response as an upside-down U: It grows as a child does, hitting its apex around 19 or 20, and then decreases in adulthood. This, Steinberg says, is part of why adolescents (and adolescent boys in particular) are such notorious risk takers: That reward center is so arousable in middle to late adolescence that it overrides the system regulating self-control\u2014a system that is itself slower to develop. Adolescence has not historically been a developmental stage we culturally valorize. In the MAGA movement, though, an adolescent way of moving through the world\u2014high-risk, low-regulation, near-total disinhibition\u2014characterizes leaders and thrills followers. Cultures differ in how they distinguish between manhood and boyhood, but the reward-seeking, risk-eschewing, low-self-control aspects of adolescence transcend countries and cultures, Steinberg said. In the United States, manhood in a traditional sense has been distinguished from boyhood and adolescence partly by virtue and obligation: Boys may be boys and teenagers may run around thrill-seeking, but real men are expected to provide for themselves and their families, protect those they love, and demonstrate a kind of moral fortitude that justifies their familial and social authority. There are all kinds of problems with this traditional model, and feminists like myself are among the first to point them out. The masculinity of MAGA, though, is far worse: It rejects commitment and virtue, but still demands power and respect\u2014it is, as Jamelle Bouie put it in The New York Times, \u201cthe masculinity of someone unburdened by duty, obligation or real responsibility.\u201d We don\u2019t see this sort of masculinity only from Trump. Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed as defense secretary by the narrowest margin in history, says he wants a military full of men who are uninhibited \u201cwarriors,\u201d free of any attempt to impose moral order on the teen and 20-something men who generally do the nation\u2019s fighting. His book The War on Warriors argues that while \u201cour warriors\u201d were \u201cbusy killing Islamists in shithole countries,\u201d liberals insisting on diversity initiatives were ruining the country and lawyers insisting that soldiers abide by the rules of war were ruining the military. During Hegseth\u2019s confirmation hearings, when Senator Angus King asked him if the Geneva Conventions should be observed, Hegseth dodged. \u201cWe don\u2019t need burdensome rules of engagement that make it impossible for us to win these wars,\u201d he said. In his telling, \u201cwarriors\u201d should operate with pure aggression; restraint is weakness. He evinces a similar lack of continence in his personal life. Hegseth is currently married to the woman he impregnated while still married to his second wife, who herself was the mistress he married after cheating on his first wife. Life is complicated, and marriage more complicated still. But a series of extramarital affairs\u2014something that also characterizes the president\u2019s personal life\u2014is not typically the mark of a respectable, responsible adult man. Elon Musk, more keyboard warrior than hardened soldier, is cut from similar cloth. He, too, has fathered many children with many different women. And he, too, seeks power without responsibility. He has put himself in charge of reforming the entirety of the federal government, one of the largest and most complex bureaucracies in the world, despite not growing up in the U.S. and having no government experience. Arrogance is one word for this; delusion is perhaps another. His effort has so far been an abject disaster. But it\u2019s easy to see a teenager\u2019s bravado in his actions\u2014the lack of self-control and self-awareness, the inability to grasp what one may be incapable of doing. Musk is notorious for sharing edgelord memes on X, the kinds of things that might be passed around by teenage boys. He also has a remarkably juvenile sense of humor. For example, he edited the X bio of the Canadian Broadcast Corporation to say it is 69 percent government-funded (69, get it?). He recently changed his name on the same platform to \u201cHarry Bolz.\u201d His Department of Government Efficiency is itself named after an internet meme about a shiba inu. He proposed \u201ca literal dick-measuring contest\u201d with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He bought Twitter and turned it into X after being annoyed by its moderation policies, which he compared to censorship, but once in charge, he experienced serial emotional meltdowns over content he didn\u2019t like, some of which he then censored. He has gone on sprees of banning accounts that offended him in some way, while allowing white supremacists and Nazis to proliferate on the site. He often communicates on X using video-game jargon, the lingua franca of teenage boys. Tom Nichols: The great manliness flip-flop Stephen Miller, the Trump whisperer who has long shaped much of his boss\u2019s immigration policy, was an actual adolescent when he ran for high-school student government and asked, \u201cAm I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?!\u201d (In defense of adolescents, his peers booed him offstage). As a fully grown adult, he may no longer be the leader of the \u201cMom, Make My Bed\u201d caucus, but he remains just as petulant, and seems just as tickled by the teenage penchant for provocation. At a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, he echoed the notorious Nazi slogan \u201cGermany for Germans only\u201d when he bellowed, \u201cAmerica for Americans only!\u201d He has also been instrumental in slamming the door shut not just to migrants, but to refugees\u2014even though Miller\u2019s own grandfather sought refuge in the U.S. from the anti-Jewish pogroms of Eastern Europe. As these psychologically adolescent men work together, they fuel one another\u2019s worst impulses. Much of Steinberg\u2019s work is research on juvenile offenders; adolescent boys and young men, according to crime statistics, commit a hugely disproportionate number of crimes. \u201cAnd they commit their crimes in groups, disproportionately,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re with their buddies, their tendency to engage in reckless and risky behavior is amplified.\u201d This is both a result of peer-pressure dynamics\u2014kids who might not otherwise behave badly are pushed to by friends\u2014and a kind of mutually escalating group dynamic. The realities of human group behavior, so magnified in adolescence, mean that the teen spirit of the Trump administration may animate even those men who might not have otherwise behaved similarly. Zuckerberg, with his gold chain and Shaggy haircut, seems to have embraced dressing like a teenager at roughly the same time that his politics shifted rightward. He attended Trump\u2019s inauguration last month, and blamed former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg for the company\u2019s efforts to create a more inclusive workplace. Zuckerberg\u2019s image has, until now, been fairly straitlaced, standard-issue nerdy, and moderately liberal. But he recently went on \u00fcber-bro Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to complain that the corporate world was \u201cpretty culturally neutered\u201d and getting too far from the \u201cmasculine energy\u201d and \u201caggression\u201d men need to thrive. Perhaps this midlife return to the trappings of adolescence was an inevitable evolution for a Millennial man whose success came so early and so spectacularly, catapulting him into the world of serious adults before he was completely ready. But it\u2019s also not difficult to speculate that our immature cultural moment\u2014spurred on by Trump\u2019s reelection\u2014\u2013is what turned Zuckerberg, whom Musk not so long ago derided as \u201cZuck the cuck,\u201d from a naive techno-optimist 20-something into a middle-aged man in a gold chain opining about masculine energy. As each of us moves through the world, we engage in a regular internal, often unconscious calculus of risk versus reward. Young adults overindex on the potential for good stuff to result from the risks they take, and underindex on potential adverse consequences. This kind of impulsiveness also seems evident in the early acts of the Trump administration. When Trump is given the freedom to speak off-the-cuff, he often makes pronouncements that his team later has to walk back, as he recently did when saying that the Palestinians should leave Gaza so that the Strip might be turned into a Riviera of luxury condos. It wasn\u2019t that the thought just popped into his head\u2014Trump\u2019s statement had sufficient detail to suggest that it was something he had discussed before his press conference\u2014but it seemed clear enough that, to the president, the risks of announcing a half-baked plan (not to mention the risks of the plan itself) paled in comparison to the potential payoffs, which largely amounted to attention. The skills of adult life\u2014emotional continence, more accurate risk perception, self-control, greater precision in future forecasting\u2014are developed in adolescence through physical changes in the brain and body systems, but also through guidance and experience. As anyone who ever had a great but demanding high-school athletic coach can tell you, many teenagers (and most children) have a seemingly inherent desire for authority figures to help contain them as they live with underdeveloped brains and raging hormones. Adulthood in America has been pushed back: Young people are marrying later, procreating later, and buying their homes later, if they do any of those things at all. It\u2019s perhaps not a coincidence that in this era of extended adolescence, a great many unmoored men are, like teenage boys looking to the coach for guidance, seeking straight-talking male authority figures to teach them how to be men. They\u2019re apparently finding these father figures on YouTube, podcasts, and social media\u2014and in the MAGA movement. Take the author Jordan Peterson. Peterson is notorious for his misogyny and conservatism, but much of his work is focused on self-improvement\u2014and specifically on how young men can impose discipline on their lives. \u201cParents, universities and the elders of society have utterly failed to give many young men realistic and demanding practical wisdom on how to live,\u201d David Brooks said in explaining his appeal. \u201cPeterson has filled the gap.\u201d Peterson tells young men to stand up straight. He orders them to make their beds. He says to turn off the porn, get a job, and take responsibility for their life. A slew of other leading male podcasters\u2014Andrew Huberman, Tim Ferriss, even Joe Rogan\u2014take similar self-improvement tacks. And young men eat it up. They seem hungry for betterment, but also for an authoritative figure to just tell them what to do. Some have turned their sights to Trump. The president embodies both the aspirational adulthood that is the stuff of teenage fantasies (private jets, models, two Big Macs for dinner), and the punishing father who men wise enough to understand their own need for greater discipline imagine will whip everyone into shape. At a Trump rally in Georgia, Tucker Carlson offered this disciplinarian-daddy vision of Trump\u2019s return to the White House: \u201cDad comes home,\u201d Carlson told the crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed. Dad is pissed. And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? \u2018You\u2019ve been a bad girl. You\u2019ve been a bad little girl, and you\u2019re getting a vigorous spanking right now.\u2019\u201d The crowd broke into a chant of \u201cDaddy\u2019s home!\u201d Mel Gibson used the same metaphor after Trump visited a fire-ravaged Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s like Daddy arrived and he\u2019s taking his belt off,\u201d he said. The phrase is so ubiquitous in MAGA circles that Roseanne Barr, donning blond dreadlocks and heavily reliant on Auto-Tune, recorded a postelection rap titled \u201cDaddy\u2019s Home.\u201d You can buy Daddy\u2019s Home T-shirts with Trump on them at Walmart. From the January 2025 issue: Misogyny comes roaring back The reality of governance by teen boy, though, may be less \u201cDaddy\u2019s home\u201d and more Lord of the Flies. Steinberg, the psychology professor, was clear that he couldn\u2019t diagnose Trump, Trump\u2019s lackeys, or anyone else he hadn\u2019t examined. But he told me, \u201cMaybe what characterizes Trump more than anything else is the very heightened reward-seeking. He just has to get rewards from everything he does. And that may generate very strong impulses that he follows.\u201d Whatever self-control the president does possess may simply be insufficient to tamp down those impulses. The kind of behavior Trump demonstrates, Steinberg said, is unusual. \u201cYou need to distinguish between the people who are behaving this way where we would kind of expect it, although maybe not as extreme as this\u201d\u2014actual teenagers\u2014\u201cand people who keep behaving this way long after we would have expected them to have matured,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chances that these people are going to mature in ways that we see as normal development, I think, are very small. They would have reached adult levels of maturity by the time they\u2019ve reached their late 20s or early 30s, and if they haven\u2019t, I think they\u2019re probably not going to.\u201d What does this mean for the nation Trump leads? Steinberg was careful, again, to emphasize that he isn\u2019t in the business of diagnosing strangers, and that Trump is not in fact an adolescent boy. But, he said, \u201cif I asked the average person, \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to have a 17-year-old running the country?,\u2019 I don\u2019t think most people would say yes. If I said, \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea to have an adult who acts like a 17-year-old running the country?,\u2019 I think they\u2019d say that sounds like a pretty bad idea also.\u201d Yet a plurality of voters cast their ballots for Trump, so all of us are now finding out just how bad of an idea it is.

Listen to more stories on hark This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here. A quarter century ago, Vladimir Putin gathered 21 of Russia\u2019s top oligarchs in the Kremlin to let them know that he, not they, held power in Russia. The young Russian president (not yet for life) informed them that they could keep the wealth they\u2019d amassed if they complied with his political goals. Partnership with Putin held out the prospect of safety, and even greater riches. \u201cWe received confirmation,\u201d an attendee named Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky said, \u201cthat the development of Russian business is one of the state\u2019s top priorities.\u201d Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. Most of the oligarchs submitted, but those who didn\u2019t went to prison or into exile, lest they fall prey to the country\u2019s epidemic of window-plunging deaths. (Khodorkovsky was imprisoned, putatively for fraud and tax evasion, but really for supporting independent media and opposition parties.) Since then, affinity for Putin has been a sine qua non of high-level economic success in Russia. An eerily reminiscent scene played out late last year at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump\u2019s Winter Palace, where Stephen Miller, one of Trump\u2019s loyalty enforcers, met with Meta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. The weather was more pleasant, and presumably neither party contemplated defenestration as a settlement alternative, but many other details seemed to echo. \u201cMr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s terms,\u201d The New York Times reported. Because Trump had recently warned, \u201cWe are watching [Zuckerberg] closely, and if he does anything illegal\u201d during Trump\u2019s second term, \u201che will spend the rest of his life in prison,\u201d this opportunity must have sounded enticing. Zuckerberg indicated that he would not in any way obstruct Trump\u2019s agenda, according to the Times, and foisted blame for any prior offenses onto subordinates. By the time Trump assumed power, Zuckerberg was lavishing him with praise. \u201cWe now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies,\u201d he gushed of the man who had once threatened him with prison, \u201cthat prioritizes American technology winning. And that will defend our values and interests abroad.\u201d His rehabilitation complete, Zuckerberg assumed a place of pride at Trump\u2019s inauguration, alongside Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and other titans of industry. His eyes were now on the future, and the promised Trumpian Golden Age. The president\u2019s public communion with the business titans who have submitted to him has been analyzed as a signal of his authoritarianism and his alliance with the rich. But it also reveals another emerging aspect of Trumpism: his rejection of the capitalist principles that ultimately generate prosperity. Trump has never believed in the invisible hand\u2014in leaving people alone to pursue self-interest in a free market; in letting market forces allocate capital and arbitrate any given company\u2019s success or failure. Nor does he even believe in traditional mercantilist protection. He believes, like Putin, in political control of the economy\u2019s commanding heights\u2014success for those executives and companies who please him, failure for those who don\u2019t. And he seems to be seeking that control more actively than he did in 2016. Already, Trump\u2019s words and actions have brought about a psychological transformation within the executive class. Presidents and business leaders have sometimes tangled, or formed partnerships, but the combination of fear and solicitousness that Trump now commands is wholly new. After the election, The Wall Street Journal reported, businesses began looking at steps such as \u201cbuying the Trump family\u2019s cryptocurrency token\u201d and scrubbing their websites of Democratic-friendly language. Stanley Black & Decker took down an old post-insurrection statement saying it would \u201cuse our voice to advocate for our democracy and a peaceful transition of power,\u201d and donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. A steel executive hoping to win Trump\u2019s approval to purchase U.S. Steel held a press conference in Butler, Pennsylvania\u2014a holy site in the MAGA universe since the assassination attempt at a rally there in July\u2014where he declared, \u201cAmerica First!\u201d Bezos has not renewed his financial support for the Science Based Targets initiative, which works with businesses looking to cut emissions. After Trump gave Musk, the largest donor to his campaign, a limitless portfolio to reshape federal policy, businesses began to see Musk\u2019s commercial empire as a route to political favor too, as the Financial Times noted in February. Visa struck a payment-processing deal with Musk\u2019s controversial social-media site, X, while Amazon boosted its planned marketing there. Musk\u2019s former rivals hastily reconsidered their rivalries: JPMorganChase dropped a lawsuit against Tesla (the company said the timing was coincidental), and Jamie Dimon announced on CNBC that he had \u201chugged it out\u201d with Musk after a long feud. The Journal, as America\u2019s most prominent business paper, has documented this cultural transformation in remarkably clear terms. Sentences like this began appearing regularly after the election: \u201cExecutives across the corporate sphere are working to get in the good graces of the new administration\u201d (November). \u201cTitans of the business world are rushing to make inroads with the president-elect, gambling that personal relationships with the next occupant of the Oval Office will help their bottom lines and spare them from Trump\u2019s wrath\u201d (December). \u201cCompanies seeking Trump\u2019s favor have plenty to gain\u201d (January). The newspaper that American capitalists consult to find out how to run their businesses is informing them that they must gain Trump\u2019s favor if they want to get ahead. It would be naive to depict this behavior as totally novel. For decades, big companies have spent great sums on lobbying, and their executives have long made pilgrimages to Washington to advance their interests. And they\u2019ve often gotten results. But Trump appears to be ushering in a change not only in the degree of government favoritism, but also in kind. And the velocity of the transformation, coming as it does alongside a cascade of tumbling norms, can obscure how differently he is operating. The change can be seen most blatantly in the media industry, which has drawn Trump\u2019s gaze more than any other. Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, and Patrick Soon-Shiong, who owns the Los Angeles Times, spiked endorsements of Kamala Harris, claiming they would give off the appearance of bias, but then after the election made personal statements praising Trump or his Cabinet picks, as if that somehow wouldn\u2019t. Since then, several major companies have settled lawsuits that Trump had brought against them, and that likely would have been defeated if not laughed out of court. ABC, owned by Disney, donated $15 million to Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle his complaint that George Stephanopoulos had described Trump as having been found liable for rape (he was found liable for sexual abuse). After incoming Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr warned Paramount executives that their merger bid could be at risk because of Trump\u2019s anger at CBS, which Paramount owns, the network reportedly began talks to settle a frivolous $10 billion lawsuit complaining that 60 Minutes had edited out unflattering portions of its interview with Harris. Even after the presiding judge expressed extreme skepticism at the merits of Trump\u2019s lawsuit against Meta for suspending him from Facebook after the January 6 insurrection\u2014a right it clearly possessed as a private entity\u2014Zuckerberg offered up $25 million in penance. Read: Trump says the corrupt part out loud Putting the screws to media owners in particular, especially early on, seems to follow the same playbook that Putin and other strongmen have used to consolidate their power. So does finding opportunities for personal enrichment along the way. (Putin, a lifelong public servant, has become one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men.) Filing weak or groundless lawsuits and expecting his targets to settle for fear of government retribution appears to be a perfectly legal way for Trump to collect baksheesh. Although Trump has so far devoted the most attention to media businesses, he has not ignored the broader economy. Every economic-policy decision he makes is a potential weapon to punish dissent or reward his friends, beginning with tariffs. David Frum: The price America will pay for Trump\u2019s tariffs Trump has never described himself as a free-market purist, and his enthusiasm for levying imports is his best-known deviation from his party\u2019s traditional economic philosophy. This impulse is often described as a protectionist instinct, aimed at helping shield key industries or American businesses generally. But in fact, Trump\u2019s tariff strategy, if you want to call it that, hardly advances any coherent economic goal. He has threatened tariffs on countries for non-economic reasons, and levied tariffs on industrial inputs, such as aluminum and copper, that make American industries less, not more, competitive by raising their costs. Trump apparently believes that tariffs are borne by foreigners, and are therefore an untapped source of free money from overseas. He enjoys the idea of using them as levers to extract diplomatic concessions as well. But Trump has also used tariffs to gain personal and political leverage over American businesses. During his first term, Trump levied broad tariffs and then entertained a parade of executives pleading for exemptions, which his administration doled out at its whim. The Office of the United States Trade Representative fielded more than 50,000 requests from domestic businesses for exceptions to the tariffs on Chinese goods alone, while the Commerce Department sifted through almost half a million waiver requests. Trump\u2019s decisions were often arbitrary\u2014Bibles got a tariff exception, on the apparent basis that their costs needed to stay low, but textbooks did not. One study of the exceptions, published by the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, found that firms that had donated to Trump or hired staff from his administration were more likely to receive tariff exceptions. The tariffs, and the ability to hand out exceptions without any oversight or method, were \u201ca very effective spoils system allowing the administration of the day to reward its political friends and punish its enemies,\u201d the authors concluded. A 2019 investigation by the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general reported \u201cthe appearance of improper influence in decision-making\u201d in the waiver process. In his second term, Trump has managed to solve this problem\u2014if you define problem as the exposure of corruption rather than its existence\u2014by firing, to date, the inspectors general at 18 federal agencies, including Commerce. Trump\u2019s greatest advantage in this regard is that he has never professed adherence to any standard of fairness. When he discusses his plans to regulate businesses, or reward them with tax breaks, he does so in nakedly transactional terms. The business community understands that every decision the federal government makes, whether it involves antitrust enforcement or taxation or criminal justice, will be meted out on the basis of Trump\u2019s political and personal whims. Trump does not even pretend otherwise, because the pretense would undermine his power. Presidents may not be angels. But they used to follow a general presumption of leaving the task of picking winners and losers to the private sector. They likewise observed a wall between public and private interest that we can barely recognize today. Seventy-two years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower selected Charlie Wilson, the head of General Motors, as his defense secretary. Skeptical members of Congress quizzed Wilson as to how he would put aside residual loyalty to his former company. Wilson confessed, \u201cFor years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.\u201d The confession scandalized the country. Although Wilson was trying to say that General Motors benefited from national prosperity, the very possibility that he might conflate the interests of his former employer with those of the country was beyond the pale. From the April 2018 issue: Is Big Business really that bad? At the moment, large swaths of government policy are being dictated by the current CEO of a car company. And yet it is unfathomable that the Trump administration would deem Elon Musk\u2019s dual role unethical, let alone demand that he step down from Tesla and his other companies as a condition of public service. Musk, like Trump, respects no distinction between his personal financial interests, those of his political party, and those of the country. The seamless connection between political power and personal wealth tells everybody who belongs to the upper class or aspires to it that their safest path is to join the ruling claque. This is alarming for any number of reasons. But, not least among them, it violates the key precept of any free-enterprise system: that market competition dictates which businesses succeed or fail. Through innovation and creative destruction, this kind of competition yields national prosperity. The nature of Trump\u2019s economic vision\u2014populist? nationalist? traditional conservative?\u2014has been the subject of endless debate. The reality is that he brings together the least attractive elements of capitalism and socialism, fusing heavy-handed state control with high inequality, and entrenching a set of oligarchs who serve simultaneously as the ruling party\u2019s victims and co-conspirators. The more that political favor displaces market competition as the basis of corporate success, the worse things will get. It may seem to Americans influenced by Trump\u2019s well-crafted persona as a business genius or lulled by the record of his first term (when he inherited a growing economy) that he will bring some pro-business magic to his second term. Yet favoring incumbent businesses (as long as they stay on his good side) is not the same as favoring healthy free markets. Putin is in some ways a great ally of Russian business, and the country\u2019s economic elite supports him, but Russia\u2019s economy should be seen by intelligent advocates of capitalism as a vision of hell. The end point of Trump\u2019s vision for the economy would be unrecognizable to generations of innovators. It would sacrifice the openness and opportunity that make America the most enticing destination for entrepreneurs across the world, while locking into place and even celebrating excesses of wealth. If Americans think that by empowering Trump, they have traded away some of their equality, civic decency, and political freedom for prosperity, we may find one day that we have sacrificed them all.

        "title": "Trump\u2019s Military Purge Has Washington Asking \u2018Who\u2019s Next?\u2019 - The Atlantic",
        "text": "The president fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as part of a stunning shake-up across the military\u2019s senior ranks. President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of the country\u2019s most senior military officer on Friday night rattled the foundations of the armed forces. It also intensified an already furious game of \u201cwho\u2019s next\u201d among senior lawmakers and Washington officials, who have been trading information about the commander in chief\u2019s likely targets. Trump fired Air Force General Charles Q. Brown Jr., known as C. Q., who was only the second African American to serve as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president then tapped a relatively unknown officer to replace him\u2014retired three-star Air Force General Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, who reportedly impressed the president with his swagger and bravado when they met in Iraq in 2018. Brown\u2019s dismissal, coupled with Caine\u2019s improbable elevation, added to a sense of bewilderment that has prevailed across the national-security establishment in recent days, as the administration purges the upper echelons of career officers and civil servants. Trump also appears poised to remove several other top military leaders\u2014focusing on Black and women officers\u2014and replace them with his handpicked successors. And at the FBI, the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence agencies, senior officials, as well as personnel who had only been on the job a few years, were bracing to be fired, multiple officials have told us. Many of the personnel actions seemed aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to rid the ranks of \u201cwoke\u201d officials whom the president thinks were promoted not because of their credentials, but due to their race or gender. At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that he was replacing Admiral Lisa Franchetti, who is the first woman to serve as the chief of naval operations, as well as General James Slife, the vice chief of the Air Force. A draft list of other officers who might be fired circulated this week on Capitol Hill among a small number of lawmakers on the armed-services committees in the House and Senate. The list isn\u2019t final and is subject to the whims of the president and the defense secretary, cautioned two people familiar with it, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters Brown and Franchetti are on the list, as are other senior officers. A White House official told us that the futures of those officers were being evaluated but that the president hadn\u2019t made a final decision. A list has also circulated with the names of officers who might be promoted to replace those being removed. People who know those officers told us many were highly capable, and that they were serving in roles meant to groom them for promotion. But moving them up the ranks now was potentially premature and a break with military protocol. If confirmed by the Senate, Caine\u2019s appointment would break with a generation of norms and traditions governing promotion in the senior ranks of the military. In nearly 30 years, no one has risen to chairman without first serving as a member of the Joint Chiefs. Caine, who retired last year, would leapfrog all of the current members. Nothing in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 suggests that he was destined to become the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. armed forces. He has not commanded a large number of troops. He has never led a branch of the military. His last job was as associate director for military affairs for the CIA, from 2021 to 2024. The job is a liaison position that has more clout inside the Pentagon than it does at Langley. One thing Caine apparently did have going for him: a memorable encounter he reportedly had with Trump. According to a New York Times profile, Caine impressed the president when they met, in 2018, because he claimed that the Islamic State could be defeated in a week, not two years, as Trump said his advisers had told him. Trump has told the story on different occasions, and while the details have changed, the conversation stuck in his memory. As, apparently, did Caine. In a statement, Hegseth indicated that the military purge was not limited to top leaders, noting that the Pentagon was \u201crequesting nominations\u201d for judge advocates general\u2014lawyers\u2014for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado and former Army Ranger, wrote on X that \u201cthe purge of senior officers at [the Department of Defense] is deeply troubling, but purging JAG officers worries me the most.\u201d Those lawyers, he noted, interpret the law and determine the constitutionality of actions that commanders take. Replacing those officers with \u201cloyalists is so dangerous,\u201d Crow said. During his first term, Trump intervened in several military justice cases that revolved around the line between acceptable combat behavior and war crimes. In the most infamous, he reversed a decision to demote Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who had been convicted of posing with the dead body of an Islamic State prisoner. (Gallagher had been found not guilty of the prisoner\u2019s murder.) Trump\u2019s decision allowed Gallagher to retire as a SEAL. Challenged by then\u2013Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley about the importance of military ethics and laws to combat troops, Trump responded that he didn\u2019t understand \u201cthe big deal,\u201d according to Milley\u2019s recounting of the conversation to The Atlantic. \u201cYou guys are all just killers,\u201d Trump said, according to Milley. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d",

        "text": "The president sees himself as national king, and every other American\u2014including Maine Governor Janet Mills\u2014as one of his quavering subjects. Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The Trump administration is enmeshed in a long and rapidly growing list of legal challenges to the novel powers it has claimed for itself. But to try to understand the situation in terms of the individual cases, and the legal questions they implicate, is to miss the forest for the trees. The larger picture is that Donald Trump refuses, or is simply unable, to grasp any distinction between the law and his own whims. That conflation was on display once again today at a meeting of governors at the White House. As Trump lectured the audience on his executive order banning transgender girls and women from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports, he paused to single out Maine Governor Janet Mills. \u201cAre you not going to comply with it?\u201d he demanded of her. \u201cI\u2019m complying with state and federal laws,\u201d she replied. To this, Trump shot back, \u201cWe are the federal law.\u201d It is entirely possible that, if the state of Maine challenges the executive order, Trump will prevail legally. But what is important about this exchange is not whose interpretation of Title IX and the Administrative Procedure Act has a better chance to win five votes on the Supreme Court. It is that Trump is treating the law as coterminous with his own desires. Trump then threatened Mills with the prospect of stripping away federal funding for her state: \u201cYou better do it, because you\u2019re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don\u2019t.\u201d Legally, it is possible for the federal government to deny states certain funding streams under certain conditions. But Trump cannot simply cut Maine off financially because the state chooses to challenge a federal policy. Distinctions like this, however, seem totally lost on the president, who sees himself as national king\u2014note his use of the royal we\u2014and every other American, including each of the 50 states, as one of his quavering subjects. Jonathan Chait: Trump says the corrupt part out loud Trump has grown ever more brazen about his belief that his activities are by definition legal, and activities he opposes by definition criminal. That belief is implied by a long, long list of statements and actions, stretching from his career in business, when he routinely treated laws (forbidding him from discriminating against Black tenants or committing tax fraud) as suggestions; to the final days of his presidency, when he attempted to overturn his election defeat; to his post-presidency, when he flagrantly disregarded requirements that he turn over classified documents. It is also implied by his habit of describing a long list of political opponents as criminals. Trump recently summarized this belief by writing on X, \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d (The possibly apocryphal quote is commonly attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, who was, famously, a dictator.) His statement to Mills is utterly consistent with this belief: Since Trump cannot violate the law, it follows that the law means whatever he says. He has progressed from demonstrating his disregard for the law to stating it as a doctrine. Trump\u2019s supporters have followed his lead. When the White House announced a spending freeze last month, Matthew J. Vaeth, acting director of Trump\u2019s budget office, wrote, \u201cCareer and political appointees in the Executive Branch have a duty to align Federal spending and action with the will of the American people as expressed through Presidential priorities.\u201d Of course, the Constitution does not say that the will of the people is expressed exclusively through the president. It divides legitimate authority between three branches of government, resting the spending authority in the hands of Congress. Paula White, the newly appointed White House faith adviser, has gone further, once stating, \u201cTo say no to President Trump would be saying no to God.\u201d Far from reassuring the American people that they continue to live in a democratic republic, Trump and the White House have lately leaned into the divine-right theme with a series of social-media posts depicting Trump as a king for overruling New York City\u2019s congestion-pricing system. David A. Graham: The world\u2019s most powerful unelected bureaucrat Last week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which has occasionally scolded Trump for his naughtiness, dismissed fears that the country is entering a constitutional crisis as \u201coverwrought.\u201d Trump, the editors insisted, was merely testing the bounds of his executive authority, in this case by destroying a series of federal programs and agencies authorized by Congress. It is true, as the Journal argues, that previous presidents have tested the boundaries of their authority. But there is a point at which the executive branch moves so far and so fast that the eventual promise of legal redress means little. If you fire all the employees of a department and cancel its contractors, they\u2019ll go broke waiting for the Supreme Court to rule in their favor. Imagine a Democratic administration setting out to replace every white Evangelical church in America with EV-charging stations\u2014even if they agreed to abide by the courts in the event of an adverse ruling, this wouldn\u2019t offer much comfort. But the larger dynamic is that Trump isn\u2019t merely pushing to redefine the boundaries of the law or even the Constitution. He is rejecting the principle that the law constrains him at all. The existence of a constitutional crisis cannot be understood solely in terms of the discrete claims of the executive branch vis-\u00e0-vis the other two. A president who maintains that the law means whatever he wants it to mean is a constitutional crisis. More Stories Elon Musk Thinks Democrats Should Love DOGE The Real Goal of the Trump Economy",

So why do Republicans hate it enough to lambast it, but love it enough to keep it around?Brittany is joined by NPR's education correspondent Cory Turner and author Josephine Riesman to talk about Trump's pick for education secretary, former WWE CEO Linda McMahon. And how Trump and McMahon are using the WWE playbook to reshape the American public education system.For more on this topic check out Cory's latest piece for NPR, Republicans' love/hate relationship with the Education Department, and Josie's investigation into the WWE, Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America.Support public media and receive ad-free listening & bonus content.

        "title": "AOC talks to NPR about Trump\u2019s political tipping point : NPR",
        "text": "Steve Inskeep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is trying to find her party's path back into power. The New York Democrat is a more seasoned figure than when she burst onto the national scene during the first Trump administration. Elected by surprise in 2018, Ocasio-Cortez was a progressive insurgent, a democratic socialist, a frequent critic of her own party, and a social media sensation. She was also a leading character on Fox News, a figure conservatives loved to hate. Seven years later, she remains an outsized public figure, who also has built relationships inside Congress with Democrats and even some Republicans. At 35, she is a veteran lawmaker. We sat with Ocasio-Cortez this week just after House Democrats managed a show of unity: they all voted against a Republican budget plan, which barely passed. We talked through her party's path toward political recovery. Here are a few key points from our video interview. She thinks Republicans' early moves will hurt them. \"The Republican Party is making certain large errors right now,\" she said, predicting that an $880 billion cut to Medicaid would affect many voters' health care, and that the president's bid to fire many federal workers will degrade critical services. She's still defending people without legal status. Since their election defeat, some Democrats have suggested their party needs a fresh approach to immigration. Many voters saw President Biden's administration as too lax toward people in the U.S. without legal status. Ocasio-Cortez insists that she still favors a path to citizenship. And she publicly feuded with Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, after she held an online know-your-rights seminar for people who feared being confronted by immigration agents. When threatened with investigation, she challenged the Justice Department to try it. Homan told Fox News that he had asked the Justice Department if she was violating the law by trying \"to educate people how they evade law enforcement.\" \"I was informing all of my constituents of their constitutional protections and in particular, their constitutional protections against illegal search and seizure,\" Ocasio-Cortez told NPR. She said she intended to put a question to the Justice Department herself: \"Well, there is a member of the Trump administration who is threatening and seeks to open an inquiry. And are you going to do it?\" After the interview, the Democrat sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which she shared with NPR. \"I write to request clarity on whether the Department of Justice has yielded to political pressure and attempts to weaponize the agency against elected officials whose speech they disagree with.\" Like Trump, she says government doesn't work for many people. \"Everything feels increasingly like a scam,\" she said. \"Not only are grocery prices going up, but it's like everything has a fee and a surcharge. And I think that anger is put out at government.\" The Democrat asserts that in her view, government is working very well for the wealthy, while often failing ordinary people. Unlike Trump, she doesn't want to drastically cut government. \"I mean to the FAA? No. To the NIH? No,\" she said. \"I actually don't want someone taking a wrecking ball to someone's chemotherapy to just see what happens.\" She said she was open to examining \"certain things like Medicare Advantage that I think is a scam, \" allowing private insurers to collect extra premiums.

        "text": "By Erika Beras , Wailin Wong A pause on the release of $2 billion in foreign aid could affect the government's longest-running permanent program for international food assistance \u2014 Food for Peace. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Last night, Chief Justice John Roberts paused a lower court ruling that said the Trump administration must release about $2 billion in foreign aid while the court reviews the case. This pause and the final decision could affect Food for Peace. That's the government's longest-running permanent program for international food assistance. It dates all the way back to the post-World War II period when American farmers found themselves with a surplus of grain. President Eisenhower signed it into law in 1954.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DWIGHT D EISENHOWER: In the interest of reinforcing peace and well-being of free people throughout the world - in short, using food for peace.CHANG: Food for Peace is now part of USAID, and with USAID's future tied up in litigation, the program's future is in question. And so, too, is the outlook for American farmers who benefit from the program. Our colleagues, Wailin Wong and Erika Beras from The Indicator, report.WAILIN WONG, BYLINE: In 2020, the federal government bought around $2 billion worth of food aid from American farmers. These commodities were then distributed internationally.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: That $2 billion represents less than a percent of the income farmers make from their crops. Still, for some industries, the government purchases are crucial.WONG: Michelle Erickson-Jones is a fourth-generation farmer in Montana. Michelle says USAID food assistance programs are vital to her state.MICHELLE ERICKSON-JONES: Well, it's not like we're just giving this aid for the sake of giving dollars. We're also building those relationships.WONG: Michelle cites Japan and South Korea as examples of this policy working well.BERAS: These countries were some of the earliest recipients of food aid. Then, as their economies grew, they went from being recipients of donated food to being paying customers.ERICKSON-JONES: So the root of the program allows Montana to successfully export as much wheat as we do.WONG: This deliberate effort to cultivate new markets was like a large-scale international trade version of when you get a free sample of something at the grocery store and then decide to buy it.BERAS: The national security rationale for food aid is that people who get this American-sponsored assistance are less likely to develop anti-U.S. sentiment. And Michelle says to also think of food aid as a border strategy. If people don't have to worry about going hungry, they're less likely to leave their home country and migrate to the U.S.ERICKSON-JONES: You know, there's this saying, like, you have 99 problems until, like, your one problem is food, and then you have one.WONG: Michelle says it can be hard to make the case to farmers to support programs like USAID. One reason for this is the supply chain that connects growers with the ultimate recipients of food assistance.BERAS: Typically, farms don't sell their crops directly to USAID. Instead, they sell to a company like Cargill or Bunge. So farmers might not even know that they're participating in a program like Food for Peace.WONG: Michelle says loss of that revenue from the closure of USAID might not be immediately felt.BERAS: But lawmakers in agriculture-heavy states are moving with urgency. Kansas Senator Jerry Moran, along with several other lawmakers, has proposed a bill to move Food for Peace from USAID to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JERRY MORAN: USDA has boots on the ground and the infrastructure already in place to support the logistics for food assistance.WONG: Moran says under the current system, foreign aid was being mismanaged. He pointed to an example of a Syrian national who was accused of selling USAID food kits on the black market to leaders of a terror organization. Jordan Schermerhorn is one of the many contract workers with USAID who was furloughed.BERAS: She's skeptical whether USDA has the right expertise in staffing in each country to distribute food aid. Still, she believes some USAID programs will survive.JORDAN SCHERMERHORN: Every senator wants to protect USAID's investments in their state. It turns out USAID funds a bunch of different things in a bunch of different states.WONG: We contacted the State Department, which is now running USAID. We asked about the department's long-range plans for the agency. We also asked what role Secretary of State Marco Rubio believes American agriculture should play in food security and U.S. foreign policy.BERAS: A spokesperson told us via email that the State Department is reviewing foreign aid and that, quote, \"programs that serve our nation's interests will continue. However, programs that aren't aligned with our national interest will not,\" end quote.

Jordan Schermerhorn is one of the many contract workers with USAID who was furloughed.BERAS: She's skeptical whether USDA has the right expertise in staffing in each country to distribute food aid. Still, she believes some USAID programs will survive.JORDAN SCHERMERHORN: Every senator wants to protect USAID's investments in their state. It turns out USAID funds a bunch of different things in a bunch of different states.WONG: We contacted the State Department, which is now running USAID. We asked about the department's long-range plans for the agency.

And so, too, is the outlook for American farmers who benefit from the program. Our colleagues, Wailin Wong and Erika Beras from The Indicator, report.WAILIN WONG, BYLINE: In 2020, the federal government bought around $2 billion worth of food aid from American farmers. These commodities were then distributed internationally.ERIKA BERAS, BYLINE: That $2 billion represents less than a percent of the income farmers make from their crops. Still, for some industries, the government purchases are crucial.WONG: Michelle Erickson-Jones is a fourth-generation farmer in Montana. Michelle says USAID food assistance programs are vital to her state.MICHELLE ERICKSON-JONES: Well, it's not like we're just giving this aid for the sake of giving dollars. We're also building those relationships.WONG: Michelle cites Japan and South Korea as examples of this policy working well.BERAS: These countries were some of the earliest recipients of food aid. Then, as their economies grew, they went from being recipients of donated food to being paying customers.ERICKSON-JONES: So the root of the program allows Montana to successfully export as much wheat as we do.WONG: This deliberate effort to cultivate new markets was like a large-scale international trade version of when you get a free sample of something at the grocery store and then decide to buy it.BERAS: The national security rationale for food aid is that people who get this American-sponsored assistance are less likely to develop anti-U.S. sentiment. And Michelle says to also think of food aid as a border strategy. If people don't have to worry about going hungry, they're less likely to leave their home country and migrate to the U.S.ERICKSON-JONES: You know, there's this saying, like, you have 99 problems until, like, your one problem is food, and then you have one.WONG: Michelle says it can be hard to make the case to farmers to support programs like USAID. One reason for this is the supply chain that connects growers with the ultimate recipients of food assistance.BERAS: Typically, farms don't sell their crops directly to USAID. Instead, they sell to a company like Cargill or Bunge. So farmers might not even know that they're participating in a program like Food for Peace.WONG: Michelle says loss of that revenue from the closure of USAID might not be immediately felt.BERAS: But lawmakers in agriculture-heavy states are moving with urgency.

Jordan Schermerhorn is one of the many contract workers with USAID who was furloughed.BERAS: She's skeptical whether USDA has the right expertise in staffing in each country to distribute food aid. Still, she believes some USAID programs will survive.JORDAN SCHERMERHORN: Every senator wants to protect USAID's investments in their state. It turns out USAID funds a bunch of different things in a bunch of different states.WONG: We contacted the State Department, which is now running USAID.

If people don't have to worry about going hungry, they're less likely to leave their home country and migrate to the U.S.ERICKSON-JONES: You know, there's this saying, like, you have 99 problems until, like, your one problem is food, and then you have one.WONG: Michelle says it can be hard to make the case to farmers to support programs like USAID. One reason for this is the supply chain that connects growers with the ultimate recipients of food assistance.BERAS: Typically, farms don't sell their crops directly to USAID. Instead, they sell to a company like Cargill or Bunge. So farmers might not even know that they're participating in a program like Food for Peace.WONG: Michelle says loss of that revenue from the closure of USAID might not be immediately felt.BERAS: But lawmakers in agriculture-heavy states are moving with urgency. Kansas Senator Jerry Moran, along with several other lawmakers, has proposed a bill to move Food for Peace from USAID to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JERRY MORAN: USDA has boots on the ground and the infrastructure already in place to support the logistics for food assistance.WONG: Moran says under the current system, foreign aid was being mismanaged. He pointed to an example of a Syrian national who was accused of selling USAID food kits on the black market to leaders of a terror organization. Jordan Schermerhorn is one of the many contract workers with USAID who was furloughed.BERAS: She's skeptical whether USDA has the right expertise in staffing in each country to distribute food aid. Still, she believes some USAID programs will survive.JORDAN SCHERMERHORN: Every senator wants to protect USAID's investments in their state. It turns out USAID funds a bunch of different things in a bunch of different states.WONG: We contacted the State Department, which is now running USAID. We asked about the department's long-range plans for the agency. We also asked what role Secretary of State Marco Rubio believes American agriculture should play in food security and U.S. foreign policy.BERAS: A spokesperson told us via email that the State Department is reviewing foreign aid and that, quote, \"programs that serve our nation's interests will continue.

        "title": "Former DOGE staffer explains her decision to quit : NPR",
        "text": "By Courtney Dorning , Mia Venkat , Ari Shapiro Staffers of the Department of Government Efficiency resigned in protest saying they won't use their skills to dismantle government services. One woman shares the reasons why she took this step. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  There was a time when federal government work was shorthand for a safe and predictable job - not anymore. Today, federal government employees face drama, uncertainty and conflict, coming largely from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. President Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk are trying to shrink the size and scope of the federal workforce. The department carrying out this mission is a decade old and had hundreds of employees, previously known as U.S. Digital Service. On Tuesday, 21 of those employees resigned in protest. In an anonymous letter, they said, quote, \"we will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data or dismantle critical public services.\"Well, our next guest is one of those people, and because she's worried about retaliation for speaking out, we've agreed to use only her first and middle initials - DK. She told me everything changed the day after the inauguration.DK: On January 21, we were all required to attend 15-minute interviews with people who only identified themselves as DOGE and their first names. At that point, it was unclear if these were government employees or not. And after those interviews, we got the response of, no comment, on whether our projects should change. And so it was a time of extreme uncertainty, but we tried to stay focused on the projects and - I know for me - try and just continue the work for as long as I could.SHAPIRO: So this resignation letter says people who arrived with DOGE fired technical experts, mishandled sensitive data and broke critical systems. Can you give us an example of an instance you saw that happen?DK: Yeah. There are quite a few. One of the big ones, and there has been information that has come out that is incorrect, is in regards to the Social Security Administration - the access to that data. That data contains all the information on any person who has ever been eligible for Social Security. It doesn't mean that it's somebody who is actively receiving Social Security, and perhaps it could be somebody who passed away quite a long time ago. That data, not only is it being utilized incorrectly, but the access to it and the feeding it into other systems makes all of that data and all of the American people's data very insecure.SHAPIRO: How would you respond to people who say, well, these are disaffected Democrats who are heading for the exits?DK: I would say that is a gross mischaracterization of the United States Digital Service as a whole. While we were founded during the Obama administration, United States Digital Service still operated during the first Trump administration and were - was able to do good work during that time. We cover the gambit as far as our political leanings. And part of being an EOP employee and the oath that we swear to the Constitution when we start is to operate in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. We are here to serve the American people. It is not a political issue.SHAPIRO: You could have chosen to stay and try to work within the system. What was the tipping point that made you decide leaving was the best choice?DK: The first real tipping point came when many of my colleagues were fired for seemingly no reason, when they had been performing exceptionally at their jobs and were dedicated to serving this country and to help improve this country's governmental systems. The second tipping point came when it became clear that the former United States Digital Service would be asked to become more involved with DOGE's activities. And those activities are the antithesis of what United States Digital Service was founded upon and what the mission has been - to do the most good for the most amount of people, to go where the work is and to hire and empower great people, which means supporting our agency partners and uplifting the federal servants. I realized that my actions would - if I stayed, would just further legitimize DOGE and potentially cross extreme ethical and legal lines.SHAPIRO: Cross ethical and legal lines how?DK: Some of the activities that DOGE has currently been focused on are gaining access to government systems that house the American people's data. And with that, it is unclear whether they are upholding privacy and security standards that are regularly practiced throughout the government before the new administration came in. There's a high risk of the American people's data being exposed or being utilized for nefarious means. And it also creates the opportunity for potential foreign actors to come in and get access to that data as well. That is completely across the line both legally and ethically, and something I realized I could no longer do good from the inside and that I must leave.SHAPIRO: DK was, until earlier this week, an employee at the Department of Government Efficiency. She, along with 20 of her colleagues, left DOGE in protest. Thank you for speaking with us.DK: Thank you.SHAPIRO: And on the platform X, Elon Musk suggested the staffers would have been fired had they not resigned. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the mass resignation in a statement saying, quote, \"don't let the door kick you on the way out.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.

While we were founded during the Obama administration, United States Digital Service still operated during the first Trump administration and were - was able to do good work during that time. We cover the gambit as far as our political leanings. And part of being an EOP employee and the oath that we swear to the Constitution when we start is to operate in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. We are here to serve the American people. It is not a political issue.SHAPIRO: You could have chosen to stay and try to work within the system. What was the tipping point that made you decide leaving was the best choice?DK: The first real tipping point came when many of my colleagues were fired for seemingly no reason, when they had been performing exceptionally at their jobs and were dedicated to serving this country and to help improve this country's governmental systems. The second tipping point came when it became clear that the former United States Digital Service would be asked to become more involved with DOGE's activities. And those activities are the antithesis of what United States Digital Service was founded upon and what the mission has been - to do the most good for the most amount of people, to go where the work is and to hire and empower great people, which means supporting our agency partners and uplifting the federal servants. I realized that my actions would - if I stayed, would just further legitimize DOGE and potentially cross extreme ethical and legal lines.SHAPIRO: Cross ethical and legal lines how?DK: Some of the activities that DOGE has currently been focused on are gaining access to government systems that house the American people's data. And with that, it is unclear whether they are upholding privacy and security standards that are regularly practiced throughout the government before the new administration came in. There's a high risk of the American people's data being exposed or being utilized for nefarious means. And it also creates the opportunity for potential foreign actors to come in and get access to that data as well. That is completely across the line both legally and ethically, and something I realized I could no longer do good from the inside and that I must leave.SHAPIRO: DK was, until earlier this week, an employee at the Department of Government Efficiency. She, along with 20 of her colleagues, left DOGE in protest. Thank you for speaking with us.DK: Thank you.SHAPIRO: And on the platform X, Elon Musk suggested the staffers would have been fired had they not resigned. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the mass resignation in a statement saying, quote, \"don't let the door kick you on the way out.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.

There was a time when federal government work was shorthand for a safe and predictable job - not anymore. Today, federal government employees face drama, uncertainty and conflict, coming largely from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. President Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk are trying to shrink the size and scope of the federal workforce. The department carrying out this mission is a decade old and had hundreds of employees, previously known as U.S. Digital Service. On Tuesday, 21 of those employees resigned in protest. In an anonymous letter, they said, quote, \"we will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data or dismantle critical public services.\"Well, our next guest is one of those people, and because she's worried about retaliation for speaking out, we've agreed to use only her first and middle initials - DK. She told me everything changed the day after the inauguration.DK: On January 21, we were all required to attend 15-minute interviews with people who only identified themselves as DOGE and their first names. At that point, it was unclear if these were government employees or not. And after those interviews, we got the response of, no comment, on whether our projects should change. And so it was a time of extreme uncertainty, but we tried to stay focused on the projects and - I know for me - try and just continue the work for as long as I could.SHAPIRO: So this resignation letter says people who arrived with DOGE fired technical experts, mishandled sensitive data and broke critical systems. Can you give us an example of an instance you saw that happen?DK: Yeah. There are quite a few. One of the big ones, and there has been information that has come out that is incorrect, is in regards to the Social Security Administration - the access to that data. That data contains all the information on any person who has ever been eligible for Social Security. It doesn't mean that it's somebody who is actively receiving Social Security, and perhaps it could be somebody who passed away quite a long time ago.

Thank you for speaking with us.DK: Thank you.SHAPIRO: And on the platform X, Elon Musk suggested the staffers would have been fired had they not resigned.

SHAPIRO: So this resignation letter says people who arrived with DOGE fired technical experts, mishandled sensitive data and broke critical systems. Can you give us an example of an instance you saw that happen?DK: Yeah. There are quite a few. One of the big ones, and there has been information that has come out that is incorrect, is in regards to the Social Security Administration - the access to that data. That data contains all the information on any person who has ever been eligible for Social Security. It doesn't mean that it's somebody who is actively receiving Social Security, and perhaps it could be somebody who passed away quite a long time ago. That data, not only is it being utilized incorrectly, but the access to it and the feeding it into other systems makes all of that data and all of the American people's data very insecure.SHAPIRO: How would you respond to people who say, well, these are disaffected Democrats who are heading for the exits?DK: I would say that is a gross mischaracterization of the United States Digital Service as a whole. While we were founded during the Obama administration, United States Digital Service still operated during the first Trump administration and were - was able to do good work during that time. We cover the gambit as far as our political leanings. And part of being an EOP employee and the oath that we swear to the Constitution when we start is to operate in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. We are here to serve the American people. It is not a political issue.SHAPIRO: You could have chosen to stay and try to work within the system. What was the tipping point that made you decide leaving was the best choice?DK: The first real tipping point came when many of my colleagues were fired for seemingly no reason, when they had been performing exceptionally at their jobs and were dedicated to serving this country and to help improve this country's governmental systems. The second tipping point came when it became clear that the former United States Digital Service would be asked to become more involved with DOGE's activities. And those activities are the antithesis of what United States Digital Service was founded upon and what the mission has been - to do the most good for the most amount of people, to go where the work is and to hire and empower great people, which means supporting our agency partners and uplifting the federal servants. I realized that my actions would - if I stayed, would just further legitimize DOGE and potentially cross extreme ethical and legal lines.SHAPIRO: Cross ethical and legal lines how?DK: Some of the activities that DOGE has currently been focused on are gaining access to government systems that house the American people's data. And with that, it is unclear whether they are upholding privacy and security standards that are regularly practiced throughout the government before the new administration came in. There's a high risk of the American people's data being exposed or being utilized for nefarious means. And it also creates the opportunity for potential foreign actors to come in and get access to that data as well. That is completely across the line both legally and ethically, and something I realized I could no longer do good from the inside and that I must leave.SHAPIRO: DK was, until earlier this week, an employee at the Department of Government Efficiency.

        "title": "21 DOGE staffers resigned in protest. She was one of them : Consider This from NPR : NPR",
        "text": "Leader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's second term.\n                \n                    \n                    JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Leader of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk wears a shirt that says \"Tech Support\" as he speaks during the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's second term. On Tuesday, 21 employees working under DOGE resigned in protest. In an anonymous letter, they wrote, \"We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.\" D.K. is one of those people \u2013 because she's worried about retaliation for speaking out, NPR has agreed to use only her first and middle initials. She used to work for U.S. Digital Service, which was launched in 2014 to improve how the federal government delivered information online to Americans. On his first day in office this term, President Trump signed an executive order changing the name to the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. D.K. once worked in the private sector, but wanted to dedicate her skills to helping people. \"When I found United States Digital Service, it seemed like the perfect fit,\" she told All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro. \"The ability to go out and use my knowledge and expertise to help make the government systems better was the biggest draw.\" The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Ari Shapiro: So this resignation letter says people who arrived with DOGE fired technical experts, mishandled sensitive data and broke critical systems. Can you give us an example of an instance where you saw that happen? D.K.: Yeah, there are quite a few. One of the big ones and there has been information that has come out that is incorrect is in regards to the Social Security Administration. The access to that data \u2013 that data contains all the information on any person who has ever been eligible for Social Security. It doesn't mean that it's somebody who is actively receiving Social Security, and perhaps it could be somebody who passed away quite a long time ago. That data, not only is it being utilized incorrectly, but the access to it and the feeding it into other systems makes all of that data and all of the American people's data very insecure. Shapiro: How would you respond to people who say, well, these are disaffected Democrats who are heading for the exits? D.K.: I would say that is a gross mischaracterization of the United States Digital Service as a whole. While we were founded during the Obama administration, United States Digital Service still operated during the first Trump administration and was able to do good work during that time. United States Digital Service members come from all different backgrounds and a lot of them from the private tech sector, and there are a lot of differing political opinions. We cover the gamut as far as our political leanings and part of being an EOP [Executive Office of the President] employee. And the oath that we swear to the Constitution when we start is to operate in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. We are here to serve the American people. It is not a political issue. Shapiro: You could have chosen to stay and try to work within the system. What was the tipping point that made you decide leaving was the best choice? D.K.: The first real tipping point came when many of my colleagues were fired for seemingly no reason, when they had been performing exceptionally at their jobs and were dedicated to serving this country and to help improve this country's governmental systems. The second tipping point came when it became clear that the former United States Digital Service would be asked to become more involved with DOGE's activities. And those activities are the antithesis of what United States Digital Service was founded upon and what the mission has been: to do the most good for the most amount of people, to go where the work is and to hire and empower great people, which means supporting our agency partners and uplifting the federal servants. I realized that my actions would, if I stayed, would just further legitimize DOGE and potentially cross extreme ethical and legal lines. Shapiro: Cross ethical and legal lines, how? D.K.: Some of the activities that DOGE has currently been focused on are gaining access to government systems that house the American people's data. And with that, it is unclear whether they are upholding privacy and security standards that are regularly practiced throughout the government before the new administration came in. There is a high risk of the American people's data being exposed or being utilized for nefarious means. And it also creates the opportunity for potential foreign actors to come in and get access to that data, as well. That is completely across the line, both legally and ethically, and something I realized I could no longer do good from the inside and that I must leave.

        "title": "Nazi-adjacent DOGE kids are overruling the secretary of state? Am I hearing this right?",
        "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. There is an alarming set of paragraphs here, in a new report in the Washington Post by longtime D.C. reporter Matt Bai! Let me set it up for you: \u201cRubio\u201d is congressionally confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who occupies a position that is traditionally considered one of the most powerful in the world. \u201cFarritor\u201d and \u201cKliger\u201d are Luke Farritor and Gavin Kliger, computer programmers in their mid-20s who work for DOGE, a so-called temporary organization created by executive order. \u201cMusk\u201d is Elon Musk. Rubio\u00a0had decreed\u00a0that certain critical programs\u2014such as aid to Ukraine and Syria and costs related to the PEPFAR program to combat HIV in Africa\u2014would continue to be funded. Several times, USAID managers prepared packages of these payments and got the agency\u2019s interim leaders to sign off on them with support from the White House. But each time, using their new gatekeeping powers and clearly acting on orders from Musk or one of his lieutenants, Farritor and Kliger would veto the payments\u2014a process that required them to manually check boxes in the payment system one at a time, the same tedious way you probably pay your bills online. Meanwhile, AIDS clinics shuttered and staff found themselves stranded in unstable countries\u00a0such as Congo. According to the administration, the Department of Government Efficiency is merely an advisory group that Musk oversees but does not formally direct. But according to Bai, Musk\u2014via his staff\u2014canceled payments that had been approved by both the secretary of state and the \u201cWhite House.\u201d Did President Donald Trump communicate with Musk about this? It seems unlikely. A week ago, in the Oval Office, Trump told a group of reporters that he was \u201cjust hearing\u201d\u2014like, from the reporters\u2014about work that DOGE was doing with the Department of Defense and Federal Aviation Administration. If Trump didn\u2019t know that DOGE staff was even in contact with the Department of Defense, it seems like the odds are not good that he\u2019s assiduously keeping tabs on which individual U.S. Agency for International Development payments DOGE is disbursing. And that would suggest that, in this case, Musk and his young deputies acted on their own initiative to shut down AIDS clinics in defiance of the president\u2019s staff and the secretary of state. Here\u2019s some other information about Kliger and Farritor that Bai doesn\u2019t mention: \u2022 A Twitter/X account that appears to belong to Kliger recently\u00a0retweeted\u00a0a post by\u00a0Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist streamer, belittling another user for posting a photo of his adopted Black child. The same Kliger account also follows a user named CremieuxRecueil, whose proprietor writes about the purported links between race and IQ\u00a0and has contributed to a newsletter affiliated with a race-science group whose reported leaders include a German political operative who wants to establish a whites-only ethnostate. \u2022 In a now-deleted Substack post, Kliger wrote that he owed his \u201cpolitical awakening\u201d to a 2013 article by Ron Unz, a U.S. far-right figure, that described the mainstream media as systematically dishonest. In other pieces, Unz has complained that the KKK is treated unfairly, asserted that \u201cJews have generally enjoyed a reputation for producing many of the world\u2019s greatest swindlers,\u201d and said that he believes the Holocaust likely did not take place. (In an email to Mother Jones, Kliger acknowledged writing the Substack post, but said he did not endorse Unz\u2019s other work and had not read specific controversial Unz pieces the magazine asked him to comment on.) \u2022 A Twitter account\u00a0that appears to belong to Farritor follows CremieuxRecueil as well as an account called\u00a0AnimeBibleVerse which has\u00a0posted pro-Nazi material (e.g., images that say \u201cAdolf Hitler was right about Jews\u201d and referred to Black individuals using the N-word). A different DOGE engineer appears to follow an account which has written that white people contribute more to society than other races and that Black people are better suited to playing basketball; a fourth appears to follow an account that was complaining, on Tuesday, that the National Security Agency employs \u201ctransgender Jews.\u201d There\u2019s much more down the DOGE\u2013white supremacist internet rabbit hole here, should you care to explore it. Is it crazy to say that final word on certain U.S. government activities might fall not to the president or secretary of state, but to near-teenagers who believe they are part of a sort of holy cause of restoring white men to their proper place of dominion over the world? Sure, it is crazy, isn\u2019t it? Slate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents \u00a9\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Will Trump and Republicans cut Medicaid? Reconciliation has House GOP representatives in a bind.",
        "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Republicans are coming off their best presidential election performance with low-income voters in recent memory. According to the (imperfect) 2024 exit polls, President Donald Trump won voters earning $50,000 or less, something he didn\u2019t do in either his 2016 or 2020 campaign. This is a landmark measure of the Trump-era realignment, with lower-income, noncollege voters of all races moving toward the Republican Party, while college-educated, higher-income white voters migrate to the Democrats. Republican governance, however, has not kept up with these changes. After a chaotic, grinding effort Tuesday to corral the necessary votes, House Republicans barely passed a blueprint for their \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d containing much of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. It tees up their ability to use the filibuster-proof reconciliation process to enact a sweeping bill, along party lines, down the road. The blueprint creates space for a mishmash of Republican priorities, like beefing up border security and boosting defense spending. But its core is the same old, same old: cutting spending for programs that poor people rely on, and cutting taxes. It is, in other words, roughly the same agenda that Republicans sought in 2017, when Trump entered the White House for the first time, even though the party\u2019s composition has changed significantly since then. (To clarify: This process is a separate negotiation from the other major ongoing legislative effort\u2014funding the government beyond March 14\u2014that will require Democratic cooperation. It has its own problems.) What House Republicans passed Tuesday is not the final bill achieving all of Trump\u2019s big, beautiful successes. Instead, this measure gives various committees their marching orders: The Armed Services Committee has put together a plan for $100 billion in new defense spending; the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, which have immigration and border jurisdiction, respectively, get $200 billion to play with; the Education and Workforce Committee has to find $330 billion in savings; and so on. Once the House and Senate pass an identical blueprint, then the committees set about writing the final bill itself, and try to pass that. All in all, the blueprint allows for $4.8 trillion in tax cuts and spending on other GOP priorities, while requiring at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts elsewhere. It also has a mechanism, at the conservative Freedom Caucus\u2019 request, that if Republicans don\u2019t reach $2 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over the next decade, then there\u2019s less money allowed for tax cuts. The most controversial element for Republicans is that the blueprint tasks the Energy and Commerce Committee with finding $880 billion in cuts. This powerful committee, once described as having jurisdiction over \u201canything that moves, burns, or is sold,\u201d also oversees Medicaid. Since Trump has ruled out cuts to Medicare, it\u2019s Medicaid, a program that spends nearly a trillion dollars a year, that\u2019s the obvious pot to raid for cash. Indeed, House Republicans earlier this year put out a menu of spending cuts they could choose from, and the bulk of the Energy and Commerce options relate to Medicaid. Republicans have some other big targets, for other committees, in mind, whether that\u2019s rolling back food stamps or student loans. But the members have cornered themselves into targeting Medicaid for the bulk of the savings they want to achieve in order to finance tax cuts. It has at least begun to dawn on some Republicans that the party now describing itself as the tribune of the American poor might be acting counterintuitively here. A group of eight GOP members of Congress representing significant Hispanic American populations\u2014a demographic sprinting to the Republican side of the aisle\u2014wrote a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson last week, warning that \u201cslashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open.\u201d Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who fancies himself a New Right populist, warned the House against \u201csevere cuts to Medicaid.\u201d So, too, has MAGA whisperer Steve Bannon. \u201cMedicaid, you gotta be careful,\u201d Bannon recently said on his podcast. \u201cBecause a lot of MAGAs are on Medicaid, I\u2019m telling you. If you don\u2019t think so, you are dead wrong.\u201d Trump himself seems to understand the damage Medicaid cuts could do to his coalition. But he\u2019s given mixed and conflicting views on the House GOP\u2019s targeting of Medicaid, as is his wont. Moderates\u2019 concerns about Medicaid were not Johnson\u2019s only worry as he tried to bring the plan to a vote at the beginning of the week. Certain conservatives with a flair for independence had their own gripes about the package\u2019s debt impact. It was a few of the conservative members holding out who stalled the action into Tuesday night. Those most concerned about Medicaid were placated earlier in the day to at least go along with this step. Two talking points were key to bringing them around. The first was the technically correct assertion that the blueprint does not mention the word Medicaid once. \u201cCan you specify one thing today that identifies a single cut?\u201d New York Rep. Mike Lawler told reporters Tuesday morning. The blueprint, as he said, is where \u201cyou start the process, and then you negotiate what the final terms of the agreement are going to be.\u201d This, again, is correct. But the blueprint does dig an $880 billion hole that is difficult, if not impossible, to fill without major cuts to Medicaid\u2014and not just \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d For now, though, Republicans can say with a straight face that they\u2019re simply beginning a process. Secondly, these members are also hoping that this will all be changed when the process moves to the Senate. \u201cUltimately, the question is: What is the Senate going to come back with?\u201d Lawler said. \u201cWe have to pass the same resolution, right?\u201d In other words, House Republicans expect that the version of the blueprint that comes out of the Senate\u2014which doesn\u2019t have to contend with a hard-ass Freedom Caucus\u2014won\u2019t put such a target on Medicaid. And so the process moves along. The bill that passed Tuesday night doesn\u2019t actually enact any cuts, and thus, it allows everyone to save face.\u00a0Eventually, though, this will all come to a head. The historically narrow House Republican majority, depending on any given day\u2019s attendance, can afford only one or two defections on a vote. On one end are moderates and vulnerable members, or members representing ascendant, working-class elements of the new Republican coalition, for whom cutting the social safety net makes no political sense whatsoever. On the other end are Freedom Caucus members, who believe with divine passion that the United States will soon collapse under the weight of its debt, and that meaningfully reducing that debt is their single biggest priority while they hold power. One side will eventually have to give. The GOP is training its sights on Medicaid for cuts only because Trump had ruled out changes to Medicare and Social Security, both commonly understood to be third rails. But it might be dated thinking for the GOP, given the changes in its coalitional composition, to not consider Medicaid a third rail of its own. The party will either back off or risk finding out the hard way. Slate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

        "text": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. In 2021, Steve Berger, an evangelical pastor who has attacked the separation of church and state as \u201ca delusional lie\u201d and called multinational institutions \u201cdemonic,\u201d set off on an ambitious project. His stated goal: minister to members of Congress so that what \u201cthey learn is then translated into policy.\u201d His base of operations would be a six-bedroom, $3.7 million townhouse blocks from the U.S. Capitol. Recently, the pastor scored a remarkable coup for a political influence project that has until now managed to avoid public scrutiny. He got a new roommate. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been staying at the home since around the beginning of this year, according to interviews and videos obtained by ProPublica. The house is owned by a major Republican donor and Tennessee car magnate who has joined Berger in advocating for and against multiple bills before Congress. Over the past four years, Berger and his wife, Sarah Berger, have dedicated themselves to what they call their D.C. \u201cministry center.\u201d In addition to Johnson, who is an evangelical conservative, the pastor has built close relationships with several other influential conservative politicians. Dan Bishop, now nominated for a powerful post in the Trump White House, seems to have also lived in the home last year while he was still a congressman, according to three people. A spokesperson for Johnson said that the speaker \u201cpays fair market value in monthly rent for the portion of the Washington, D.C. townhome that he occupies.\u201d He did not answer a question about how much Johnson is paying.

Was it helpful? The Bergers have described their mission as galvanizing political allies to take action. \u201cIt\u2019s just iron sharpening iron,\u201d Sarah Berger said on a podcast last summer, explaining the couple\u2019s approach to political influence. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m standing firm on this policy.\u2019\u201d Steve Berger claims to have personally spurred legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s a humbling thing,\u201d he said in a sermon in late 2022. \u201cYou get a text message from a senator that says: \u2018Thank you for your inspiration. Because it has caused me now to create a bill that is going to further righteousness in this country.\u2019\u201d Berger\u2019s interests extend beyond his staunch social conservatism. He and the donor who owns the house, Lee Beaman, have publicly advocated together for numerous specific policy changes, including a bill that would make it easier to fire federal employees and a regulation that would reduce fuel efficiency standards for the automotive industry. After the 2020 election, they both signed a letter declaring that President Donald Trump was the rightful winner and calling for Congress to overturn the results. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, did not respond to questions about how he ended up staying at the home. Beaman did not respond to requests for comment. The earliest date ProPublica was able to confirm Johnson being at the Berger house was in mid-December. A video reviewed by ProPublica shows Johnson visiting the home on Dec. 15 with two women who appear to be his wife and daughter. They lingered outside before entering, while Johnson pointed around the building and down to the basement entrance as if he was giving a tour. Two days later, Berger sent a note to his supporters on social media: \u201cI so wish I could tell you all the massive doors that broke open this week.\u201d Since the beginning of the year, videos and interviews show, Johnson has regularly left the house in the morning and returned in the evening. One day that Johnson was there recently, Berger was also at the home, opening the front door barefoot in pajama bottoms. (It appears Johnson may primarily be staying in the home\u2019s two-bedroom basement.) Washington pieds-\u00e0-terre can prove a significant expense for members of Congress as they split time between the capital and their home districts. Johnson is less wealthy than many other lawmakers. He worked at conservative nonprofits before he entered public service, and on his most recent financial disclosure form he did not declare a single asset. When Johnson was elevated to the speakership in 2023, news reports indicated that rather than renting an apartment, he might be sleeping in his office. (Lawmakers must report debts, income and many financial holdings on disclosure forms but aren\u2019t required to list living expenses like rent.) The Berger home is in an upscale D.C. neighborhood full of lobbyists and corporate attorneys. Though it\u2019s not clear what the home\u2019s basement would fetch on the open market, it\u2019s not unusual for two-bedrooms in the area to rent for as much as $7,000 a month. Discounts on rent are generally prohibited by House ethics rules as improper gifts, experts said. In sermons and on social media, Berger has mentioned some of the topics he\u2019s discussed with Johnson and other members of Congress. Last year, Berger, a passionate supporter of the Israeli right-wing, said he\u2019d had \u201ca great conversation\u201d with the speaker about Israel. Recently, Johnson has described his conversations with Trump to the pastor, according to Berger. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Berger said in a sermon that he\u2019d advised \u201csome congressmen\u201d to see the conflict through the lens of Ezekiel 38 and 39, parts of the Bible some see as prophesying a great war before the Second Coming. He did not specify what that meant from a policy perspective. An energetic 60-year-old with a white goatee and penchant for preaching in sneakers and jeans, Berger has strong views on a wide range of issues, including economic policy and public health. He is vehemently opposed to the World Health Organization, which Trump moved to withdraw the U.S. from last month, and recently predicted that COVID-19 vaccines will result in \u201cyoung people dropping dead all over the place.\u201d He attacked the World Economic Forum at length in a recent sermon, accusing it of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of COVID-19 \u201cto implement their satanic plot.\u201d Berger is also against same-sex marriage, saying \u201cit opens the door to all manner of sexual depravity and wickedness\u201d \u2014 though he has said he has \u201cfriends who are practicing homosexuals, people I care about.\u201d He opposes homosexuality and \u201cheterosexual sin\u201d in equal measures, he\u2019s said, referring to acts like watching pornography and sex between unmarried adults. Berger\u2019s operation is organized as a nonprofit called Ambassador Services International, which runs on a budget of around $1 million per year, according to tax filings. The home where it is registered in Washington \u2014 and where Johnson has been staying \u2014 was purchased in early 2021. Once the home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass and later housing the Smithsonian Museum of African Art, it was advertised at the time as a \u201cfour-level Second Empire-style townhouse of impeccable elegance and exceptional scale,\u201d offering \u201cbespoke tranquility in a coveted location.\u201d The buyer was Crockett Ventures LLC. Corporate filings show its sole owner is Beaman, the donor and businessman, who built a fortune on a chain of car dealerships started by his father. He has given millions to Republican political groups, including large donations to the Trump campaign and political committees for the Heritage Foundation and the House Freedom Caucus. He\u2019s also served as the treasurer of a congressional campaign. Beaman was once so fed up with the restrictions that came with owning a home on a \u201cgovernment-controlled lake\u201d that he bought a sprawling property with a 50-acre private lake of its own, according to a profile in an architecture book. He became a fixture of Nashville media in recent years because of sordid allegations made by his fourth wife during their divorce, including that he made her watch what he called \u201ctraining films\u201d of him having sex with a prostitute. Beaman\u2019s lawyers wrote at the time that his wife\u2019s filing contained \u201cimpertinent and scandalous matter only meant to harass Mr. Beaman.\u201d Beaman has attended a Tennessee church that Berger founded, but it\u2019s not clear what role, if any, he plays in the pastor\u2019s influence project in Washington. It\u2019s also unclear whether the pastor\u2019s nonprofit pays for the use of the Capitol Hill townhouse. Berger came to prominence in his home state as the longtime pastor of Grace Chapel, a large church outside Nashville whose members have included the current governor of the state. In 2021, Berger left the church and he and his wife launched their project in Washington. He soon began Bible study sessions with senators, representatives and congressional aides, according to the Bergers. Meanwhile, Sarah Berger spent her time \u201cin relationship with and pouring into the lives of congressional wives,\u201d tax filings say. \u201cIron Sharpening Iron\u201d Pastor Steve Berger and his wife spoke about their project to influence politicians in a podcast last year. Steve Berger quickly made connections at the highest levels of the Republican Party. \u201cListen, I have confessed things to Steve that I wouldn't normally confess to anyone else,\u201d Mark Meadows, a White House chief of staff in the first Trump administration who remains an important ally of the president, said at a 2023 event with Berger. \u201cWe have been praying together, having a Bible study each and every week. Not just me, but several members of Congress.\u201d Read More A group of congressmen gathered on stage together to speak at the pastor\u2019s 60th-birthday party in October, including Bishop, Rep. Barry Moore, Rep. Andy Ogles and Rep. Warren Davidson. All four are current or former members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus. (None of the four responded to requests for comment.) Evidence suggests that Bishop also recently lived at the Capitol Hill townhouse. Three neighbors told ProPublica that the FBI visited them this month asking about Bishop, seemingly as part of the background check for his White House job. \u201cThey said that address,\u201d said one neighbor, adding that the agent showed a photo of Bishop. \u201cThey said: \u2018He lived there up to a couple months ago. Do you know him?\u2019\u201d Trump has nominated Bishop to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, the powerful White House office that recently moved to freeze funding streams across the federal government. Berger celebrated the nomination on Instagram: \u201cI want to congratulate my dear friend and brother, Congressman Dan Bishop, for accepting this incredible opportunity.\u201d Jeff Frankl contributed research.

        "text": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. A few months ago, Sen. Ted Cruz announced that he had uncovered $2 billion of science grants funded by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that prioritized \u201cradical political perspectives\u201d or \u201cneo-Marxist theories.\u2019\u2019 His aides on a congressional committee assembled the list by searching the project descriptions for 699 key terms like \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201cdiversify,\u201d \u201csegregation\u201d and \u201cHispanic culture.\u201d When Cruz released the database of this allegedly \u201cwoke\u201d research earlier this month, we decided to run our own experiment. We asked one of the models powering ChatGPT, which can sift through large amounts of data, to evaluate all 3,500 grant descriptions in the database as if it were an investigative journalist looking for Marxist propaganda, \u201cwoke ideology,\u201d or diversity, equity and inclusion. The model tried to give us descriptions of how each project might fit those themes. We were particularly interested in the grants where it came up blank. We then read through the researchers\u2019 full summaries of those and many other grants, including each one described in this story, looking for references to some of the keywords on the list. We found that Cruz\u2019s dragnet had swept up numerous examples of scientific projects funded by the National Science Foundation that simply acknowledged social inequalities or were completely unrelated to the social or economic themes cited by his committee. Among them, for example, was a $470,000 grant to study the evolution of mint plants and how they spread across continents. As best we can tell, the project ran into trouble with Republicans on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation because of two specific words used in its application to the NSF: \u201cdiversify,\u201d referring to the biodiversity of plants, and \u201cfemale,\u201d where the application noted how the project would support a young female scientist on the research team. Other projects our AI assistant led us to included: It\u2019s \u201cvery frightening,\u201d said Charlotte Lindqvist, a biology professor at the University at Buffalo who is conducting the research on mint plants. Lindqvist spends hours a day grinding up plant samples and analyzing their DNA to identify genetic differences between species. Studying plant diversity, she said, could help secure more resilient food systems. \u201cWe are really trying very, very hard ... to move our world forward, understanding it better through our sort of foundational, sometimes groundbreaking research,\u201d she said, \u201cand then you get flagged and blacklisted because there is a word like \u2018female\u2019 in your project.\u201d During Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Was it helpful? Staff for the Republicans on the Senate committee assembled their report by examining all NSF grants awarded to projects that began between January 2021 and April 2024. Using their list of keywords, they flagged those earmarked for research that they said was \u201coften based on neo-Marxist theories that identified merit by physical or ethnic attributes, not one\u2019s talent, work ethic, or intellectual curiosity.\u201d Evaluating the merits of these awards would require a deep understanding of dozens of scientific fields, from gravitational waves to DNA methylation. But the report describes a crude approach; while staffers did attempt to account for the different ways their keywords can be used, they did not manually review all grants. The report also failed to acknowledge that the NSF has a legal mandate to make science more inclusive of women, racial minorities and disabled people. Cruz released the full database just as the Trump administration\u2019s NSF said it was examining research grants to make sure they complied with the president\u2019s executive orders terminating diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Cruz said he requested \u201csignificant scrutiny\u201d of the grants in his database. At the time, the NSF was using a similar list of keywords for its review. Neither Cruz\u2019s office nor a spokesperson for Republicans on the committee responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s not clear if approved projects that are still waiting for payments will get their money. A federal judge ruled last Friday that the administration can\u2019t cancel or freeze grants for supporting diversity, equity and inclusion programs. When asked how it would respond to the judge\u2019s preliminary injunction, an NSF spokesperson directed ProPublica to an agency webpage, which had not been updated with information about the court ruling at the time of publication. \u201cNSF is working expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders,\u201d a spokesperson told ProPublica in response to questions about its review process. The Senate committee\u2019s list includes words like \u201cdiversify\u201d and \u201cbiases,\u201d which have technical meanings unrelated to social issues. Although the report\u2019s authors worked to remove grants flagged for those reasons, some, like Lindqvist\u2019s, slipped through. The lack of precision in the committee\u2019s methodology is \u201cobviously laughable,\u201d said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of international affairs at Princeton University who studies the rise and fall of constitutional governments. But she also worries about what might happen if lawmakers take a more serious approach, such as trying to ban research on racial inequality, similar to how Congress severely limited studies on gun violence. The NSF evaluates grant proposals based on two factors. The first is intellectual merit. Every application is reviewed by a panel of experts \u2014 often other academics \u2014 who specialize in the same topic. They pore over detailed applications that include data, references and researchers\u2019 qualifications, far more information than the brief summaries evaluated by the Senate committee. The other factor is \u201cbroader impacts,\u201d which could include how the research might benefit societal well-being or make science more inclusive. Currently, federal laws require the NSF to support research at historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve groups who are underrepresented in science. Congress also ordered the NSF to fund efforts \u201cdesigned to increase the recruitment, retention, and advancement\u201d of members of these groups in scientific careers. \u201cAll of that is hard-wired into federal funding,\u201d Scheppele said. \u201cIf anyone was \u2018woke,\u2019 it was Congress.\u201d Laws passed by Congress have more legal weight than executive orders, so the NSF shouldn\u2019t prioritize Trump\u2019s order over its mandate to support underrepresented people in science, Scheppele said. The White House, she said in an email, is \u201cliterally asking the NSF to violate the law!\u201d The committee report singled out some projects for simply acknowledging that people from certain demographics face unique challenges. That includes a University of Houston study of maternal mortality that examines why Black, Indigenous and other people of color in the U.S. are nearly three times as likely as white women to die during pregnancy or within the first year after childbirth. Another project, which involved using drones to deliver defibrillators to people suffering cardiac arrest, appeared to be flagged because it noted that emergency response times are slower in low-income and minority neighborhoods. In other cases, the keywords that caught the committee\u2019s attention may have come from outreach efforts meant to broaden the impact of the research. A $6 million nuclear astrophysics project to study the origins of the universe includes a reference to attracting a \u201cdiverse group\u201d of students interested in the subject and a summer school program for increasing interest in nuclear-science careers, \u201cespecially among women and minorities.\u201d That\u2019s in line with a 1998 law that ordered the NSF to develop \u201cintellectual capital, both people and ideas, with particular emphasis on groups and regions that traditionally have not participated fully in science, mathematics, and engineering.\u201d Congress recognized \u201cyou\u2019re going to get better science\u201d that way, said Melissa Finucane, vice president of science and innovation at the Union of Concerned Scientists. When you get different perspectives interacting and thinking about complex problems, she said, you\u2019ll get different and new ways of solving a problem. The report\u2019s \u201csledgehammer\u201d methodology ignores the substantial scientific merit of these projects, many of which address \u201ccritical national needs in areas such as aerospace, agriculture, and computing infrastructure \u2014 as well as the need to broaden the talent pool,\u201d a spokesperson for Democrats on the Senate committee said in an email. The email said that ranking Democrat Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington \u201cunderstands that there is no way the United States can compete\u201d with the rest of the world on innovation \u201cwithout ensuring that NSF funding emphasizes the participation of women and minorities in STEM,\u201d a reference to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Rice University professor Vicky Yao has seen firsthand how efforts to broaden participation can increase excitement and interest in science. When Yao applied for a research grant in 2022, she included outreach to community college students, many of whom are from underrepresented populations and don\u2019t have access to research opportunities. When ProPublica informed Yao her $610,000 project was on the Senate committee\u2019s list, she found it bizarre that such technical work on DNA methylation \u2014 a process that can affect cancer and neurological diseases \u2014 could be labeled as \u201cwoke.\u201d The committee\u2019s choice of keywords is so sweeping that shutting down the research that uses those terms would end not just diversity programs but also vast fields of research on social science (\u201cBlack communities,\u201d \u201cracial inequality,\u201d \u201cLGBT\u201d), climate change (\u201cnet zero,\u201d \u201cclimate research,\u201d \u201cclean energy\u201d) and medicine (\u201cwhite women,\u201d \u201cvictims,\u201d \u201ctrauma\u201d). If any research related to women or minority populations is under fire, then \u201cwe\u2019re talking about maybe 65% of the American population. So at that point, what\u2019s left?\u201d said Dominic Boyer, an anthropology professor at Rice University whose project on reducing flood risk was flagged by the committee. \u201cUnder what authority, or according to what philosophy, can a government invalidate or discredit research that\u2019s focusing on two-thirds of the population?\u201d Read More Boyer received an award of $750,000 to use nature-based solutions like rain gardens to reduce flooding in Houston, where Hurricane Harvey displaced tens of thousands of people in 2017. His team has begun collaborating closely with residents from three neighborhoods: two lower-income communities where the residents are mostly Hispanic, Black or Asian, and a middle-income neighborhood with mostly Hispanic and white residents. He initially assumed that\u2019s why his research was flagged. But it turned out that the triggering keywords may have come from boilerplate language that describes the specific NSF program that funded Boyer\u2019s work: Strengthening American Infrastructure. The portions of the grant\u2019s program description containing those keywords were written by the NSF during Trump\u2019s first term. It used the words \u201csocioeconomic\u201d and \u201cequal opportunity\u201d to explain why infrastructure is important to society. The same description is found in more than two dozen other grants on the committee\u2019s list. Boyer said it speaks to a kind of \u201cOrwellian absurdity\u201d that \u201cthese words can only have one meaning, and it\u2019s the meaning that they would like to politicize.\u201d Sharon Lerner contributed reporting and Brandon Roberts contributed data reporting.

Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. The last time Missouri took control of St. Louis\u2019 police force was just before the start of the Civil War, when the state\u2019s secessionist-leaning leaders were trying to prevent police officers from taking up arms against the Confederacy. The law that put the police department under state control was in effect for the next 152 years. In November 2012, nearly two-thirds of voters approved a statewide ballot measure, pushed by police reform activists and elected officials, that restored local authority and placed the department under the mayor\u2019s jurisdiction. Now, the state\u2019s Republican governor and GOP-led legislature are again pushing to take over the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. They argue that the Democratic-run city government is responsible for a drop in officer morale and that statistics that show a decline in crime are inaccurate. The Missouri House voted 106-47 last week to transfer control from the city to a state-appointed board this summer. The five-member board would be made up of the mayor and four commissioners appointed by the governor, essentially leaving the governor with the votes to control the police department. The state Senate is debating the measure, but a vote has not yet been scheduled. The attempt to reverse a measure overwhelmingly approved by state voters, albeit more than a decade ago, is part of a broader pattern of Missouri\u2019s conservative-led government trying to override the will of the electorate, from repealing voter-approved redistricting reform to trying to reinstate an abortion ban even though voters approved a constitutional amendment last year legalizing the procedure. State takeovers of metropolitan police departments are rare; Kansas City, Missouri, remains the only major U.S. city with its police force under state control. Its arrangement dates to Reconstruction, when Missouri lawmakers, aiming to limit Black political influence, stripped the city of its oversight role.

Was it helpful? After a brief return to local control in the 1930s, the state reasserted authority over Kansas City police to weaken political boss Tom Pendergast, who had used the department for patronage and election fraud. Baltimore recently regained control of its police department after 160 years of state control. Republican-led states have taken away control of other aspects of government from local leaders in other cities with majority-Black populations. In Mississippi, officials have expanded the jurisdiction of the state-run Capitol Police beyond government buildings into residential and commercial areas in Jackson, the state capital. They\u2019ve also created a state-run court with appointed judges and increased police funding while the Black-led Jackson Police Department struggles to respond to calls. Texas and Missouri have intervened in local schools and city governments, leading to disputes about local control \u2014 though these takeovers have generally been temporary, with a path to restoring local authority. In Tennessee, the state comptroller backed down from taking over the majority-Black city of Mason after local officials agreed that a certified public accounting or law firm would help the town complete audits, balance its budget and train officials on proper use of tax revenue. It happens in states led by Democrats, too, but less frequently. \u201cIt really is removing this political power from residents, allowing them to have less authority, oversight and voice in how their system of public safety and policing operates,\u201d said Sandhya Kajeepeta, a senior researcher at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund\u2019s Thurgood Marshall Institute. Some St. Louis leaders see the current effort there as echoing 19th-century efforts to limit Black political power. They argue that a majority-white, conservative government is again moving to strip authority from local officials and diminish Black influence over policing. State Sen. Karla May, a Black Democrat from St. Louis who has testified against the push for state control, said it\u2019s no coincidence that the plan became an urgent matter for legislators, and is advancing, during the tenure of Mayor Tishaura Jones, who also is Black. May said the St. Louis Police Officers Association, the collective bargaining unit for city police officers, \u201cdoes not want to be controlled by an African American mayor.\u201d Representatives from the union did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Jones did not make her available for an interview. But the mayor said in an emailed statement that \u201cI don\u2019t think Republican legislators want to give a Black woman who is also a Democrat credit for dramatically reducing crime, increasing officer pay and building out successful public safety programs.\u201d She said advocates for state control have never explained how it would improve public safety. The push to take control of the St. Louis police is a top priority for Gov. Mike Kehoe, a newly elected Republican whose State of the State address framed the issue in economic terms. He said what mattered was whether businesses felt \u201csafe enough to invest in our cities.\u201d Kehoe, who is white, frequently invokes his upbringing in St. Louis to push for state control. The House sponsor of the measure, Rep. Brad Christ, a white Republican from the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis, argues that calling his proposal \u201cstate control\u201d is misleading because the governor\u2019s appointees would be required to have lived in the city for at least three years. He noted that the effort to return the police to the state predates Jones\u2019 term as mayor. A Black Democrat from St. Louis filed a similar bill that stalled in the House in 2019 during the tenure of Mayor Lyda Krewson, who is white. Christ said in a text that this was \u201cclear evidence that the wild assertion that this effort has been race motivated is completely false.\u201d The Ethical Society of Police, a group that represents Black police officers in St. Louis, also supports a state takeover. Its president, Donnell Walters, wrote an opinion piece in 2023 with then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, calling for state control and alleging mismanagement and low morale under city control. Walters did not return messages seeking comment. Heather Taylor, a retired sergeant who led ESOP from 2015 to 2020 \u2014 and who later worked in the Jones administration before resigning in 2023 after criticizing the mayor and the department on social media \u2014 said she worries the department will suffer under state control. But, she said, ESOP members believe that the city lacks urgency in providing basic support for officers and that the state might do a better job addressing those needs. Jones has repeatedly pointed to city crime data showing a decline since she hired Robert Tracy as police chief two years ago. Notably, the city\u2019s murder totals have plummeted. Read More But many argue that the city\u2019s statistics on other types of crimes don\u2019t reflect the sense of lawlessness in St. Louis. Ness Sandoval, a professor of sociology and demography at Saint Louis University who studies crime trends, said he believes the city underreports crime and lacks transparency. \u201cMost people who rely on the data believe there probably should be an asterisk,\u201d he said. Jones has stood behind the crime numbers, saying they are accurate. Still, the mayor and her police chief maintain that state control does not necessarily reduce crime. In 2012, while the police were still under state oversight, Forbes magazine ranked St. Louis as the second-most-dangerous city in the nation. Kansas City, which is still under state control, continues to struggle with violent crime. Efforts to restore local oversight have never gained much traction there. Despite past studies and proposals \u2014 including a 1968 report listing local control as the top recommendation after police killed six Black residents during riots, and a 2013 mayoral committee vote for local control that failed by a single vote \u2014 no serious push has materialized.

        "title": "How Cambridge Analytica Used Intimate Data to Exploit Gun Owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Private Lives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ProPublica",
        "text": "For years, some of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most iconic gun-makers turned over sensitive personal information on customers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without their knowledge or consent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to the gun industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main lobbying group. Political operatives then employed those details to rally firearms owners to elect pro-gun politicians running for Congress and the White House. The strategy remained a secret for more than two decades. In a series of stories in recent months, ProPublica revealed the inner workings of the National Shooting Sports Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s project, using a trove of gun industry documents and insider interviews. We also showed how the NSSF teamed up with the controversial political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to turbocharge its outreach to gun owners and others in the 2016 election. Additional internal Cambridge reports obtained by ProPublica now detail the full scope and depth of the persuasion campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sophistication and intrusiveness. The political consultancy analyzed thousands of details about the lives of people in the NSSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enormous database. Were they shopaholics? Did they gamble? Did women buy plus-size or petite underwear? The alchemy had three phases. Amassing the Data Some of the data, excerpted here, was basic information you might find on a census, like marital status or ethnic group. But the data also contained much more specific information about a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aesthetic preferences, purchasing habits and hobbies. Other data highlighted consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal opinions, histories and even vices. How Cambridge converted those tiny bits of data into massive political wins has never before been made public. Its methods raise disturbing questions about how our personal data can be used to manipulate us. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a natural desire to stay anonymous and keep your own information, and this is such a violation of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Calli Schroeder, privacy specialist at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The NSSF has said its \u00e2\u0080\u009cactivities are, and always have been, entirely legal and within the terms and conditions of any individual manufacturer, company, data broker, or other entity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Larry Keane, senior vice president of the NSSF since 2000, said the trade group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 voter outreach campaign involved only commercially available data. But Cambridge emails and a report on the NSSF campaign said the data included 20 years of information about gun buyers harvested from manufacturer warranty cards given to the NSSF. A contractor for the trade group also handed Cambridge a database of shoppers at Cabela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a popular sporting goods retailer. (The general counsel for Bass Pro, which bought Cabela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in 2017, said the company had been unable to find evidence of Cabela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csharing customer information that was not compliant with their privacy policies at or prior to the time of acquisition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d) Cambridge documents show the firm compared names and addresses in the NSSF and Cabela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data against the same names and addresses found in a vast array of consumer purchase and lifestyle information, supplied by data broker companies. Creating the Profiles Next, analysts used an algorithm to profile and score each person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavioral traits based on the data and a psychological assessment tool called OCEAN that measures a human being\u00e2\u0080\u0099s openness to new and different experiences, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. From those scores, Cambridge organized people into five groups it called risk-takers, carers, go-getters, individualists and supporters. Members of each group received Facebook ads tailored to their group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s psychological profiles. Below are political ads and descriptions of those personality groups pulled from Cambridge documents for the NSSF project. The ads include hypothetical messages along with the actual versions the firm sent for the NSSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election campaign, called GunVote. Cambridge Analytica Description Scoring high on the scale for neuroticism, risk-takers are \u00e2\u0080\u009ceasily frustrated, disorganized, often late and more prone to addiction than others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They are \u00e2\u0080\u009cattracted to risky situations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d known for \u00e2\u0080\u009coverreacting to various situations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d act \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout thinking\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are \u00e2\u0080\u009coften perceived to be outsiders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Keywords include \u00e2\u0080\u009csecurity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cenemies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Persuasion Tactics Messaging \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould be constructed by first introducing negative scenarios, before providing a reassuring and authoritative solution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sample Ad Among examples Cambridge gave of ads targeting risk-takers is one that depicts a masked person breaking into a home with the message, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would you do?

Each pop-up ad said it came from the NSSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GunVote page, but they were crafted by Cambridge. The ads sent to potential voters in key states from June 21, 2016, through July 1, 2016, promoted Republican Sens. Richard Burr, Pat Toomey, Roy Blunt, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte and Ron Johnson. Nearly 817,000 people saw the messages, according to Cambridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal metric reports. For the next three months, Cambridge included voters in Colorado, Florida and Nevada in the multistate blast of ads and videos on social media. Altogether, they garnered nearly 378 million views and drove 60,140,280 visitors to the NSSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. Cambridge also mapped out the locations of people in the five personality groups in the key states and gave NSSF contractors lists containing their names and addresses. The contractors examined the numbers and locations of each persona on a county-by-county basis. Then they mailed to the potential voters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 homes messages designed to persuade them to cast ballots for the gun industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferred candidates.

For the third year, ProPublica will invite up to 10 news editors from media companies across the country to participate in a yearlong investigative editing training program, led by the newsroom\u2019s award-winning staff. Applications are now open for the ProPublica Investigative Editor Training Program. Submissions are due March 24 at 9 a.m. Eastern time. As the nation\u2019s premier nonprofit investigative newsroom, ProPublica is dedicated to journalism that changes laws and lives and to advancing the careers of the people who produce it. The goal of this program is to address our industry\u2019s critical need to broaden the ranks of investigative editors. Building a pipeline of talent is a priority that serves us and our industry. \u201cA great investigative editor can be a force multiplier for change; they not only make stories better, but journalists better,\u201d said Deputy Managing Editor Alexandra Zayas, an architect of the editor training program. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s one of the most difficult jobs to break into. Many who have succeeded learned from other investigative editors, so we created this program to seed those opportunities. We\u2019ve been amazed at how well it\u2019s worked.\u201d This year\u2019s program will begin in June 2025 with a weeklong boot camp in New York that will include courses and panel discussions on how to conceive of and produce investigative projects that expose harm and have impact. The editors will also get training in how to manage reporters who are working with data, documents and sensitive sources, including whistleblowers, agency insiders and people who have suffered trauma. The program also includes virtual continuing education sessions and support from a ProPublica mentor. This program is funded by the generosity of the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation, which supports organizations in journalism, film and the arts whose work is dedicated to social justice and strengthening democracy. The ProPublica Investigative Editor Training Program is designed to help expand the ranks of editors with investigative experience in newsrooms across the country, to help better reflect the nation as a whole. The program kicks off with a five-day intensive editing boot camp in New York, which includes a series of courses and panel discussions led by ProPublica\u2019s senior editors, veteran reporters and other newsroom leaders. The boot camp will include hands-on editing exercises and opportunities for participants to workshop projects underway in their own newsrooms. Afterward, participants will gather virtually for seminars and career development discussions with their cohort and ProPublica journalists. Each of the participants will also be assigned a ProPublica senior editor as a mentor for advice on story and management challenges or on how to most effectively pursue their own professional aspirations. The five-day, all-expenses-paid boot camp will be held June 1 to June 5, 2025, in New York, with remote sessions via Google Meet throughout the year. We are planning for the 2025 boot camp to be held in person and will not have a virtual option. ProPublica will cover participants\u2019 expenses for meals, travel and lodging during the boot camp. Up to 10 journalists. The program is open to all. The aim is to help broaden our industry\u2019s investigative editing ranks to include journalists from a wide array of backgrounds. We encourage everyone to apply, including those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and rural news organizations, as well as women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities. Past participants have come from a wide range of news outlets across the country. The ideal participants will have: No. The application period opens Wednesday and closes March 24 at 9 a.m. Eastern time. You can apply via this link.

        "text": "Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. In late 2020, St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in Helena, Montana, fired its oncologist, Dr. Thomas C. Weiner, and took the extraordinary step of publicly accusing him of hurting patients. The hospital said the doctor overprescribed narcotics and gave chemotherapy to patients who didn\u2019t have cancer, among other allegations. Despite being notified by St. Peter\u2019s that it had revoked Weiner\u2019s privileges, the Montana Board of Medical Examiners renewed his license in 2021 and 2023. This week, the board renewed his license again for another two years. Questions about whether Weiner would be permitted to continue practicing medicine intensified after a December ProPublica investigation exposed a trail of patient harm and at least 10 suspicious deaths tied to his practice. That investigation, which relied on thousands of pages of court records and dozens of interviews, detailed how Weiner built a high-volume business that billed as much as possible to public and private insurance while many of his patients received unnecessary, dangerous or substandard care. While it\u2019s unclear what the medical board considered before renewing Weiner\u2019s license, the investigation published by ProPublica and Montana Free Press caught the attention of law enforcement. Criminal investigators with the Montana Department of Justice launched an official inquiry this month, according to three sources directly involved in the matter. Weiner has denied mistreating his patients. He did not respond to a request for comment about his license being renewed and the Montana Department of Justice investigation.

Was it helpful? After St. Peter\u2019s fired Weiner, he sued the hospital for wrongful termination and defamation. After a four-year legal battle, the Montana Supreme Court sided with the hospital in a ruling this month. The court wrote that the hospital\u2019s peer-review process leading to Weiner\u2019s dismissal was \u201creasonable and warranted due to the quantity and severity of Weiner\u2019s inappropriate patient care.\u201d After it fired Weiner, the hospital inspected the files of more than 2,000 patients to whom he had prescribed controlled substances. Court records show that medical reviewers hired by St. Peter\u2019s highlighted the case of Sharon Dibble, a 75-year-old patient who died shortly after Weiner doubled her morphine prescription. That increase in morphine \u201cled to respiratory arrest and the patient\u2019s demise,\u201d a medical expert hired by St. Peter\u2019s concluded. Dibble\u2019s son, Tom Stevison, called the medical board\u2019s decision to renew Weiner\u2019s license \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just too much evidence against him, pointing to wrongdoing, to recklessly relicense this guy,\u201d he said, referring to the hospital\u2019s allegations and ProPublica\u2019s reporting. \u201cI do believe he should be held accountable.\u201d Weiner previously denied the allegation that he overprescribed patients, including Dibble, and was critical of the medical review. In the months after Weiner was fired, thousands of friends and former patients formed Facebook groups in support of him. They raised funds to rent a billboard in Helena that read, \u201cWE STAND WITH DR. WEINER.\u201d On Tuesday, Dayna Schwartz, who led that effort, posted on Facebook, \u201cCongrats Doc on your license renewal!!\u201d A spokesperson for the state Board of Medical Examiners referred a request for comment about Weiner\u2019s license renewal to its umbrella agency, the Montana Department of Labor and Industry. An agency spokesperson did not respond to questions before publication. St. Peter\u2019s did not respond to requests for comment on the renewal of Weiner\u2019s license. Read More The medical board does not typically release information about current or past investigations unless it substantiates allegations of professional misconduct. If it does, a doctor\u2019s license can be suspended or revoked for many reasons, including billing fraud, unprofessional prescribing practices and failure to appropriately document patient care. The criminal inquiry, led by the Montana Attorney General\u2019s Office, comes just months after the federal government settled with St. Peter\u2019s for making false claims when it billed government health programs for Weiner\u2019s services. The hospital agreed to pay back $10.8 million. The hospital has previously said it provides quality care and \u201cthis situation is isolated to a single, former physician, and we remain confident in the exceptional care provided by St. Peter\u2019s medical staff.\u201d Federal prosecutors also sued Weiner, accusing him of an array of fraudulent practices, including billing federal insurance programs for unnecessary treatments or more expensive treatments than were delivered.

        "text": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has gained access to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development system containing confidential personal information about hundreds of thousands of alleged victims of housing discrimination, including victims of domestic violence. Access to the system, called the HUD Enforcement Management System, or HEMS, is typically strictly limited because it contains medical records, financial files, documents that may list Social Security numbers and other private information. DOGE sought access, and HUD granted it last week, according to information reviewed by ProPublica and two officials familiar with the matter. This is just the latest collection of sensitive personal information that DOGE has tried to access in recent weeks. It has also sought personal taxpayer data kept by the IRS and information on Social Security benefit recipients, and it attempted to enter the Treasury Department\u2019s payment systems. DOGE\u2019s stated mission is to modernize government technology and cut excessive or improper spending. The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that DOGE needs \u201cdirect access\u201d to such systems to eliminate \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d DOGE\u2019s data-gathering moves at some agencies have sparked forceful pushback, including lawsuits over alleged privacy violations and opposition from career officials who have resigned or retired following access requests. Judges have temporarily blocked DOGE from gaining access to records at the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management and the Treasury Department. And, faced with resistance, DOGE agreed to view only anonymized taxpayer data at the IRS. Few records in the HUD system are redacted or anonymized, and many contain deeply personal material about those who have alleged or been accused of housing discrimination. Domestic violence case files can list addresses to which survivors have relocated for their safety. Harassment cases can include detailed descriptions of sexual assaults. Disability cases can include detailed medical records. Lending discrimination files could feature credit reports and bank statements. The names of witnesses who offered information \u2014 in some cases anonymously \u2014 about landlords accused of discrimination are among the files as well.

Was it helpful? HUD enforces numerous civil rights laws, including the Fair Housing Act and aspects of the Violence Against Women Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Such statutes collectively prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, disability and other characteristics. HUD officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, voiced concern that DOGE\u2019s access to HEMS could violate the privacy rights of discrimination victims and potentially put them at risk if their information is mishandled or leaked. The episode is one of many roiling HUD, where the Trump administration is reportedly considering a 50% cut to the nearly 10,000-person workforce. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which combats housing discrimination, may see its roughly 500-person staff cut by as much as 76%, according to an unconfirmed projection circulating widely among HUD employees and viewed by ProPublica. Civil liberties advocates expressed alarm about DOGE\u2019s access to the HUD data, saying it may violate the Privacy Act. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why a system dedicated to civil rights complaints would have any impact whatsoever on a department looking for inefficiencies in governmental spending,\u201d said Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. Venzke suggested DOGE may use HEMS data as a basis for scaling back housing discrimination enforcement. \u201cThere is deep concern that DOGE is not there to identify government inefficiencies, but rather to shutter programs that the administration disagrees with,\u201d he said. John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which is suing DOGE and other federal agencies and officials over DOGE\u2019s access, contended that the department had gained access to HEMS and systems like it \u201cunder the false pretenses of identifying fraud and abuse, when what\u2019s really going on is DOGE is trying to gain control over these databases to direct the activities of federal agencies.\u201d Spokespeople for HUD, the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment (including a question to DOGE about what it plans to do with HEMS). After this article was published, Kasey Lovett, HUD\u2019s head of public affairs, emailed ProPublica and stated, \u201cto be clear, DOGE does not have access to HEMS.\u201d Lovett declined to provide on-the-record evidence for her assertion. Read More HUD\u2019s Fair Housing office receives tens of thousands of housing discrimination allegations or inquiries annually and investigates \u2014 or assigns to state or local agencies \u2014 around 8,000 of them each year. Those investigations can last months or years and lead to financial settlements, compliance monitoring and policy reforms by landlords, mortgage lenders, local zoning officials and homeowners associations. Access to HEMS is usually limited to Fair Housing staffers, HUD attorneys and auditors, and state and local investigators. However, DOGE requested entry, and HUD granted read-only access last week to Michael Mirski, who has a HUD email address and whom officials at the housing agency have identified in internal discussions as being affiliated with DOGE. Mirski did not respond to a request for comment.

Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. In 2021, the number of people in Illinois killed from acts of domestic violence was growing at an alarming pace, and state legislators acted with a sense of urgency. In a near-unanimous vote, they passed legislation designed to blunt the trend. The state would establish a network of panels to review killings related to domestic violence and identify whether existing strategies for preventing them fell short. But since then the state has made only meager progress in implementing the plans laid out in that law, and the number of domestic violence killings continues to increase. The bill called for building the network over six years, but nearly four years after Gov. JB Pritzker signed it, only seven of the state\u2019s 102 counties have helped establish fatality case review teams. The first reviews began only late last year, and key deadlines have been missed. An initial report of statewide policy recommendations based on reviews by the panels was expected to be delivered to lawmakers in April 2024. But that has yet to happen. The most glaring absence from the program is Cook County, which is home to Chicago and accounts for nearly 40% of the state\u2019s population. Discussions between organizers of the initiative and agencies that could take charge of a local review panel in the county have failed to yield a commitment. People familiar with the effort say a lack of funding and a gap in leadership have slowed the initiative\u2019s progress. The law does not provide money to staff the local review panels, hampering recruitment of people to serve. Moreover, a top state administrator in charge of developing the network abruptly left the project and was only recently replaced. Illinois Sen. Celina Villanueva, one of several sponsors of the bill creating the initiative, acknowledged the delays but expressed confidence in the overall direction. \u201cMy hope is that once everything is fully established, that it\u2019s a strong working mechanism to be able to address the larger issues of why we passed this bill to begin with,\u201d she said. Cristin Evans, spokesperson for the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, the state agency that oversees the review effort, said that \u201cthe amount of time it has taken for teams to conduct their first review is not unexpected given the structure and complexity of the initiative.\u201d The current teams are on track to complete a minimum of two cases in 2025, she added. Recent killings underscore the urgency of addressing breakdowns in the systems designed to protect people from domestic violence. In November, Chicago police found Lacramioara Beldie stabbed to death in an apparent murder-suicide at the hands of her estranged husband, Constantin. Court records that surfaced after Beldie\u2019s death detailed a disturbing timeline. Six weeks before he allegedly killed his wife, Constantin Beldie appeared inside a Cook County court to face accusations he\u2019d assaulted and held her inside a car against her will. Prosecutors did seek to detain Beldie ahead of his trial over the incident but failed to submit evidence of his alleged prior abuse. Judge Thomas E. Nowinski denied the state\u2019s petition, noting that state prosecutors had failed to establish Beldie\u2019s alleged history of violence toward his wife and concluded he was a \u201cmedium-low risk.\u201d The judge released him on electronic monitoring. In a letter to the chief judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, nearly 30 Chicago-area elected officials, including several city alderpersons, blasted the \u201cmultiple systemic failures\u201d that led to Beldie\u2019s killing and called for Nowinski to be removed from domestic violence court. He was later transferred to municipal court, where he will oversee traffic and misdemeanor cases. But the chief judge has defended Nowinski, emphasizing prosecutors\u2019 role in the hearing\u2019s outcome. With the goal of learning from past failures, the fatality review legislation calls for a two-tiered approach, with county-based review teams and oversight from a statewide committee. The county teams are supposed to review the circumstances surrounding certain killings to assess how systems designed to intervene and prevent domestic violence performed. Just a few counties have joined review teams since 2021: Kankakee, Lake and Will, with joint teams operating in Madison and Bond counties as well as Winnebago and Boone counties. Those teams represent five of the state\u2019s 25 judicial circuits. During Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Was it helpful? The statewide committee consists of representatives of law enforcement, academics and social service providers. Drawing on the local teams\u2019 reviews, it is supposed to submit a report every two years outlining specific recommendations for \u201clegislative, systemic, policy, and any other changes to reduce domestic violence and domestic violence related fatalities.\u201d In its first report, in 2024, the committee revealed it could not yet provide recommendations because none of the local teams had been formed. Fatality review committees first appeared around 1995, as advocates and lawmakers around the United States began searching for new ways to stem the tide of domestic violence. In the years since, all but five states have established processes for reviewing fatal cases of domestic or intimate partner violence, according to the National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative, an Arizona nonprofit that helps states develop review boards. Those who back these efforts say they\u2019re a tool that can improve outcomes for the vulnerable people domestic violence prevention policies are intended to protect. A 2013 University of Washington study of outcomes in states that had established fatality reviews found that recommendations made by the panels had successfully prioritized issues related to their work. But prioritization alone \u201cmay not translate into organizational and institutional changes,\u201d the study found. Other states have experienced similar difficulties to Illinois\u2019, not only in establishing a review process but maintaining it over time. In South Carolina, implementation of the 2016 law establishing a review process of those killings has been \u201cuneven,\u201d said Sara Barber, executive director of the South Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. The state\u2019s apparatus is overseen by a central committee, with local teams operated by county-based district attorneys. But similar to Illinois\u2019 law, the South Carolina law does not include new funding. With resources already stretched thin, that has led to spotty participation among local groups. Many of the local teams meet only infrequently, Barber said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that there hasn\u2019t been progress, but there\u2019s more that could be done,\u201d she said. Even with all the attention the issue has received, not all states compile tallies of domestic violence-related killings. Tracking those numbers is notoriously difficult. Federal law requires law enforcement agencies to report general crime statistics. But determining whether there was domestic violence leading up to a killing requires collecting and analyzing records from disparate sources, something advocates say not all city or state governments require. That said, estimates made by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from death certificates, police reports and other sources reveal a steady increase in domestic violence killings across the nation. In 2017, 1,070 people were killed in the United States in circumstances involving domestic or intimate partner violence. By 2021, the most recent year for which statistics are available, that number had skyrocketed to 1,800. Illinois\u2019 own tally reflects the national pattern. The total rose from 34 killings to 49 over that same period, according to the CDC tallies. Lawmakers and advocates in Illinois continue to look for ways to address the problems. Last month, after three failed attempts, the Illinois General Assembly passed Karina\u2019s Law, which will require police to confiscate firearms from anyone whose Illinois gun permit has been revoked because a judge issued an emergency order of protection against them. Pritzker signed the bill into law earlier this month. The bill is named after Karina Gonzalez, who in 2023 was shot to death along with her 15-year-old daughter in their Chicago home. Her estranged husband has been charged with the killings and has pleaded not guilty. Jesus Alvarez, Gonzalez\u2019s son, said he believes it\u2019s important not only to pass laws aimed at domestic violence, but to make sure they work as intended. There are obviously flaws in the system, Alvarez said. \u201cBut if you get these laws right, it should hopefully be a little bit easier for people, and they won\u2019t have to face the same kind of situation that I faced.\u201d With so many horrific examples of domestic violence taking place in Chicago and Cook County suburbs, the county\u2019s omission from the review effort remains glaring. Nonetheless, it was not an initial target as the statewide program launched, said Sara Block, a managing director at the nonprofit social service provider Ascend Justice and volunteer co-chair of the statewide effort. \u201cThere\u2019s just more dynamics to consider in Cook,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s not a priority. We very much hope that every single circuit will have one in the end. But some just aren\u2019t ready yet, and it will take more groundwork, it takes more education, more relationship building, before they are.\u201d The law enforcement and social service agencies asked to lead efforts in Cook County and elsewhere are already stretched for time and resources, said Jennifer Greene, advocacy director for nonprofit service provider Life Span and a member of the statewide overseeing committee. \u201cYou have to have someone who can run that team \u2014 who can handle administration and making contact, and there\u2019s just not any funding attached to it to do those things,\u201d she said. Officials and advocates in Winnebago County, in northwest Illinois, have found a way to overcome those and other obstacles. When state lawmakers passed legislation calling for the review panels, the city of Rockford\u2019s Office of Domestic and Community Violence Prevention saw an opportunity and took a leadership role. Forming a local committee wasn\u2019t a hard sell, said Jennifer Cacciapaglia, director of that Rockford office, which is in Winnebago County. A foundation grant to pay for staff and research time helped ease concerns about capacity. \u201cI think countywide there was a recognition that this could really create positive outcomes for people, so support has been wide,\u201d she said. Last month, she joined a small group of county advocates and officials to conduct the county\u2019s first reviews of domestic violence killings, focusing on two cases. Cacciapaglia said the panel\u2019s goal is to continue examining cases through the end of the year and submit findings to the statewide committee. In early February, the statewide committee came together for its bimonthly virtual meeting. These gatherings begin with a moment of reflection, to pause and be reminded of what\u2019s at stake by recalling a recent victim. Read More \u201cWe do this simply to keep survivors and those who have died due to domestic violence in the forefront of our minds,\u201d said Andrea Wilson, recently installed director of the committee, to the assembled group. The committee\u2019s attention turned to Tanisha Weeks. A judge had granted the 41-year-old mother an order of protection against her ex-boyfriend last December. She was shot dead in January in an apparent murder-suicide in Chicago involving an ex-boyfriend. Because the killing occurred in Cook County, there is no panel to review the circumstances.

Museums, universities and government agencies continued to make headway last year toward repatriating the remains of thousands of Native American ancestors to tribal nations after decades of slow progress drew national attention. Nowhere was the shift more apparent than at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the agency charged with enforcing the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which requires items and remains taken from Indigenous gravesites to be returned to tribes. The department\u2019s subagencies, including the National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management, collectively repatriated the remains of 1,366 Native American ancestors last year, more than a third of the number in its possession at the start of the year. The department\u2019s efforts reflected an awareness, documented in an internal memo in late 2023, that it has a crucial leadership role to play under NAGPRA. Only the Illinois State Museum, an institution that ProPublica has reported on in-depth, came close to repatriating as many, with the transfer of more than 1,320 remains excavated from a single site. The emphasis on repatriation increased in tandem with reporting by ProPublica in 2023 about failures to comply with the law. \u201cFor too long ancestors and Tribal cultural items have been disconnected from their communities and resting on museum shelves,\u201d Interior officials said in an October 2023 memo. In response to questions from ProPublica, an Interior spokesperson did not say whether the department\u2019s focus on repatriation will continue under Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency but pointed to new regulations finalized in 2023 that aimed to speed up the process. The regulations, which took effect last year, require institutions to defer more to tribal accounts of their histories and ties to the regions from which remains were removed; the rules also set new deadlines for institutions to comply with the law. In total, museums, universities and agencies across the country returned more than 10,300 Native American ancestors to tribes last year. The total makes 2024 the third-biggest year for the repatriation of ancestral remains under NAGPRA, according to an online ProPublica database that allows the public to look up the records of more than 600 museums and universities that must comply with the law. Today, ProPublica is updating the database to show repatriation progress through Jan. 6, 2025.

Was it helpful? Outside of the Interior Department and the Illinois State Museum, state universities also recorded significant progress. For example, California State University, Sacramento repatriated the remains of 873 Native Americans previously held in its collection. The progress made last year followed a record number of repatriations in 2023, when institutions returned 18,000 Native American ancestors. \u201cThe progress shows the regulations are working,\u201d said Shannon O\u2019Loughlin, the chief executive for the Association on American Indian Affairs, a nonprofit that advocates for Native American rights. Nearly 60% of ancestral remains reported as falling under NAGPRA over the years have now been repatriated, but that still leaves at least 90,000 that must be returned to tribes. The Interior Department has acknowledged that many of the human remains it must eventually repatriate have long been unaccounted for in federal inventories. Many of the department\u2019s collections are scattered across the country in university and museum repositories over which the federal government has no oversight, officials said. Agency staffers also said last year that they would need continued funding for their efforts \u2014 a factor that may prove challenging under an administration focused on cutting spending and staffing. \u201cWe need to sustain this work until all of the ancestors that are in DOI control have been repatriated,\u201d one Interior Department employee last year told the National NAGPRA Review Committee, a federal advisory board made up of museum, science and tribal representatives. Just over a year ago, the Interior Department had yet to repatriate more than 3,000 ancestors, many of which were excavated in 20th century archaeological digs and infrastructure projects on federal and tribal lands. The department\u2019s progress repatriating 1,366 Native American ancestors last year comes after top officials sent directives in late 2023 instructing Interior agencies to prioritize the work. Some agencies also set aside more money for repatriation work. \u201cIf you look at previous budgets, we weren\u2019t allocated any funding for NAGPRA,\u201d Tamara Billie, the chief of cultural resource management for the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs, told the National NAGPRA Review Committee last May. She estimated it could cost several million dollars over the next three to five years for the bureau to repatriate the hundreds of ancestors it has yet to reunite with tribes. Since Congress passed NAGPRA in 1990, federal staffers have tried to locate the collections excavated on federal and tribal lands, but they have often found that museums and universities transferred their holdings to other institutions without leaving much of a paper trail. Last year, officials said only a handful of repositories, like the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, had gone through their collections to determine what belonged to the federal government \u2014 an early step in the often long repatriation process. \u201cSome have submitted very detailed, in some cases itemized inventory information,\u201d said Bridget Ambler, with the Bureau of Land Management, during a National NAGPRA Review Committee hearing last year. \u201cBut to be honest, for the vast majority we\u2019re not fully aware of what the nature of those collections are and if they include human remains or NAGPRA cultural items.\u201d Under the new NAGPRA regulations, museums and universities had a deadline of January of this year to hand in lists of items in their facilities that should be included in federal inventories. The requirement resulted in museums and universities submitting roughly 1,000 new notices to the Interior Department, the manager of the National NAGPRA Program said during a recorded training last month. It\u2019s not clear how many ancestral remains are accounted for in those notices. At the Illinois State Museum, which holds the second-largest collection of Native American remains, leadership was already focused on improving their repatriation record. Then, a new state law, along with the Interior Department\u2019s updated regulations, went into effect. The state law, which followed ProPublica\u2019s reporting, gave tribes more control over reburials. It also established a fund for repatriation work, such as paying for tribal members to travel to the museum to consult on collections, and for the reburials of remains. Many of the remains held by the state museum came from a burial mound dug up in the 1920s by Don Dickson, a chiropractor. He turned the burial site into a roadside attraction. Over the years, Native Americans, whose tribes had been forcibly removed to other states, protested the exhibit that later became the Dickson Mounds Museum, a branch of the Illinois State Museum. The state eventually closed the burial mounds exhibit, but the museum kept the human remains, maintaining that they could not be traced to living people and therefore would not be repatriated. That was until this past year. On Feb. 24, 2024, the Illinois State Museum published a notice in the Federal Register saying that 1,325 ancestors and thousands of items buried with them were available to tribes for repatriation. As of the start of this year, the Illinois State Museum held the remains of an estimated 5,800 Native American ancestors. Only the Ohio History Connection now holds more unrepatriated human remains, over 7,900 in total, according to federal data. In the roughly three decades prior to 2024, the Columbus institution had returned fewer than 20 ancestors to tribes. But it showed signs of progress last year in making more than 150 ancestral remains, or roughly 2% of its skeletal collection reported under NAGPRA, available to be repatriated. In an email, a spokesperson for the museum said it expects to complete more repatriations in consultation with tribal partners, who have asked the museum \u201cnot to rush this critical work.\u201d As in Illinois, the Ohio institution\u2019s collections largely originate from centuries-old burial mounds in a state where tribal nations were forcibly removed. More state support for repatriation also could be on the horizon in Arizona. Last month, Gov. Katie Hobbs announced she would ask lawmakers for $7 million to support repatriation efforts at the Arizona State Museum. The museum on the University of Arizona campus in Tucson is a repository for the state and federal government. Over the years, records show, it has conducted repatriations but has yet to return more than half of its collection reported under NAGPRA \u2014 the remains of 2,600 ancestors total \u2014 to tribes mostly in the Southwest. \u201cThe hard-working staff at the museum have done their best to repatriate human remains and artifacts to tribes without any significant financial investment from the state,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat, said in prepared remarks to tribal leaders last month. \u201cIt is time for that to change. It is time for the state to take repatriation seriously.\u201d Read More One of the museums\u2019 challenges in trying to reach full compliance with the law stems from the fact that it continues to receive human remains because of its status as a state repository. Arizona medical examiners have sent the museum human remains that they come across in their investigations, including the ancestors of Native Americans. In some instances, looters have surrendered items and bones unearthed from graves, according to Jim Watson, associate director at the Arizona State Museum. (Looting violates federal laws.) \u201cWe will receive an individual or remains in the mail or objects from private citizens, particularly when individuals pass away and their relatives are going through their stuff,\u201d he told the NAGPRA Review Committee last spring. \u201cThey find a box in the garage or the attic, for example, and it says, \u2018from Arizona,\u2019 \u2018artifacts from Arizona,\u2019 \u2018artifacts from Phoenix\u2019 or \u2018ancestral remains.\u2019 So, they will ship them to the University of Arizona, often without contacting us first.\u201d He estimates the museum receives such packages two to three times per year.

        "text": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published. Hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, users spread a false claim on Facebook that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was paying a bounty for reports of undocumented people. \u201cBREAKING \u2014 ICE is allegedly offering $750 per illegal immigrant that you turn in through their tip form,\u201d read a post on a page called NO Filter Seeking Truth, adding, \u201cCash in folks.\u201d Check Your Fact, Reuters and other fact-checkers debunked the claim, and Facebook added labels to posts warning that they contained false information or missing context. ICE has a tip line but said it does not offer cash bounties. This spring, Meta plans to stop working with fact-checkers in the U.S. to label false or misleading content, the company said on Jan. 7. And if a post like the one about ICE goes viral, the pages that spread it could earn a cash bonus. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said in January that the company was removing or dialing back automated systems that reduce the spread of false information. At the same time, Meta is revamping a program that has paid bonuses to creators for content based on views and engagement, potentially pouring accelerant on the kind of false posts it once policed. The new Facebook Content Monetization program is currently invite-only, but Meta plans to make it widely available this year. The upshot: a likely resurgence of incendiary false stories on Facebook, some of them funded by Meta, according to former professional Facebook hoaxsters and a former Meta data scientist who worked on trust and safety. During Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

ProPublica identified 95 Facebook pages that regularly post made-up headlines designed to draw engagement \u2014 and, often, stoke political divisions. The pages, most of which are managed by people overseas, have a total of more than 7.7 million followers. After a review, Meta said it had removed 81 pages for being managed by fake accounts or misrepresenting themselves as American while posting about politics and social issues. Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesperson, declined to respond to specific questions, including whether any of the pages were eligible for or enrolled in the company\u2019s viral content payout program. The pages collected by ProPublica offer a sample of those that could be poised to cash in. Meta has made debunking viral hoaxes created for money a top priority for nearly a decade, with one executive calling this content the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d Meta has a policy against paying for content its fact-checkers label as false, but that rule will become irrelevant when the company stops working with them. Already, 404 Media found that overseas spammers are earning payouts using deceptive AI-generated content, including images of emaciated people meant to stoke emotion and engagement. Such content is rarely fact-checked because it doesn\u2019t make any verifiable claims. With the removal of fact-checks in the U.S., \u201cwhat is the protection now against viral hoaxes for profit?\u201d said Jeff Allen, the chief research officer of the nonprofit Integrity Institute and a former Meta data scientist. \u201cThe systems are designed to amplify the most salacious and inciting content,\u201d he added. In an exchange on Facebook Messenger, the manager of NO Filter Seeking Truth, which shared the false ICE post, told ProPublica that the page has been penalized so many times for sharing false information that Meta won\u2019t allow it to earn money under the current rules. The page is run by a woman based in the southern U.S., who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said she has received threats due to her posts. She said the news about the fact-checking system ending was \u201cgreat information.\u201d Clayton said Meta\u2019s community standards and content moderation teams are still active and reiterated the company\u2019s Jan. 7 statement that it is working to ensure it doesn\u2019t \u201cover-enforce\u201d its rules by mistakenly banning or suppressing content. Meta\u2019s changes mark a significant reversal of the company\u2019s approach to moderating false and misleading information, reframing the labeling or downranking of content as a form of censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Zuckerberg said in his announcement. His stance reflects the approach of Elon Musk after acquiring Twitter, now X, in 2022. Musk has made drastic cuts to the company\u2019s trust and safety team, reinstated thousands of suspended accounts including that of a prominent neo-Nazi and positioned Community Notes, which allows participating users to add context via notes appended to tweets, as the platform\u2019s key system for flagging false and misleading content. Zuckerberg has said Meta will replace fact-checkers and some automated systems in the U.S. with a version of the Community Notes system. A Jan. 7 update to a Meta policy page said that in the U.S. the company \u201cmay still reduce the distribution of certain hoax content whose spread creates a particularly bad user or product experience (e.g., certain commercial hoaxes).\u201d Clayton did not clarify whether posts with notes appended to them would be eligible for monetization. He provided links to academic papers that detail how crowdsourced fact-checking programs like Community Notes can be effective at identifying misinformation, building trust among users and addressing perceptions of bias. A 2023 ProPublica investigation, as well as reporting from Bloomberg, found that X\u2019s Community Notes failed to effectively address the misinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict. Reporting from the BBC and Agence France-Presse showed that X users who share false information have earned thousands of dollars thanks to X\u2019s content monetization program, which also rewards high engagement. Keith Coleman, X\u2019s vice president of product, previously told ProPublica that the analysis of Community Notes about the Israel-Hamas conflict did not include all of the relevant notes, and he said that the program \u201cis found helpful by people globally, across the political spectrum.\u201d Allen said it takes time, resources and oversight to scale up crowdsourced fact-checking systems. Meta\u2019s decision to scrap fact-checking before giving the new approach time to prove itself is risky, he said. \u201cWe could in theory have a Community Notes program that was as effective, if not more effective, than the fact-checking program,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to turn all these things off before you have the Community Notes thing in place definitely feels like we\u2019re explicitly going to have a moment with little guardrails.\u201d Before Facebook began cracking down on content in late 2016, American fake news peddlers and spammers based in North Macedonia and elsewhere cashed in on viral hoaxes that deepened political divisions and played on people\u2019s fears. One American, Jestin Coler, ran a network of sites that earned money from hoax news stories for nearly a decade, including the infamous and false viral headline from 2016 \u201cFBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide.\u201d He previously told NPR that he started the sites as a way to \u201cinfiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right.\u201d Coler said he earned five figures a month from the sites, which he operated in his spare time. When people clicked on the links to the stories in their news feed, they landed on websites full of ads, which generated revenue for Coler. That\u2019s become a tougher business model since Meta has made story links less visible on Facebook in recent years. Facebook\u2019s new program to pay publishers directly for viral content could unlock a fresh revenue stream for hoaxsters. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same formula to get people riled up. It seems like it could just go right back to those days, like overnight,\u201d Coler told ProPublica in a phone interview. He said he left the Facebook hoax business years ago and won\u2019t return. In January, ProPublica compiled a list of pages that had been previously cited for posting hoaxes and false content and discovered dozens more through domain and content searches. The pages posted false headlines designed to spark controversy, such as \u201cLia Thomas Admits: \u2018I Faked Being Trans to Expose How Gullible the Left Is\u2019\u201d and \u201cElon Musk announced that he has acquired MSNBC for $900 million to put an end to toxic programming.\u201d The Musk headline was paired with an AI-generated image of him holding a contract with the MSNBC logo. It generated over 11,000 reactions, shares and comments. Most of the pages are managed by accounts outside of the U.S., including in North Macedonia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, according to data from Facebook. Many of these pages use AI-generated images to illustrate their made-up headlines. One network of overseas-run pages is connected to the site SpaceXMania.com, an ad-funded site filled with hoax articles like \u201cElon Musk Confronts Beyonc\u00e9 Publicly: \u2018Stop Pretending to Be Country, It\u2019s Just Not You.\u2019\u201d SpaceX Fanclub, the network\u2019s largest Facebook page, has close to 220,000 followers and labels its content as satire. One of its recent posts was a typo-laden AI-generated image of a sign that said, \u201cThere Are Only 2 2 Genders And Will Ban Atheletes From Women Sports \u2014 President.\u201d SpaceXMania.com\u2019s terms and conditions page says it\u2019s owned by Funky Creations LTD, a United Kingdom company registered to Muhammad Shabayer Shaukat, a Pakistani national. ProPublica sent questions to the site and received an email response signed by Tim Lawson, who said he\u2019s an American based in Florida who works with Shaukat. (ProPublica was unable to locate a person by that name in public records searches, based on the information he provided.) \u201cOur work involves analyzing the latest trends and high-profile news related to celebrities and shaping it in a way that appeals to a specific audience \u2014 particularly conservatives and far-right groups who are predisposed to believe certain narratives,\u201d the email said. Lawson said they earn between $500 and $1,500 per month from web ads and more than half of the traffic comes from people clicking on links on Facebook. The pages are not currently enrolled in the invitation-only Facebook Content Monetization program, according to Lawson. The SpaceXMania pages identified by ProPublica were recently taken offline. Lawson denied that they were removed by Meta and said he deactivated the pages \u201cdue to some security reasons.\u201d Meta declined to comment. Read More It remains to be seen how hoax page operators will fare as Meta\u2019s algorithmic reversals take hold and the U.S. fact-checking program grinds to a halt. But some Facebook users are already taking advantage of the loosened guardrails. Soon after Zuckerberg announced the changes, people spread a fake screenshot of a Bloomberg article headlined, \u201cThe spark from Zuckerberg\u2019s electric penis pump, might be responsible for the LA fires.\u201d \u201cCommunity note: verified true,\u201d wrote one commenter.

        "text": "Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Justin Spike, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Justin Spike, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s leader will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday at a pivotal moment for his country, one that hinges on whether he can persuade Trump to provide some form of U.S. backing for Ukraine\u2019s security against any future Russian aggression. President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are expected to hold a news conference at 1 p.m. EST. Watch live in our player above. During his trip to Washington, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s delegation is expected to sign a landmark economic agreement with the U.S. aimed at financing the reconstruction of war-damaged Ukraine, a deal that would closely tie the two countries together for years to come. WATCH: Trump meets with British PM amid tensions with Europe over Ukraine and tariffs Though the deal, which is seen as a step toward ending the three-year war, references the importance of Ukraine\u2019s security, it leaves that to a separate agreement to be discussed between the two leaders \u2014 talks that are likely to commence Friday. As Ukrainian forces hold out against slow but steady advances by Russia\u2019s larger and better-equipped army, leaders in Kyiv have pushed to ensure a potential U.S.-brokered peace plan would include guarantees for the country\u2019s future security. Many Ukrainians fear that a hastily negotiated peace \u2014 especially one that makes too many concessions to Russian demands \u2014 would allow Moscow to rearm and consolidate its forces for a future invasion after current hostilities cease. According to the preliminary economic agreement, seen by The Associated Press, the U.S. and Ukraine will establish a co-owned, jointly managed investment fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50 percent of future revenues from natural resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons and other extractable materials. WATCH: Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmer hold news conference A more detailed agreement on establishing the fund will be drawn up once the preliminary one is signed. Trump, a Republican, has framed the emerging deal as a chance for Kyiv to compensate the U.S. for wartime aid sent under his predecessor, President Joe Biden, a Democrat. But Zelenskyy has remained firm that specific assurances for Ukraine\u2019s security must accompany any agreement giving U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s resources. On Wednesday, he said the agreement \u201cmay be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?\u201d Trump remains noncommittal about any American security guarantees. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make security guarantees \u2026 very much,\u201d Trump told reporters this week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Europe do that.\u201d WATCH: Ukraine marks 3 years since start of Russia\u2019s invasion as Trump\u2019s stance raises concerns If a truce can be reached, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed to send troops for a potential peacekeeping mission to Ukraine to ensure that fighting between Ukraine and Russia doesn\u2019t flare up again. Both leaders traveled to Washington this week before the Zelenskyy visit to discuss with Trump the potential peacekeeping mission and other concerns about the war. White House officials are skeptical that Britain and France can assemble enough troops from across Europe, at least at this moment, to deploy a credible peacekeeping mission to Kyiv. It will likely take a \u201cconsensual peace settlement\u201d between Russia and Ukraine before many nations would be willing to provide such forces, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. Zelenskyy and European officials have no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in such a mission. But Starmer and others are trying to make the case that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case the truce is breached. WATCH: Trump says he believes Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine \u201cYou\u2019ve created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal \u2014 a deal that I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world,\u201d Starmer told Trump. \u201cThat is the prize. But we have to get it right.\u201d Zelenskyy has been vague on exactly what kinds of security guarantees would be suitable for his country, and while he continues to advocate for Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership in NATO, he has also suggested a similar security arrangement would suffice. But Trump on Wednesday said Ukraine \u201ccould forget about\u201d joining the Western military alliance. Still, Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting with Trump, their first since the U.S. leader\u2019s inauguration in January, is seen in Kyiv as a diplomatic win for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said being able to meet personally with Trump before Russian President Vladimir Putin does \u201cis a good signal.\u201d Zelenskyy said he hopes to discuss whether the U.S. plans to halt its military aid to Ukraine and, if so, whether Kyiv would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for the purchase of weapons and whether Washington plans to lift sanctions on Moscow. Fears that Trump could broker a peace deal with Russia that is unfavorable to Ukraine have been amplified by recent precedent-busting actions by his administration. Trump held a lengthy phone call with Putin, and U.S. officials met with their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia without inviting European or Ukrainian leaders \u2014 both dramatic breaks with previous U.S. policy to isolate Putin over his invasion. Trump later seemed to falsely blame Ukraine for starting the war, and called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d for not holding elections after the end of his regular term last year, though Ukrainian law prohibits elections while martial law is in place. As Zelenskyy seeks to lower the temperature with the U.S. while in Washington, American officials are saying the economic deal, if implemented, would itself provide a measure of security to Ukraine through the presence of U.S. investments on its territory. On Wednesday, Trump said the U.S. working on mineral extraction in Ukraine would amount to \u201cautomatic security because nobody\u2019s going to be messing around with our people when we\u2019re there.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for Ukraine too, because they get us over there and we\u2019re going to be working over there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be on the land.\u201d That perspective is echoed by the text of the economic agreement, which says the U.S. \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.\u201d Washington, it continues, has \u201ca long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d Spike reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

The People\u2019s Union USA calls the 24 hours of spending abstinence set to start at midnight an \u201ceconomic blackout,\u201d a term that has since been shared and debated on social media. The activist movement said it also plans to promote weeklong consumer boycotts of particular companies, including Walmart and Amazon. READ MORE: After Target backs away from diversity programs, civil rights activists call for a boycott Other activists, faith-based leaders and consumers already are organizing boycotts to protest companies that have scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and to oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Some faith leaders are encouraging their congregations to refrain from shopping at Target, one of the companies backing off DEI efforts, during the 40 days of Lent that begin Wednesday. Here are some details about the various events and experts\u2019 thoughts on whether having consumers keep their wallets closed is an effective tool for influencing the positions corporations take. The People\u2019s Union USA, which takes credit for initiating the no-spend day, was founded by John Schwarz, a meditation teacher who lives near the Chicago area, according to his social media accounts. The organization\u2019s website said it\u2019s not tied to a political party but stands for all people. Requests for comment sent to the group\u2019s email address this week did not receive a reply. The planned blackout is scheduled to run from 12 a.m. EST through 11:59 p.m. EST on Friday. The activist group advised customers to abstain from making any purchases, whether in store or online, but particularly not from big retailers or chains. It wants participants to avoid fast food and filling their car gas tanks, and says shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support a local small business and try not to use a credit or debit card. People\u2019s Union plans another broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it\u2019s also organizing boycotts targeting specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns. There are a number of boycotts being planned, particularly aimed at Target. The discounter, which has backed diversity and inclusion efforts aimed at uplifting Black and LGBTQ+ people in the past, announced in January it was rolling back its DEI initiatives. A labor advocacy group called We Are Somebody, led by Nina Turner, launched a boycott of Target on February 1 to coincide with Black History Month. Meanwhile, an Atlanta-area pastor, the Rev. Jamal Bryant, organized a website called targetfast.org to recruit Christians for a a 40-day Target boycott starting March 5, which marks Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Other faith leaders have endorsed the protest. WATCH: How North Carolina\u2019s bathroom law sparked a business backlash The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization, announced in late January it would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning their diversity, equity and inclusion pledges. The organization formed a commission to identify potential candidates. \u201cDonald Trump can cut federal DEI programs to the bone, he can claw back federal money to expand diversity, but he cannot tell us what grocery store we shop at,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement posted on the National Action Network\u2019s website. Some retailers may feel a slight pinch from Friday\u2019s broad \u201cblackout,\u201d which is taking place in a tough economic environment, experts said. Renewed inflation worries and Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on imported goods already have had an effect on consumer sentiment. \u201cThe (market share) pie is just so big,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to have your slices get smaller. Consumers are spending more money on food. And that means there\u2019s more pressure on general merchandise or discretionary products.\u201d Still, Cohen thinks the overall impact may be limited, with any meaningful sales declines more likely to surface in liberal-leaning coastal regions and big cities. Anna Tuchman, a marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said she thinks the economic blackout will likely make a dent in daily retail sales but won\u2019t be sustainable. \u201cI think this is an opportunity for consumers to show that they have a voice on a single day,\u201d she said. \u201dI think it\u2019s unlikely that we would see long-run sustained decreases in economic activity supported by this boycott.\u201d Other boycotts have produced different results. Target saw a drop in sales in the spring and summer quarter of 2023 that the discounter attributed in part to customer backlash over a collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities for Pride Month. As a result, Target didn\u2019t carry Pride merchandise in all of its stores the following year. Tuchman studied the impact of a boycott against Goya Foods during the summer of 2020 after the company\u2019s CEO praised Trump. But her study, based on sales from research firm Numerator, found the brand saw a sales increase driven by first-time Goya buyers who were disproportionately from heavily Republican areas. However, the revenue bump proved temporary; Goya had no detectable sales increase after three weeks, Tuchman said.

Sales plummeted in 2023 after the brand sent a commemorative can to a transgender influencer. Bud Light\u2019s sales still haven\u2019t fully recovered, according to alcohol consulting company Bump Williams. Tuchman thinks a reason is because there were plenty of other beers that the brand\u2019s mostly conservative customer base could buy to replace Bud Light. Afya Evans, a political and image consultant in Atlanta, said she would make a point of shopping on Friday but will focus on small businesses and Black-owned brands. Evans is aware of other boycotts but she said she liked this one because she believes it could have some effect on sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a broader thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see what the impact is. Let everybody participate. And plan from there.\u201d AP Business Writer Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

On the agenda is the brutal war in Ukraine and Trump's efforts to make a deal with the invader, Russia's Vladimir Putin. Lisa Desjardins reports. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Welcome to the \"News Hour.\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer continued a week of Oval Office diplomacy today, arriving at the White House for meetings with President Donald Trump and his team. Amna Nawaz: Starmer is the second of three critical European allies to meet with the president this week. French President Macron was here on Monday, and Ukraine'sLisa Desjardins president arrives tomorrow. On the agenda today, as with all three leaders, the brutal war in Ukraine, and President Trump's efforts to make a deal with the invader, Russia's Vladimir Putin. Lisa Desjardins reports. : As U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer pulled up to the White House today\u2026 Question: President Trump, can you get a peace deal done on Ukraine? Donald Trump, President of the United States: Yes. Lisa Desjardins: \u2026 Ukraine was top of mind before he and President Trump even got inside. In the Oval Office: Donald Trump: We're going to be discussing many things today. Lisa Desjardins: Starmer, the Labor Party leader, made his pitch for the U.S. to include Ukraine and all of Europe in negotiations. Keir Starmer, British Prime Minister: We want to work with you to make sure that peace deal is enduring, that it lasts, that it's a deal that goes down as a historic deal that nobody breaches. Lisa Desjardins: But for his tougher asks, Starmer brought a sweetener, a letter direct from King Charles inviting Trump for a historic second state visit seven years after his first. Donald Trump: The answer is yes. We have our wonderful first lady, Melania, and myself. The answer is yes. Lisa Desjardins: From there, Trump gave a show of confidence that a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow would hold. Starmer, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, have both agreed to send troops to the region to keep the peace if a deal is reached. The U.S., on the other hand: Donald Trump: I don't think we're going to even be necessary, but I don't think there will be any problem with keeping the deal with the security. Lisa Desjardins: Earlier this week, Starmer announced U.K.'s defense budget will rise to 2.5 percent by 2027, a move clearly aimed at pleasing Trump. Donald Trump: We get along very famously, as you would say. Lisa Desjardins: But, as Trump praised Starmer, he indicated he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin to stick to any peace deal. Donald Trump: I have known him for a long time now, and I think he will \u2014 I don't believe he's going to violate his word. Lisa Desjardins: That in stark contrast to how Starmer and the U.K. has viewed Putin, as the press noted. Question: It sounds as though one of you completely trusts President Putin, and one of you doesn't trust him an inch. Lisa Desjardins: At the same time, Trump played up his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who will be in Washington tomorrow to sign off on a critical minerals deal. Reporters pointed out comments Trump clearly made about Zelenskyy online just last week. Question: Mr. President, do you still that Mr. Zelenskyy is a dictator? Donald Trump: Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Lisa Desjardins: Trump stood by his push for tariffs, including with Europe. And, throughout, both leaders stressed the importance of a strong U.S.-U.K. alliance. But Trump not so subtly reminded his counterpart about their relative strength. Donald Trump: Could you take on Russia by yourselves? Keir Starmer: Well\u2026 (Laughter) Lisa Desjardins: Awkward moments became more open disagreement when a reporter asked about Vice President Vance's criticisms of the U.K. Earlier this month, Vance decried the U.K. as censoring free speech, particularly religious expression. Today, Vance seemed focused on the Internet and how to handle inflammatory, sometimes threatening speech, arguing British policy blocking some was a U.S. concern. J.D. Vance, Vice President of the United States: What the British do in their own country is up to them, but also affect American technology companies and by extension American citizens. So that is something that we will talk about today at lunch. Lisa Desjardins: Starmer immediately responded with a polite, back off. Keir Starmer: Well, no, I mean, certainly we wouldn't want to reach across U.S. citizens, and we don't, and that's absolutely right. But in relation to free speech in the U.K., I'm very proud of our history there. This has been a very good and very productive visit. Lisa Desjardins: Side by side at an afternoon news conference, the two leaders continued working on the latest version\u2026 Donald Trump: Thank you. Lisa Desjardins: \u2026 of their country's special relationship. For the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.

        "text": "Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Hannah Fingerhut, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Hannah Fingerhut, Associated Press Leave your feedback DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa moved to remove gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life. The Iowa House approved the bill that would\u00a0strip the state civil rights code of protections\u00a0based on gender identity, less than an hour after the state Senate backed the legislation. First introduced last week, the measure raced through the legislative process. READ MORE: Republican-led states emboldened to continue rolling back trans rights as Democrats struggle with response Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at the public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill. Protesters that watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the House adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed. The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d The measure would be the first legislative action removing nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. The legislation now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has been supportive of efforts to limit gender identity protections. The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came on the same day the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s\u00a0hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery. Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status. Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers. Iowa Republicans say their changes are intended to reinforce the state\u2019s ban on sports participation and\u00a0public bathroom\u00a0access for transgender students. If approved, the bill would go to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed those policies into law. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. WATCH: Transgender lawmaker Leigh Finke on the political backlash surrounding trans rights V Fixmer-Oraiz, a county supervisor in eastern Johnson County, was the first to testify against the bill at the public hearing. A trans Iowan, they said they have faced their \u201cfair share of discrimination\u201d already and worried that the bill will expose trans Iowans to even more. \u201cIs it not the role of government to affirm rather than to deny law-abiding citizens their inalienable rights?\u201d Fixmer-Oraiz said. \u201cThe people of Iowa deserve better.\u201d Among those speaking in support of the bill was Shellie Flockhart of Dallas Center, who said she is in favor as a woman and a mother, a \u201cdefender of women\u2019s rights\u201d and someone \u201cwho believes in the truth of God\u2019s creation.\u201d \u201cIdentity does not change biology,\u201d Flockhart said. About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes. Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0has expressly rejected\u00a0the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity. Several Republican-led legislatures are also\u00a0pushing to enact more laws\u00a0this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following\u00a0an executive order\u00a0from President Donald Trump. Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from\u00a0military service\u00a0and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s\u00a0sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being\u00a0challenged in court.

        "text": "Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Jill Lawless, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Jill Lawless, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press\n\n\n                    Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer used a visit to Washington on Thursday to press President Donald Trump not to abandon Ukraine as he looks to find a quick endgame to Russia\u2019s bloody invasion of its neighbor. Watch Trump and Starmer\u2019s news conference in the player above. With a mix of flattery and frank talk, the center-left Starmer made the case to the Republican president to remain cautious as he goes about ending the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. The British premier started the visit by delivering an invitation from King Charles III to come to Scotland for a \u201chistoric\u201d state visit \u2014 noting it was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d honor since Trump already had been given the royal treatment by Queen Elizabeth II during his first term. WATCH: Trump meets with UK leader Starmer, receives invite from King Charles III to visit Scotland \u201cYou\u2019ve created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal \u2014 a deal that I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world,\u201d Starmer told Trump. \u201cThat is the prize. But we have to get it right.\u201d Trump said that talks to end the grinding war are \u201cvery well advanced\u201d but also cautioned that there is only a narrow window to get a deal done. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all,\u201d Trump warned. Starmer\u2019s visit came after French President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington earlier this week to make a similar case to Trump, and a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to visit the White House. The British leader leaned into the idea that Trump was the glue to maintaining the peace in Ukraine should the three-year war end. The press by Starmer and Macron this week reflects the\u00a0mounting concern felt by much of Europe\u00a0that Trump\u2019s aggressive push to find an end to the war signals his willingness to concede too much to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some of Trump\u2019s comments during Starmer\u2019s visit may only add to Europe\u2019s anxiety. The American leader expressed confidence that Putin won\u2019t press to restart the war if a truce can be reached. \u201cI think he\u2019ll keep his word,\u201d Trump said of Putin. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him, I\u2019ve known him for a long time now, we had to go through the Russian hoax together.\u201d The mention of \u201cRussia hoax\u201d is a reference to the FBI and Justice Department special counsel investigation that examined whether Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign illegally coordinated with Russia to sway the outcome of the U.S. election. Special counsel Robert Mueller found that although the Trump campaign welcomed Russia\u2019s help in the form of the release of hacked emails stolen from Democrats, there was insufficient evidence to prove that the campaign had colluded with Moscow. Trump\u2019s rapprochement with Russia has unsettled America\u2019s historic allies in Europe. They have found themselves on their heels with Trump returning to the White House with a determination to dramatically make over U.S. foreign policy to correspond with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d world view. The Trump administration\u00a0held talks last week with Russia\u00a0without Ukrainian or other European allies represented. And this week, the\u00a0U.S. refused to sign on to resolutions\u00a0at the United Nations blaming Russia for the war. The drifting White House view of Ukraine under Trump is leading to a tectonic shift in transatlantic relations. Starmer applauded Trump\u2019s push to end Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but also urged that \u201cit can\u2019t be peace that rewards the aggressor.\u201d \u201cHistory must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,\u201d Starmer said. At a White House meeting Friday, Trump and\u00a0Zelenskyy\u00a0are\u00a0expected to sign off\u00a0on a contentious agreement that would give the U.S. access to\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals, which are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. Zelenskyy had chafed at a deal without specific security guarantees from Washington. READ MORE: Trump announces Zelenskyy visit to sign deal on Ukraine\u2019s minerals Trump remains noncommittal about any coming American security guarantees, and underscored that Russia would think twice about attacking Ukraine should the U.S. build an economic footprint in Ukraine to extract critical minerals \u201cWe are a backstop because we\u2019ll be over there, we\u2019ll be working in the country,\u201d Trump said. If a truce can be reached, Starmer and\u00a0Macron\u00a0have agreed to send troops for\u00a0a potential peacekeeping mission\u00a0to Ukraine to ensure that fighting between Ukraine and Russia doesn\u2019t flare up again. But White House officials are skeptical that Britain and France can assemble enough troops from across Europe, at least at this moment, to deploy a credible peacekeeping mission to Kyiv. Zelenskyy, while en route to Washington, met on Thursday with Ireland\u2019s prime minister,\u00a0Miche\u00e1l Martin,\u00a0who said he told Zelenskyy that Ireland is open to helping, including sending peacekeepers to Ukraine. Zelenskyy and European officials have no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in such a mission. But Starmer and others are trying to make the case that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case of breaches of a truce. Trump is also looking at the moment as an opportunity to potentially reopen economic relations with Russia after three years of U.S.-led sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion. Starmer is hosting a Sunday meeting in the United Kingdom of international leaders that will focus on Ukraine, and Zelenskyy is expected to attend. The prime minister also announced plans this week for the U.K. to bolster defense spending, something that should sit well with Trump, who has been critical that European allies are spending too little on defense. Starmer\u2019s government\u00a0will increase military spending to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2027, years earlier than expected, and aim to reach 3 percent by 2035. \u201cThe disaster in Ukraine shows exactly why it\u2019s so important for the United Kingdom and other NATO partners to make large investments in their defense capabilities,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re raising it quite a bit, which is a great thing to do for your country. It\u2019s a great thing to do. It\u2019s sad that we need that, but probably need that.\u201d Associated Press writers Panagiotis Pylas in London and Eric Tucker contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to reflect that Emmanuel Macron is the French president, not prime minister.

        "text": "Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. David Klepper, Associated Press\n\n\n                    David Klepper, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic lawmakers are demanding answers from Elon Musk about whether staffers at his Department of Government Efficiency have shared national security secrets over insecure communication channels. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia were joined by several other Democrats on a letter Thursday that asserts that reckless actions by Musk and Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting initiative present a threat to national security by exposing secrets about America\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies. WATCH NOW: A look at the misleading and incorrect claims on DOGE\u2019s \u2018wall of receipts\u2019 Such information would present huge advantages to U.S. adversaries by giving them critical information about Washington\u2019s defense priorities and the resources assigned to various missions and objectives, the lawmakers said. Without going through the normal security procedures, staffers hired by Musk have gained access to a variety of sensitive government databases that contain private information about many Americans and their businesses, along with employment and operational information used by the government. In many cases that includes classified information, such as the precise number of employees working for various intelligence agencies. According to the letter, DOGE staffers in recent weeks have used unauthorized servers and unknown artificial intelligence programs to analyze and store the data, and shared the information over unsecure channels, raising the risk that a foreign nation, criminal group or inside threat could gain access or misuse the material. The lawmakers also noted that despite assurances the DOGE website will not reveal information from intelligence agencies, material from the National Reconnaissance Office was easily found, the lawmakers said. They expressed concerns that DOGE may be cutting spending and personnel without understanding the national security implications until it is too late. They pointed to a recent incident in which the government tried to bring back workers it had fired who worked on nuclear weapon programs. \u201cDOGE employees do not appear to fully understand much of the information to which they have been given unfettered access and given the cavalier and incompetent ways that they have handled this data, these individuals represent a clear threat to national security and the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. In their letter, the Democrats demanded information about DOGE staffing and security protocols and how the data has been used, and potentially misused, since DOGE began operations earlier this year. Musk and Trump have defended DOGE\u2019s work, saying it\u2019s led to billions in savings. DOGE and the White House did not immediately respond Thursday to questions seeking comment about the lawmakers\u2019 letter.

        "text": "Since Donald Trump took office, the news cycle has hit a frenetic new pitch. The daily torrent of push alerts, breaking news, and viral outrages has been relentless \u2014 and exhausting. It\u2019s hard to tell what is real and what\u2019s just bluster.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? America is still the most influential country in the world, for better or worse. by  Zack Beauchamp Vox reader Jo N\u00ed Coinnigh asks: Why do American politics (especially the presidential election) affect not just the US, but the entire world? On one level, the answer to this question is very simple: The United States is the most powerful country in the world. So what happens in Washington matters to the world in the same way that decisions in Rome during the height of its imperial era mattered to everyone who lived near its borders. But I worry the comparison to Rome actually undersells the importance of America to the world. Because while the ancient world was more interconnected than most appreciate, it was nothing compared to the world we live in today. Partly, of course, this is a matter of technology \u2014 starting with the most dangerous weapons ever made by humanity. Post-World War II politics have been largely defined by the specter of nuclear war, a conflict so devastating that it cannot conceivably be won. Were the United States to go to war with Russia or China \u2014 or even North Korea \u2014 any use of nuclear weapons would have consequences going well beyond the targets. A full-on nuclear exchange between large nuclear powers could even undermine the foundations of life on Earth itself. But even if we aren\u2019t talking about the worst case \u2014 and, frankly, improbable \u2014 scenarios, the United States is still a global hegemon, setting the terms of political engagement for nearly everyone on the planet. It is the most powerful country in the NATO alliance, which is the largest alliance system in global history. The US military has bases on every populated continent. The dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, the most widely accepted form of financial exchange and thus the backbone of the global economy. American diplomats play a role in sensitive negotiations around the world, even those that may not directly affect US interests. To see how changing American policies could affect the world, let\u2019s consider a number of specific policy issues directly raised by the new Trump administration: I am not saying that, in each of these cases, the worst-case scenario will come to pass. Individually, the odds of a global economic meltdown, a new pandemic, warming exceeding 4 degrees centigrade, or a third world war remain relatively low. Rather, the point is to illustrate just how pivotal the United States is to all of each of those issues. As the world\u2019s preeminent military, economic, diplomatic, scientific, and cultural power, its policy decisions invariably have implications for everyone on the planet. Even issues that seem purely domestic, like subsidies for green energy production, can have profound implications for the global marketplace and (by extension) which technologies and firms are financially viable on a global scale. This may surprise you, given all the talk of a rising China. But in fact, the best available research and evidence suggests that China remains quite a bit behind the United States in global power \u2014 closer than any other country, but still solidly in second place. Militarily, China is a threat to America\u2019s positions in East Asia but can\u2019t compare to America anywhere else. Economically, China\u2019s economy is stuck in a deepening rut that its leaders can\u2019t seem to fix; President Xi Jinping recently announced a new economic program to try to revitalize it. Demographically, China\u2019s population is declining rapidly while America\u2019s continues to grow thanks to (gulp) immigration. Politically, Chinese-style authoritarian capitalism enjoys only a tiny fraction of the international legitimacy that American-style liberal democracy does. Diplomatically, Washington commands a far larger and more powerful alliance network than Beijing. What we\u2019ve seen in the past few years is relative decline \u2014 China becoming stronger as the United States weakens. But absolutes still matter. And in absolute terms, the United States remains well above China on nearly every meaningful metric of global power. What happens in Washington is simply more important than what happens in Beijing, and likely will remain so for quite some time \u2014 perhaps even indefinitely. For better or worse, America is still No. 1 \u2014 and, as such, its policies take on outsize significance for everyone.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? by  Vox Staff President Donald Trump\u2019s first weeks back in the White House have been nothing short of dizzying. He kicked off his second presidency with a fury of policy actions \u2014 imposing (then postponing) tariffs on Canada and Mexico; barring transgender people from serving and enlisting in the military; and eliminating many US foreign aid programs. He has revealed plans to purge the FBI of his perceived enemies and provided sweeping pardons to his insurrectionist supporters. And he\u2019s vowed to launch the \u201clargest deportation program in American history.\u201d Trump appears intent on remaking the executive branch as he sees fit \u2014 empowering ally Elon Musk to push aside civil servants, wind down entire agencies, and generally strike terror into the federal workforce. The news is changing rapidly. Follow here for the latest updates, analysis, and explainers about Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. Bryan Walsh Here\u2019s a very naive and idealistic account of how companies train their AI models: They want to create the most useful and powerful model possible, but they\u2019ve talked with experts who worry about making it a lot easier for people to commit (and get away with) serious crimes, or with empowering, say, an ISIS bioweapons program. So they build in some censorship to prevent the model from giving detailed advice about how to kill people \u2014 and especially how to kill tens of thousands of people. If you ask Google\u2019s Gemini \u201chow do I kill my husband,\u201d it begs you not to do it and suggests domestic violence hotlines; if you ask it how to kill a million people in a terrorist attack, it explains that terrorism is wrong. Christian Paz There\u2019s an intra-MAGA fight playing out right now over Andrew Tate, a far-right influencer and self-described misogynist who arrived in Florida on Thursday morning. Tate, along with his brother Tristan, had been awaiting trial in Romania on human trafficking charges, but they were allowed to return to the United States overnight. Some of his supporters in the online right celebrated: It was a triumph for the rule of law, the conservative commentator Candace Owens posted on X. But some conservatives have criticized his release and the alleged role of the Trump administration in securing his return. Umair Irfan Editor\u2019s note, February 27, 4:50 pm ET: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has begun to lay off probationary employees, according to a source inside the agency not authorized to speak to the press. Laid-off staffers were told that \u201cyou are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs,\u201d according to an email obtained by Vox. The story below, published on February 21 before the announcement, explains how the Trump administration has been preparing to cut staffing at NOAA and what that means for weather forecasting and climate research. Naveena Sadasivam This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, because they meet the Clean Air Act\u2019s definition of air pollutants. It was a pivotal moment for climate regulation in the United States. That ruling led the EPA to find that six key greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, endanger public health and welfare. Ian Millhiser On Wednesday night, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted a lower court order, which would have required the Trump administration to make approximately $2 billion in foreign aid payments that it had stopped as part of a broader attack on the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It\u2019s important not to read too much significance into Roberts\u2019s temporary order in this case, known as Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. Judges often have the power to hit \u201cpause\u201d on a case while they take more time to figure out how the law requires them to act \u2014 indeed, many of the lower court judges who\u2019ve halted Trump administration policies relied on similar authority when they did so. It\u2019s likely that Roberts issued Wednesday\u2019s order to give himself and his colleagues more time to consider the questions presented by the AIDS Vaccine case. Aja Romano Andrew Tate made his name as a misogynist podcast star, but has more recently been known as an alleged rapist and human trafficker as he awaits criminal trial in Romania with his brother Tristan. Last week, the Financial Times reported that the Trump administration, through special envoy Richard Grenell, had tried to pressure the Romanian government to lift travel restrictions on the brothers. On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Romanian authorities had lifted the travel restrictions on the brothers and that the Tates had flown to the United States. Andrew Tate, whose online course \u201cHustler\u2019s University\u201d morphed into a platform with nearly a million users, became a powder keg among far-right media influencers in the early 2020s due to his explicitly sexist worldview and its profound influence over millions of teen boys and young men. Christian Paz Voters in Germany maintained a few global trends this past weekend: They kicked out incumbents, their youth moved to the right, and they delivered another surprise. Their radical, anti-immigrant party (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, or AfD) finished second, and was likely boosted by some LGBTQ voters. The rightward shift of gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters is a dynamic playing out across western Europe. In the UK, France, and now Germany, gay voters or their allies are backing far-right or nativist political parties at growing rates. That queer shift to the right doesn\u2019t seem to be materializing in the United States, however. During the 2024 election, LGBTQ voters actually got more Democratic than in 2020.

The former field hockey coach and NFL royalty had dethroned Joe Rogan in his own domain \u2014 and his fans could not believe it. Nicole Narea Elon Musk\u2019s cut-first, aim-later run through the federal government is predicated on the idea that the nation\u2019s finances are in crisis and that it needs to drastically cut spending to recover. But at least one cut Musk\u2019s team is planning will actually cost the government money, worsening the supposed fiscal crisis that the Trump administration is claiming is a national emergency. That\u2019s Musk\u2019s plan to cut jobs at the US Internal Revenue Service. Benji Jones In the open grasslands of South Dakota, not far from the dramatic rock formations of Badlands National Park, lives one of the continent\u2019s cutest, fiercest, and rarest animals: the black-footed ferret. Black-footed ferrets, weasel-like animals with distinctive dark bands around their eyes and black feet, are ruthless little hunters. At night, they dive into burrows in pursuit of juicy prairie dogs, their primary food source. Without prairie dogs, these ferrets would not survive. Ian Millhiser The proper term for a Supreme Court session where the justices hear verbal presentations by lawyers is an \u201coral argument,\u201d but Wednesday\u2019s hearing in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services hardly qualified as an argument. Everyone, on every side of the case, agreed that a strange rule governing employment discrimination suits in some parts of the country needs to go. As Justice Neil Gorsuch quipped at one point, there appears to be \u201cradical agreement.\u201d Andrew Prokop Will Donald Trump succeed in his long-held goal of weaponizing the Justice Department against his political enemies? Much of the answer will depend on the man he\u2019s appointed to head the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington, DC. That\u2019s longtime conservative activist Ed Martin \u2014 or, \u201cEagle Ed Martin,\u201d per his X handle. Nicole Narea \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d has long been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s signature slogans. But now that billionaire Elon Musk is orchestrating mass layoffs of federal workers, it\u2019s not clear that rhetoric translates into popular policy. At town halls from Missouri to Georgia to Oklahoma, constituents of Republican lawmakers have shown up to protest Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s aggressive efforts to slash government spending. More than 20,000 workers have been laid off so far, and almost 1 million people who reside in states that Trump won in 2024 could ultimately be affected. Abdallah Fayyad Since his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has posed a serious threat to American democracy. From the start, he refused to commit to accepting election results. As president, he routinely undermined the rule of law. And he eventually tried to illegally hold on to power after losing the 2020 election, going so far as to incite a deadly insurrection that ultimately failed. Now, his recklessness is putting the country\u2019s institutions through yet another dangerous stress test that has many critics worried about the long-term viability of American democracy and the risk of Trump successfully governing like a dictator. These are certainly valid concerns. Trump\u2019s first month in office has been a relentless assault on government: He is gutting the federal workforce, overtly handing over power to the world\u2019s richest man, and even trying to redefine American citizenship altogether. Joshua Keating Donald Trump had talked about firing senior military commanders on the campaign trail as far back as last summer. After the election, his transition team reportedly drew up a list of senior officers to be fired. Trump\u2019s secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, had told a podcast just days before he was named to his position, \u201cFirst of all, you\u2019ve got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\u201d Still, the Friday night massacre that befell senior US military leaders, came as a shock. Those fired include Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff James Slife, and the judge advocates general for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Hegseth\u2019s top military assistant, Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, was relieved on Saturday. Sean Collins Germany had a major election last weekend, one that left its center-left ruling party, the Social Democratic Party ruling party in the dust, and the conservative Christian Democratic Union ascendant once again. The country\u2019s likely next leader, Friedrich Merz, took to the airwaves after the results were announced and proclaimed that it was time for not just a new Germany, but for a new Europe. How much Europe should rely on the United States is an issue that has loomed over European politics since President Donald Trump took power just over a month ago, bringing his isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision with him. Andrew Prokop The latest stage in Elon Musk\u2019s effort to purge the civil service came on Saturday afternoon with an email to federal workers asking: \u201cWhat did you do last week?\u201d \u201cPlease reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,\u201d the message from the US Office of Personnel Management read. \u201cPlease do not send any classified information, links, or attachments. Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.\u201d Dylan Scott Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) underlings are powering his takeover of the government with a \u201chardcore\u201d work ethic that sacrifices sleeping for around-the-clock grinding. Musk boasted that they are working long hours, even over weekends because their \u201copponents\u201d take that time off. They moved sofa beds into the Office of Personnel Management and other government agencies. One seller of trendy \u201csleep pods\u201d generously sent their product to Musk and his team, hoping to help them catch some precious zzz\u2019s. Nicole Narea President Donald Trump is no stranger to conspiracy: He rose to political prominence by touting the racist lie that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. His team isn\u2019t either: Take Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s longtime baseless conviction that childhood vaccines cause autism or the billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s promotion of the 2016 \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory. The embrace of conspiracy theories isn\u2019t new, but now that Trump is back in power, there is a direct pipeline between online conspiracy theories and government policy \u2014 and in some cases, it\u2019s happening at breathtaking speed. Sean Collins\u00a0and\u00a0Umair Irfan Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go. Umair Irfan \u2014 a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox \u2014 has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. Eric Levitz Elon Musk might be the most powerful man in America. Donald Trump has put his patron in charge of the federal bureaucracy, allowing Musk to tailor the administrative state to his whims, which are far-reaching and almost certainly unconstitutional. The tech mogul has shuttered a government agency in defiance of Congress\u2019s will, orchestrated mass layoffs at myriad other bureaus, and threatened to cancel payments that he deems illegitimate. Ian Millhiser On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear its first employment discrimination case since President Donald Trump took power and began a fairly comprehensive assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in government and private employment. The case, known as Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, reads like it was generated for the very purpose of fueling opposition to DEI, and could be the end of a strange rule meant to discourage meritless discrimination lawsuits by groups not traditionally discriminated against. Kyndall Cunningham Kim Kardashian\u2019s career has been one big guessing game. Since founding the extremely successful shapewear company Skims in 2019, the reality-star-turned-lifestyle-influencer has embarked on a number of surprising if not totally puzzling ventures, from trying to become a lawyer to starring in a poorly rated season of American Horror Story to filming an eerie \u201cSanta Baby\u201d music video. Thanks to her recent Instagram activity, though, her followers have already started to suspect her next move. The theory is that Kardashian is making a rightward turn, cozying up to those currently in power as she continues to grow her economic empire and align herself with the world\u2019s most powerful business leaders. While not a foregone conclusion, it\u2019s all in the tea leaves. Let\u2019s back up. Benji Jones President Donald Trump says he wants the US to have the cleanest air and water on the planet \u2014 a desire, unsurprisingly, shared by all Americans. Those resources don\u2019t just appear. They come from nature. Freshwater mussels, clams, and aquatic vegetation, for example, filter rivers and streams and provide clean places to swim and habitat for fish to thrive. They also lower water treatment costs. On larger scales, forests and grasslands absorb air pollutants and regulate rain cycles, which helps clean the air.

        "title": "Pediatrician In Congress Blames RFK Jr. For Child's Death From Measles | HuffPost Latest News",
        "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON \u2014 Late Wednesday, Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.) tore into Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying a child\u2019s death in a measles outbreak in Texas, saying she blames Kennedy for the tragedy because of his long record of spreading disinformation about vaccines. State health officials confirmed Wednesday that an unvaccinated child in rural West Texas had died amid the outbreak, becoming the first U.S. death from measles since 2015. Measles is highly contagious but preventable with vaccines. Asked later in the same day about the unnamed child\u2019s death during the first Cabinet meeting of President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, Kennedy said only that measles outbreaks are \u201cnot unusual\u201d and that \u201cwe have measles outbreaks every year.\u201d Schrier, who is a pediatrician, said she was stunned by Kennedy\u2019s response. \u201cHe\u2019s full of, you can put four letters there,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cStarts with an \u2018S.\u2019\u201d The fact that a child has died from a vaccine-preventable disease is \u201cdevastating,\u201d Schrier said. \u201cAnd by the way, I do blame him and others like him who, for the past 20 years, have been spreading lies about vaccines, which are safe and effective. And that has been proven time and again. This is settled science.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As of Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services has reported 124 cases of measles since late January, the largest outbreak the state has seen in nearly 30 years. The vast majority of these cases are children, and all but five of these cases are in people who are unvaccinated or with an unknown vaccination status. Measles vaccines were first developed in the 1960s and then combined with vaccines for mumps and rubella in the 1970s. Measles was considered eradicated in the U.S. in 2000. But there have been outbreaks from time to time, and Schrier said it is because of people like Kennedy, who has a high profile and has denigrated vaccines dozens of times. He has repeatedly promoted the false claim that vaccines cause autism, something he did as recently as 2023 in a Fox News interview. In a podcast interview that same year, Kennedy said, \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective.\u201d In 2021, he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on when children should get vaccinated. During a 2019 measles epidemic in Samoa that left 80 children dead, Kennedy wrote to the country\u2019s prime minister, falsely claiming the measles vaccine was probably causing the deaths. \u201cPeople like him keep telling vulnerable parents that there\u2019s something wrong with vaccines,\u201d Schrier said. \u201cThey are preying on these parents, and that has a direct line to the death of this child.\u201d The Washington state congresswoman also took aim at senators who voted this month to confirm Kennedy to his powerful post atop HHS, despite knowing he spent decades rejecting science and pushing conspiracies about childhood vaccines causing autism. Kennedy was confirmed on a party-line vote, except for one Republican who voted no: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a childhood polio survivor. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is a physician and chairs the Senate\u2019s top health committee, briefly waffled on whether he would support Kennedy\u2019s nomination. He specifically raised concerns about Kennedy\u2019s record of spreading lies about vaccine safety. But in the end, he supported him. A Cassidy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about Kennedy downplaying the measles epidemic in Texas. \u201cEvery Republican senator who voted to confirm him as secretary of Health and Human Services knew that this was going to happen,\u201d Schrier said, referring to the child who died from measles. Scientists are already on edge about the possibility of Kennedy using his position to sow doubts about vaccines. On Wednesday, a panel of scientific experts that advises the Food and Drug Administration on vaccine policy learned that its upcoming meeting to discuss next year\u2019s flu vaccines had been canceled. No reason was given. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds is expected as soon as Thursday evening to sign the bill into law, which would roll back nearly two decades of civil rights protections for trans Iowans. Iowa Democrats warned that the bill would open the door for employers and educators to discriminate against trans people in the state. \u201cThis is a sad day for Iowa,\u201d state Sen. Zach Wahls said during the Senate debate. \u201c[This bill] will tell employers you have a green light to fire somebody because of who they are\u2026and that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d The votes in both chambers were met with outrage from hundreds of protestors who packed the Iowa Capitol rotunda, waving pride flags and sending messages of support to transgender Iowans. If Reynolds signs the bill, Iowa would be the first state to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity. In contrast, 22 other states explicitly bar discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. A spokesperson for Reynolds\u2019 office did not immediately respond to questions after the vote on whether she would sign the bill. But the Republican governor has signed anti-trans legislation in the past, including a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors and another barring transgender girls from participating in school sports. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected classes, which amended the state\u2019s civil rights law for the first time since 1965 and helped pave the way for broader workplace protections for trans Iowans. In 2019, Jesse Vroegh, a nurse with the Iowa Department of Corrections, won a lawsuit after he was denied the use of men\u2019s restrooms and insurance coverage because he is transgender. That same year, EerieAnna Good and Carol Beal, two transgender women, also won a suit against Iowa\u2019s Department of Human Services for denying them Medicaid coverage for their gender-affirming surgeries. In both instances, the courts found that denials of equal coverage violated gender identity protections in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act. Now, the Iowa bill throws the future of these protections into jeopardy. The bill, SF 418, defines sex based on a person\u2019s anatomy at birth and mirrors the language of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order declaring that there are \u201conly two sexes, male and female\u201d as well as other state-level legislation attempting to redefine sex in a way that erases legal recognition of transgender people. Since Trump signed his executive order in the first hours of his presidency, incarcerated transgender women housed in women\u2019s prison facilities have been moved to men\u2019s facilities and numerous transgender people have been denied the ability to change the sex marker on their passports and other federal documents. Advocates for LGBTQ rights, equity in schools and religious freedom in Iowa denounced the bill\u2019s passage, arguing that an attack on any protected class threatens the broader safety of all Iowans.

        "title": "Trump Reups Old Lie To Rewrite History Of Getting Russian Help To Win 2016 Election | HuffPost Latest News",
        "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON \u2015 Donald Trump renewed a major first-term lie Thursday in his continued defense of Vladimir Putin, falsely claiming that the Russian dictator did not help him win the presidency in 2016. \u201cWe had to go through the Russian hoax together. That was not a good thing. That was not fair. That was a rigged deal and had nothing to do with Russia,\u201d Trump told reporters at a White House photo opportunity with visiting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. \u201cThey had to put up with it,\u201d Trump said of Putin and his aides. \u201cWith a phony story that was made up.\u201d In fact, both special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and the Senate Intelligence Committee found that Putin made extensive efforts to help Trump win in 2016, most notably by having his spies steal emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides and then release them during the final month of the campaign through Russian ally WikiLeaks. What\u2019s more, Trump was informed by the FBI in August of that year that the emails had been stolen by Russia \u2014 just weeks after Trump had publicly asked Russia to obtain them. Despite knowing of their provenance, Trump enthusiastically cited the stolen material in campaign rallies and interviews every single day, starting on Oct. 10, 2016, through Election Day. HuffPost repeatedly asked Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and first-term White House staff why Trump had knowingly accepted Putin\u2019s help to win and received no answer until 2018, when Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani responded that Trump took the assistance because he could. \u201cIt isn\u2019t illegal... It was sort of like a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not involved in the illegality of getting it.\u201d In 2017, Trump began calling the accurate description of Russia\u2019s work to elect him a \u201choax\u201d and eventually sent Giuliani to Ukraine to dig up evidence to support a conspiracy theory being pitched by Russian intelligence that it was actually Ukraine that had tried to help Clinton. Giuliani\u2019s eagerness to accept information being fed to him by Putin\u2019s spies eventually led to Trump attempting to extort then-newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into announcing an investigation into the Democrat he feared most in 2020, Joe Biden. Trump was impeached for that action, but the Republican-led Senate declined to remove him from office. Trump\u2019s animosity toward Zelenskyy appears to have endured in the years since. When Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump called it \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201csavvy.\u201d He very quickly began complaining that the United States under Biden was sending too much aid to Ukraine, and then began lying about the total the U.S. sent and how it compared to what Western European countries were sending.

In recent weeks, Trump has on multiple occasions called the democratically elected Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d but has pointedly refused to say the same of Putin, who has not held free elections in decades and has had his opponents and critics murdered. During Thursday\u2019s Oval Office session, Trump bizarrely claimed he had never used that word to describe Zelenskyy. \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Next question,\u201d he said. It was unclear whether Trump forgot about his Feb. 19 social media post and the subsequent speech in which he used that word or whether he was joking. His White House aides did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s queries on the matter.

        "title": "How to Turn an \u201cEconomic Blackout\u201d Into an All-Out War on Corporate Power",
        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Friday\u2019s economic boycott is a one-day attack on corporate interests. The degrowth movement calls for a broader societal shift. Americans who couldn\u2019t defeat President Donald Trump in the voting booth are planning on Friday to fight back \u2014 with their pocketbooks. The People\u2019s Union USA, a movement led by a former drum instructor John Schwarz, organized a 24-hour \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d that calls on American consumers to make no purchases, especially from major retail, gas, or fast food companies. If people need to buy essentials, they are urged to shop at local, small businesses. Schwarz said the boycott is meant to send a message to \u201cthe elite\u201d that everyday people hold the economic power and to \u201cexpose\u201d the corruption of corporations, industries, and politicians. Future weeklong boycotts targeting Amazon, Nestl\u00e9, Target, and Walmart are planned from March until July. \u201cCorporations profit off of our labor while keeping wages low, banks steal billions through inflation and predatory policies, politicians accept bribes disguised as donations while ignoring the people,\u201d Schwarz said in a viral video posted on Instagram. \u201cThey have taken everything from us while convincing us we should be grateful of the scraps. And that ends now.\u201d Consumer-led boycotts aren\u2019t a new phenomena. In fact, they span decades and have grown alongside an increasingly popular theory and social movement similarly aiming to wrest control away from corporations and put it in the hands of the people. Rooted in the work of American and European political theorists of the 1970s, the \u201cdegrowth\u201d movement criticizes a capitalist system that seeks unending growth and profit, which has led to ecological and environmental ruin such as the impacts of climate change. Instead, it advocates for a system that prioritizes the needs of the planet and its people, such as housing, education, and health care. According to Jason Hickel, a leading advocate of degrowth and author of \u201cLess is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World,\u201d the movement calls for reducing consumption and production of things that harm the planet such fossil fuels, SUVs, private jets, mansions, fast fashion, industrial beef, cruise ships, and the military\u2013industrial complex. While the term may be unfamiliar to many Americans, its core ideas have cropped up in the Green New Deal\u2019s goals of a post-fossil fuel economy; the pandemic-era phenomenon of white-collar workers voluntarily quitting their jobs and working less; and the recent social media trend of \u201cno buy,\u201d which encouraged people to purchase less and repurpose more. \u201cPeople are getting a sense that they\u2019re ripped off, that they\u2019re being taken advantage of and exploited as consumers,\u201d said Aaron Vansintjan, co-author of \u201cThe Future Is Degrowth: A Guide to a World Beyond Capitalism.\u201d \u201cIt is promising that people are responding to the current moment by showing their distrust of these corporations.\u201d The boycott has drawn wide\u2013ranging media coverage, along with the attention of some celebrities. It also caught the attention of Linda Sarsour, a progressive activist best known for organizing the 2017 Women\u2019s March after Trump\u2019s first election. \u201cIt is an easy risk-free way to invite masses of people to act in reaction to the outrageousness of this Administration,\u201d Sarsour told The Intercept in an email. She said her group, Until Freedom, is also backing the Black-led boycott of Target, which rolled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in lockstep with the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on DEI in the federal government. A separate pro-DEI boycott by Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network is being planned after committing to \u201cdo the Dr. King-Rosa Parks on\u201d companies that have eliminated diversity efforts. Along with executive actions targeting diversity efforts, the Trump administration has spent its first weeks cozying up to corporate interests. House Republicans on Wednesday narrowly passed a budget, which calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and increases in military and border security spending. Such a plan would benefit ultra-rich corporate owners and will likely lead to cuts in social programs such as Medicaid. Last week, billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency called for the laying off Social Security Administration workers, which may limit the access of vulnerable Americans to Social Security payments. Musk previously attacked the program, falsely alleging that tens of millions of dead people are still getting government benefits. The Trump administration has also halted work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog governmental agency that defends consumers from predatory companies and banks. This week, the bureau dropped its lawsuits against major companies, such as Capitol One, which allegedly cheated millions of customers out of $8 billion in interest payments. Schwarz, who did not respond to The Intercept\u2019s request for comment, does not mention the Trump administration or specific policies in his messaging, and instead takes aim at\u00a0\u201cpoliticians \u2018both left and right\u2019\u201d who have \u201cpassed laws that serve billionaires.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear what movements and ideas Schwarz is drawing from for the February 28 boycott, Hickel sees overlap between Friday\u2019s economic blackout and the broader degrowth movement. \u201cDegrowth calls for greater democratic control over production, and calls for production to be organized around human well-being and social progress rather than around profit maximization,\u201d Hickel, who teaches at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology in Spain, told The Intercept. \u201cGoing after companies like Amazon and Nestl\u00e9 and others, which are characterized by corporate greed and mistreatment of workers, is certainly in line with that,\u201d he said. \u201cDegrowth is also strongly anti-colonial, and many of the targeted companies, such as Nestl\u00e9, benefit from brutal exploitation of people in the global South.\u201d  Original reporting.

He also pointed to the campaign\u2019s encouragement of spending toward local businesses, which further aligns with degrowth, since such small businesses \u201ctend to be more democratic and more ethically oriented.\u201d For Matthias Schmelzer, another leading expert in degrowth and co-author with Vansintjan on \u201cThe Future Is Degrowth,\u201d the boycotts recall\u00a0other recent consumer-led movements: While such actions put public and political pressure on companies, there is a ceiling to consumer-led boycotts, Schmelzer cautioned. \u201cAs consumers, we have only a very limited amount of power,\u201d Schmelzer said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m very skeptical about the effectiveness of these boycott actions to actually shift markets.\u201d Vansintjan is also skeptical about the long-term impact of the February 28 boycott, especially without the backing of organized labor. A resident of Montreal, Vansintjan pointed to a consumer-led boycott last year of Canadian grocery chain Loblaw over rising prices of goods. Despite the boycott, which was organized primarily through Reddit and was widely popular among Canadians, the chain reported increased profits. There was an eventual dip to their earnings, but that was likely due to a lawsuit over price-gouging. Even so, Vansintjan was encouraged by the excitement around the February 28 boycott. He hopes it will translate into further action aiming to impact not just corporate sales, but also corporate shareholders, who are typically unaffected by single-day dips in revenue.He mentioned a nationwide boycott in Canada against Amazon, which closed all of its Quebec warehouses after workers there recently formed a union. Labor unions are leading the boycott, but local governments have also joined the action with the city of Montreal ceasing to buy from Amazon and pledging to instead buy local. Though the power of consumers may be limited, Vansintjan said, the power of workers and tenants is more vast. Employees can call on their employers to divest their pension funds from target companies. Tenant organizing can oppose landlords on rent increases or evictions, which would be felt by large companies that tend to invest their profits in real estate. Such movements can not only hurt the value of a company\u2019s assets, but can also affect its perceived value in the eyes of shareholders. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have an impact where you shop, because most of us don\u2019t actually have much of a choice in that,\u201d he said, acknowledging the monopolies some companies have on essential goods. But \u201cas a worker or as a tenant, you actually can have an impact because you live somewhere, you work somewhere \u2014 it\u2019s a place where you are able to resist your own exploitation.\u201d WAIT!

        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Lobbying to return Andrew Tate to the U.S. reveals the hollowness of the Republican Party\u2019s anti-sex trafficking campaign. The Republican Party is obsessed with sex trafficking, grooming, and pedophilia. For years, the GOP has built its brand on a bizarre, often conspiratorial fixation with sex trafficking, invoking this trafficking panic to justify border militarization and its assault on LGBTQ+ adults and children. And yet, when an actual accused rapist and alleged human trafficker comes along, Republicans rush to his defense \u2014 and lobby to bring him back to the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has successfully lobbied to bring Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan back to the U.S. from Romania, where Tate faces charges of human trafficking, sexual misconduct, and money laundering. American officials first brought up Tate\u2019s case in a call with the Romanian government last week. At an international conference, Trump\u2019s special envoy Richard Grenell pressed Romanian authorities to lift travel restrictions on the self-described misogynist influencer, the Financial Times reported. Tate, a former professional kickboxer and avid Trump supporter, has used his massive social media following to spread his reactionary politics and violent hatred of women, influencing a generation of boys and young men by preying on their insecurities and promising quick riches through affiliate marketing schemes. Prosecutors in Romania allege that Tate and his brother set up a criminal enterprise and used it to sexually exploit multiple people. Despite these serious allegations, Republican figures and influencers have repeatedly defended Tate. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who has been investigated for sex trafficking himself, previously offered support to Tate, saying that the charges always seemed \u201csuspect.\u201d Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson traveled to Romania for a softball interview with Tate, allowing the influencer to portray himself as a family man who is merely a victim of \u201cthe matrix\u201d and the mainstream media. Allegations of sexual harassment and assault are no longer a line that can\u2019t be crossed in conservative politics. Trump himself has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault and harassment, found liable by a jury of sexual abuse, and notoriously had a close friendship with the serial sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Despite a sex trafficking probe that closed without charges, Gaetz took the stage for a speech at the Republican National Convention.  Original reporting. Fearless journalism.

And when former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert pleaded guilty to trying to pay off men he had sexually abused as a high school wrestling coach, prominent Republicans, including three former congressmen, supported him enough to write letters in defense of his character to a federal judge. (To be clear, the Democratic Party is also guilty of downplaying or defending abusers within its own ranks; this is not a partisan problem.) But the GOP\u2019s embrace of Tate, and other sex criminals on the right, reveals the hollowness of the Republican Party\u2019s anti-trafficking campaign. Trafficking is not a real issue for Republican lawmakers \u2014 it\u2019s a rhetorical weapon used to advance draconian crackdowns, delegitimize political opponents, and launch broader attacks on progressive and feminist movements. If they were serious about fighting trafficking, then they would focus instead on labor protections and expanding social safety net services for the most vulnerable populations. Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sought to distance himself from the Tate brothers, saying that Florida is not a place where they\u2019re welcome. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it came to this,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe were not involved, we were not notified. I found out through the media.\u201d As Republican politicians continue their fixation on the supposed trafficking epidemic, demanding border crackdowns and pretending to be champions for exploited children, remember where their loyalties lie. They will lobby for Andrew Tate before they ever lift a finger for an actual victim. For the Trump administration, trafficking is not a crisis to solve. It\u2019s a crisis to exploit. WAIT!

        "title": "Crypto Gears Up for New Jersey, New York Governor Election",
        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED An industry increasingly associated with Trumpism is moving into the spotlight in Democratic gubernatorial races in New Jersey and New York. Mayor Steve Fulop of Jersey City, New Jersey, was running for governor when he announced that he would invest part of his city\u2019s pension fund in bitcoin. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., was toying with a challenge to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul when he co-sponsored a resolution calling blockchain technology \u201cthe future of innovation.\u201d Between them, the two represented an emerging trend among ambitious Democrats: Candidates angling for state office are touting support for the cryptocurrency industry. For crypto, the trend could yield rewards. Industry players would like to see friendly state-level financial regulation, loose rules for energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining, and potentially even state pension fund investments in their products. One industry critic chalked up the trend of Democrats paying homage to crypto to the industry\u2019s money cannon. \u201cI think it boils down to two words: opportunism and fear,\u201d said Mark Hays, who works for the groups advocacy groups Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. \u201cI don\u2019t think it gets more nuanced than that.\u201d For politicians, the push for crypto could draw votes from the young men mostly likely to trade crypto, but there could be bigger rewards to be reaped by attracting deep-pocketed industry donors. Supporters of crypto threw around large sums of money in last year\u2019s elections for national offices and won nearly across the board. \u201cThe crypto industry, because the industry can print its own money, somewhat literally and metaphorically, it is able to pull a lot of money into electoral races and lobbying activity,\u201d Hays said. \u201cRight now, a lot of folks are worried about being on the wrong side of that money.\u201d The move, though, could also invite backlash from Democratic primary voters at a time when the Dogecoin brand has been coopted by Elon Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn government office and President Donald Trump has launched a meme coin of his own. Cryptocurrency companies have taken an improbable journey over the past decade from Silicon Valley startups to Washington power players. They first flexed their might in 2022, when Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives at the fraudulent crypto platform FTX showered tens of millions of dollars on Democratic and Republican campaigns. Bankman-Fried was behind bars by 2024, but other industry figures banded together on a super PAC that spent nearly $200 million on congressional races. The group was officially bipartisan and spent millions on Democrats, but it leaned Republican. The spending allocation may have ended up helping tip control of the Senate to Republicans and alienated one Democratic megadonor, who quit the effort in protest and eventually received a refund for his contribution. Last year, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the crypto\u2019s top legislative priority, a bill called Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century, or\u00a0FIT 21, that would slide most cryptocurrencies under an industry-friendly regulatory agency called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Many Democrats were in favor of the bill \u2014 including two running in the crowded primary for the New Jersey governor\u2019s race. Both of them, Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, have been rated by the trade group Stand With Crypto as \u201cstrongly\u201d supporting the industry. Neither Sherrill nor Gottheimer has talked up crypto on the campaign trail, and the issue has largely flown under the radar, according to an observer of state politics. \u201cTo most of the public, they haven\u2019t encountered it in the gubernatorial race,\u201d said Kristoffer Shields, the director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University. Shields still believes there are voters who care intensely about the issue, given the many finance industry professionals who work in New York City and Philadelphia but live in New Jersey. Fulop, the Jersey City mayor and a former Goldman Sachs banker, may have had those voters in mind when he announced in July that he would be investing part of Jersey City\u2019s pension fund in bitcoin. Fulop said on X\u00a0that he had \u201cbeen a long time believer (through ups/downs) in crypto\u201d and that blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, \u201cis amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet.\u201d In a statement, Fulop said the city has allocated only a small percentage of its pension holdings to bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund and that it has performed well since the purchases began in November. State pension funds represent an attractive opportunity for crypto companies, who have begun lobbying states to invest in their products. If elected to the governor\u2019s mansion, Fulop said he would be open to investing some of the state\u2019s pension money in cryptocurrencies. \u201cSimilar to what we\u2019ve done with Jersey City\u2019s pension fund, I believe in asset class diversification as a responsible investment strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cAllocating 1 to 2 percent of a portfolio to crypto can provide reasonable exposure while managing risk appropriately.\u201d From a political perspective, Shields said, investing in crypto could worry voters about losing money on risky bets. He believes, however, that associating with crypto also provides politicians to grab on to a rare issue that cuts across party lines. \u201cMost constituents haven\u2019t thought too much about it or don\u2019t care about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ones who do care care a lot.\u201d So far, the industry has not directed its vast campaign holdings into the New Jersey gubernatorial race. At least three of the Democrats have received campaign donations from crypto companies or leaders, however. Crypto-aligned super PACs spent $242,000 backing Gottheimer during the last election cycle and crypto figures donated $51,000 directly to his campaign organizations, according to the tracker website Follow the Crypto. Money donated to his federal campaign account cannot be transferred to his state account. Industry figures have given far less \u2014 $3,333 \u2014 to Sherrill, who is leading in the polls so far. A super PAC supporting Fulop, meanwhile, received a $10,000 donation from Gregory Tusar, a vice president at the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. \u201cGreg and I have been personal friends for 20 years,\u201d Fulop said in a statement. \u201cWe worked together in algorithmic trading at Goldman Sachs long before cryptocurrency even existed. His support of Coalition for Progress has nothing to do with the crypto industry.\u201d Across the Hudson River, the contours of the 2026 New York governor\u2019s race are already taking shape. Sitting Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s weak poll numbers have encouraged other Democrats to consider a primary challenge. Hochul in 2022 earned the enmity of the crypto industry by signing a two-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining, which was motivated by concerns from environmentalists that it would incentivize the reopening of dirty power plants. So far, two rumored Democratic contenders to Hochul have strong connections to crypto. Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado was backed by a $1 million donation from an SBF-associated super PAC during his 2022 campaign, which drew accusations that he was supported by \u201cdirty\u201d money even before the collapse of FTX. Delgado\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Torres, the New York representative in Washington, has repeatedly touted the benefits of crypto from his perch in Congress. He lambasted regulators under former President Joe Biden for trying to crack down on companies such as Ripple Labs and Coinbase for violating securities laws. Both companies contributed to a network of super PACs that backed Torres with $173,000 in spending during the last election cycle. (Torres did not respond to a request for comment.) During his time in Congress, he has sponsored at least eight pro-crypto measures, the most recent a resolution expressing general support for digital assets and blockchain technology. \u201cBlockchain technology and digital assets represent the future of innovation, economic growth, and financial inclusion,\u201d Torres said in a February 5 statement accompanying the measure\u2019s introduction. \u201cThe United States must lead in shaping a regulatory framework that fosters technological advancement while protecting consumers and ensuring transparency. By embracing this next generation, we can create a more equitable financial system that benefits every American.\u201d  Original reporting. Fearless journalism.

Torres, one of two Democrats to co-sponsor the crypto resolution, was embracing crypto at a moment when crypto was embracing Trump. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was one of the first executives to meet with Trump after his election in November. Last week, the company announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission would drop a 2023 lawsuit against it. One of the biggest launches in the crypto world in recent months was by Trump himself, with the introduction hours before his inauguration of the $TRUMP token. The Trump coin sparked a backlash in the crypto world from figures who worried it would harm the industry\u2019s reputation. Hays, the advocate with Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, said candidates should be cautious when embracing the industry, because they may wind up embracing a worldview that alienates their voters. \u201cMany, many people are concerned about what Elon Musk is doing. There is not much daylight at all between Elon Musk\u2019s worldview, his goals and objectives, his ideas about how society should effectively be run by techno elites, and key leading figures of the crypto industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people see crypto as not only a representation of that worldview, but a means to an end.\u201d WAIT!

        "title": "How to Leak Under the Trump Administration",
        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Want to expose wrongdoing in the U.S. government? Take these steps to keep yourself safe. President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have fond feelings for whistleblowers. During his first term, Trump\u2019s Justice Department carried out a clandestine spying operation to try to catch leakers. On the campaign trail, Trump on multiple occasions threatened to arrest journalists who don\u2019t reveal their sources \u2014 and suggested they should be raped in prison until they give up names. For those who want to speak out against wrongdoing within the U.S. government, it has never been more critical to take steps to keep themselves safe. So we compiled these best practices for leaking information in public interest under the Trump administration. Phone calls and text messages are convenient, but they aren\u2019t safe for whistleblowers. As outlined in a December report from the Office of the Inspector General, the Justice Department in Trump\u2019s first term repeatedly utilized \u201ccompulsory processes\u201d \u2014 which include subpoenas, search warrants, and court orders \u2014 to request \u201cnon-content communications records\u201d from phone carriers serving journalists at CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. The requests were for both the reporters\u2019 work numbers and their personal numbers. Non-content records don\u2019t include the communications themselves \u2014 such as copies of text messages or voicemails. Instead, government investigators were keen to gather metadata pertaining to the communications: for instance, who sent a message or made a call to a journalist\u2019s phone and at what time. Even if the contents of the conversation are not recorded, the metadata establishes clear links between parties. If a metadata search turns up evidence of communication with journalists or rights groups, this alone could reveal who is behind a leak. Never use a work or personal email address when communicating with journalists. In its attempt to root out leaks during Trump\u2019s first term, the Justice Department also sought non-content information pertaining to reporters\u2019 email communications from their email service providers. They wanted details such as the time an email was sent and received, as well as the sender\u2019s email address. While email encryption technology can encrypt the body of the email message and in some cases subject lines as well, the email addresses themselves and dates and times emails are sent and received are not encrypted. This means it\u2019s not hard for investigators to use email records to draw a clear line between a journalist and their source \u2014 even if they can\u2019t determine what information specifically was exchanged. Setting up a separate email account entirely for communicating with journalists or rights groups is an option, but there are a number of potential gotchas. For instance, care should be taken to not reveal any identifying information when setting up a burner email account: Don\u2019t use your phone number for two-factor authentication, choose a throwaway username that is not linked to you in any way, and select a vetted VPN or the Tor network to mask your IP address. Considering all these obstacles, it\u2019s often best to avoid email altogether. The owners of tech\u2019s biggest social media platforms have shown varying degrees of fealty to the Trump administration. These genuflections include Mark Zuckerberg ending DEI programs at Meta, Andy Yen, the CEO of \u201cprivacy-first\u201d email provider Proton, going on about how the Republican party today stands for \u201cthe little guys,\u201d and Elon Musk, the owner of X, calling shots as a \u201cspecial government employee.\u201d The fact that Trump\u2019s richest fan also owns a popular social media platform should give pause about using X to share sensitive information. It doesn\u2019t take an overactive imagination to see a scenario in which the companies that own communication channels are willing to provide user information to a government they\u2019re eager to please.  Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.          \n\n            Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Although social media direct messages are generally unencrypted by default, some social media platforms now offer optional end-to-end encrypted messaging, though this feature needs to be enabled manually. For instance, X direct messages can be encrypted if both parties are verified users, and Facebook Messenger can also be used to send encrypted DMs. But the metadata, or non-content information, would still reveal that your account was in contact with a reporter\u2019s account. Similar metadata risks apply to messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp. Telegram offers encryption, but it is not enabled by default and comes with a number of limitations. WhatsApp encrypts messages by default, but nonetheless reveals a variety of metadata about communications themselves. Given the way government investigators typically demand non-content communication records, end-to-end encryption alone does not mask whether or not someone is talking to journalists or other entities. Secure communication tools such as Signal and Session minimize the amount of metadata and user information that platform operators themselves can access. Signal can identify the date a particular account was created, as well as when the account last accessed the service. It can also identify a phone number associated with an active username, which is vastly less metadata than other messaging platforms collect. If you\u2019re concerned about your username being linked to your phone number, change your username at regular intervals, which would prevent past usernames from being tied to your phone number. Signal routinely posts copies of the requests for user information it receives from the government. These disclosures show that Signal tends to share merely when a particular account was last accessed and first created. Government requests for information from service providers, however, may come with non-disclosure orders that could legally prevent operators from posting notice of these demands on their transparency pages and potentially bar them from notifying the affected users themselves. Session, a messenger whose tagline is \u201csend messages, not metadata\u201d reduces the amount of information it stores about its users by, for instance, not using centralized servers to relay messages. But the best end-to-end encryption and metadata minimization won\u2019t keep you safe without basic operational security. Digital access logs may reveal who viewed, printed, or downloaded a copy of the file, and when. The more files you access, the more likely it is that you may be the one common individual who accessed all those files. Avoid whistleblower communications while physically present at work. Aside from someone seeing your screen, your employer may also be able to identify that you accessed a particular communication service while on a company network. Under no circumstances should you also use work devices when communicating with or transferring data to reporters or rights groups. Equally risky are personal devices with any work-assigned device management apps installed. It might seem old-fashioned, but rather than taking a screenshot of a specific document or chat record on a work device, take a photo of the screen with a separate one-time use phone, or at least a personal device. Make clear to anyone you might alert of wrongdoing that leaked photos or documents generally should not be published in their entirety. That\u2019s because source material can potentially be linked to the specific device with which it was captured. A photo showing a file on your computer monitor, for instance, might include a blemish or a smudge of dirt on the screen. More sophisticated forensic techniques, such as watermarking, can be used to trace the origins of a leaked email or video conference. Even emails seemingly sent to a large number of recipients may be individually watermarked, with each message containing some unique change that can be traced to a single recipient. That\u2019s why it\u2019s safest for journalists not to reproduce emails verbatim and instead rely on selective quotes or summarizations. After communicating with outside parties, ensure that no records of sensitive communications persist. Be sure to delete not just specific messages, but entire chat histories from all linked devices on which your messaging app of choice is installed. Request that anyone with whom you share sensitive information does the same. Remember to not save each other in your contacts lists, either. Blowing the whistle can have a real impact in the world, but it also comes with risks \u2014 the threat of prosecution or losing your job among them. Although leak investigations may again become a priority in the Trump administration, these dos and don\u2019ts can help reduce the chances of exposing yourself when you\u2019re shining light on wrongdoing.

        "title": "Grow a Spine: Democrats Have a Lot to Learn From the German Left",
        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The German elections show we don\u2019t need to moderate fascism, we need to oppose it. Germany\u2019s election results may at first seem like just another success for conservative and far-right forces. The Christian Democrats won the most votes of any party with 28.52 percent. Their leader, Friedrich Merz, who has pushed the party significantly rightward during his tenure, will likely be the next chancellor. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD \u2013 Elon Musk\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u2013 came second, winning just over 20 percent, or around one in five votes. The AfD will remain outside of any ruling coalition in the parliament, thanks only to an enduring postwar commitment from Germany\u2019s other major parties to never form a coalition with an explicitly far-right entity. The centrist Social Democratic Party earned record low results, with 16 percent, and fellow centrists in the Green Party lost a significant number of votes. Democrats in the U.S. would do well to learn from their mistakes, and instead take notes from Germany\u2019s left-wing party, Die Linke, or The Left \u2014 the only party to dramatically exceed expectations on Sunday. Based on the vote counts alone, this could seem counterintuitive: Die Linke only won 9 percent. As recently as a month ago, however, it seemed feasible that the party could fail to garner the 5 percent of votes necessary to earn seats in Germany\u2019s parliament at all. The party outperformed, especially with young women voters; it won 27 percent of all first-time voters and gained 30,000 new members in the last month of the election campaign. Their surprise comeback offers a lesson in what is required to build \u2014 or at least begin to build \u2014 party political resistance to the far-right. Die Linke\u2019s relative successes, and the accumulating failures of the Greens and the Social Democrats, are further grounds to reject the centrist liberal insistence on bending to the right to keep the far-right at bay. The centrist strategy, aside from being morally turpitudinous, has been a losing one; it only serves to legitimize far-right frameworks and bolster right-wing parties. Die Linke, meanwhile, gained significant ground with an unambiguously leftist economic platform, which also \u2014 and this is crucial \u2014 refused to throw minorities under the bus. They focused on so-called \u201cbread and butter\u201d issues like rent and the rising cost of living, transport, and pensions, and defended trans and immigrant rights. They ran as the only party to robustly oppose far-right politics with strong words and policies. The election results undermine claims that the left must embrace \u201canti-woke\u201d positions if we are to challenge the racist far-right. One German party specifically deployed this strategy and failed to win enough votes to enter parliament. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, or BSW, named after its famous leader, formed as a split from Die Linke early last year and pushed a program of economic redistribution and worker protections, alongside anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ stances \u2014 a nationalist social democracy, willing to treat many thousands of people as disposable, while pushing to segment the international working class with protectionist nation-state borders. Wagenknecht was not rewarded. Meanwhile, her former party\u2019s clarity on class struggle as a clear priority, but intractable from race and gender struggles, appealed far more. Hundreds of thousands of German voters disturbed by the rise of the far-right sought an anti-fascist alternative. This was particularly true after the Christian Democrats\u2019 Merz caused public outcry in January when he pushed through a harsh anti-immigrant proposal in parliament by relying on votes from the AfD. The move was seen as a breach of the \u201cfirewall\u201d prohibiting collaboration with far-right parties, upheld since 1945. The Christian Democrats may have won the most votes on Sunday, but it was nonetheless the party\u2019s second lowest result in its history. Most other major parties condemned Merz, but it was only Die Linke that had any real ground to stand on. The Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats under current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and even Green Party leaders, have all to varying degrees spent the last decade-plus weakening the so-called firewall with their own support for harsh immigration restrictions. The German center\u2019s commitment to supporting Israel and its genocide, while violently criminalizing support for Palestine at home, is matched only by the U.S. Die Linke has also not been strong enough across the board when it comes to condemning Israel\u2019s war crimes and Germany\u2019s complicity in them, but it is also one of the only parties openly opposed to sending weapons to Israel. (The only other party was Wagenknecht\u2019s, with its attempt to pair anti-imperialist foreign policy with domestic xenophobia and racism.) Die Linke candidates like Ferat Ko\u00e7ak, an outspoken advocate for Palestinian freedom, modeled what a thoroughgoing anti-fascist, anti-racist, pro-working class platform can look like \u2013 putting economic issues front and center, but refusing to pander to a notion of the working class that prioritizes white men. Ko\u00e7ak will be the first member Die Linke to ever win a seat in West Germany. \u201cI knocked on doors and when people said they voted AfD, I said \u2018Okay, but if you want, you can still come to my office and I\u2019ll check if your heating bill is too high.\u2019\u201d On Monday, the New York Times credited Die Linke\u2019s savvy social media campaigning for its surge in support \u2013 which was by far the strongest with young, urban, and particularly women voters. And there\u2019s no doubt that the party\u2019s TikTok and Instagram game is strong. One of Die Linke\u2019s leaders, 36-year-old Heidi Reichinnek, has over a million viewers across the platforms, where she posts well-edited, accessible, educational content to push the party\u2019s core message. Jan van Aken, another co-leader, clearly expressed Die Linke\u2019s message on mainstream talk shows and the like. Social and traditional media efforts were no more vital, though, than a mass door-knocking strategy, in which Die Linke candidates and organizers made a point to ask would-be voters about their challenges and struggles. \u201cI knocked on doors and when people said they voted AfD, I said \u2018Okay, but if you want, you can still come to my office and I\u2019ll check if your heating bill is too high,\u2019\u201d Ines Schwerdtner, another of the party co-leaders, said in a press conference on Monday.

There are, of course, limits to mapping Germany\u2019s multiparty liberal capitalist democracy onto the U.S.\u2019s two-party leviathan. Certain similarities and patterns are, however, too strong to ignore. As is true with establishment Democrats, the German parties that span the liberal-to-conservative center have all lurched rightward on anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy in the last decade, while attempting the impossible balancing act of serving capitalist interests and claiming to stand for the working class. Redistributive economic reforms and state investment in social welfare have been insufficient. Ideological commitments to austerity pervade, bolstering the right-wing, anti-immigrant myth that there is too little to go around. Concerns about fascism from the lips of figures like Merz can ring hollow when AfD leaders have accused \u2014\u00a0with good reason \u2013 the Christian Democrats of copying their far-right anti-immigration program. Likewise, former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris warned of the fascistic threat of Trump, but were complicit in genocide, the criminalization of left-wing and pro-Palestine protest, and racist fearmongering over immigration and crime. These liberal capitalists have failed to offer a bulwark to the right, let alone an alternative. Die Linke\u2019s example is not a clear road map to anti-fascist victory; the AfD earned twice as many votes and further cemented gains in its strongholds in Germany\u2019s east. The mistake, though, would be to treat the German election as a story of political polarization, in need of centrist correction. There has been a repudiation of the liberal center: The Green Party, a green capitalist liberal party that has drifted far from its leftist roots, lost 700,000 voters to Die Linke compared to the 2021 elections; the Social Democrats, who will likely form the governing coalition with Merz\u2019s party, lost 560,000 votes to Die Linke. The neoliberal austerity paradigms that helped foster 21st century fascist movements will not be the answer. Die Linke\u2019s proposal is a simple one: We don\u2019t need to moderate fascism, we need to oppose it. Correction: February 26, 2025This story has been updated to reflect that, while its numbers were down, the Green Party did not score a record-low vote. WAIT!

        "text": "\u00a9 THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Trump\u2019s crusade against \u201cwokeness\u201d is co-opting the language of the civil rights movement to undo its legacy. After leaving the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol earlier this month, President Donald Trump and his entourage slipped into the imposing ballroom at the Washington Hilton, where the real show was about to begin. At the \u201cunofficial\u201d event on February 6, organized by the powerful and insular evangelical group known as \u201cthe Family,\u201d Trump took a victory lap before the crowd of largely white evangelicals. These were the voters who had thrust him into power, and they were eager to celebrate the rash of executive orders reversing decades-old civil rights advances. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been watching but we got rid of woke over the last two weeks. Woke is gone-zo,\u201d Trump said, to applause. \u201cWe\u2019re a merit-based society now.\u201d With an assist from Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Trump has made the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion a centerpiece of his new administration. \u00a0For all the crowing about his early success \u2014 much of it greatly overinflated \u2014 Trump has simply flipped the script: Instead of creating a level playing field, he launched DEI for white Christians. Trump\u2019s bid to dismantle the legacy of the civil rights movement while using its own language is part and parcel of the Christian right\u2019s playbook, according to Christine Reyna, a psychology professor at DePaul University who studies extremism. \u201cThey\u2019ve stumbled on a winning strategy, which is to portray white people as victims and portray their movement as a civil rights movement,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve completely co-opted the strategies of the Black civil rights movement.\u201d At the prayer event that morning, Trump announced the latest gift to his right-wing evangelical supporters: a task force on \u201canti-Christian bias,\u201d helmed by his new Attorney General Pam Bondi. \u201c[T]he task force will work to fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s war on \u201cwoke\u201d is a realization of decades of political organizing that has always had civil rights in its crosshairs. Despite rhetoric about religious liberty, backsliding on civil rights and the far-right push to usher in a Christian theocracy are inextricably linked \u2014 and they always have been, according to Brad Onishi, a professor of religion at the University of San Francisco. \u201cThere has been a war on the representation of rights of people they think don\u2019t deserve them or at least don\u2019t deserve to be at an equal seat of the American roundtable,\u201d said Onishi, himself a former evangelical Christian. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s 60 years in the making.\u201d While discussions of the Christian right often focus on the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision as its origin story, the issue that truly launched the movement was integration. In 1976, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist college that banned interracial marriage on \u201creligious grounds\u201d and, until 1971, excluded Black applicants entirely. The case, which eventually made its way to the Supreme Court along with similar efforts to desegregate religious institutions catalyzed white Christian outrage. Groups like the Moral Majority sprung up in defense of segregation, capitalizing on white evangelicals\u2019 feelings of grievance. Although later Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. would argue that Roe had been his breaking point, scholars have noted that the emergence of these efforts, including Falwell\u2019s, began before Roe and only incorporated anti-abortion stances into their platforms in the late 1970s. Like Trump, these organizations combined a promise of the restoration of Christianity to dominance in American political life with a staunch opposition to integration and other socially liberal trends in American life. \u201cThe great white Christian flight from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party occurred primarily because the Democratic Party became the party defending the civil rights of Black Americans in this country,\u201d said Robert\u00a0 P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of \u201cThe Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and the Path to a Shared American Future.\u201d Now, said Jones, \u201cthe two political parties have essentially sorted themselves along ethno-religious lines.\u201d  Original reporting.

Over the last month, Trump has moved swiftly to turn white evangelicals\u2019 grievances into policy. In a series of executive orders, the president undid decades worth of civil rights protections for marginalized communities, brick by brick. He froze the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, eliminated all DEI roles in the federal government, and dismantled equal opportunity executive orders barring racial discrimination in employment. On the flip side, he formed the \u201canti-Christian bias\u201d task force \u2014 announced with fanfare at \u201cthe Family\u2019s\u201d prayer breakfast \u2014 and re-instituted the White House Faith Office, a bureau led by televangelist Paula White that consults religious leaders on policy. Reyna, the DePaul professor, said that there\u2019s a legal benefit to couching the far right\u2019s movement in the terms of civil rights. \u201cWhat\u2019s especially powerful about this tactic is that civil rights laws already exist. They already are fundamental to our legal system,\u201d said Reyna. \u201cSo if they could find a way to leverage those existing laws in order to protect whiteness in America, they\u2019re going to be more likely to be successful.\u201d Trump is by all accounts not a pious believer. He can, however, leverage evangelical grievances for support at the ballot box \u2014 and perhaps beyond. \u201cWe essentially have kind of a MAGA-controlled Republican Party, that is, both in terms of its ideas and its demography, a white Christian Nationalist Party,\u201d said Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cThe end game is the installation of an authoritarian regime that\u2019s about power and money and an oligarchy \u2014 and the ultimate end of that is the end of American democracy as we know it.\u201d WAIT!

        "text": "Sun speaks before eating a conceptual artwork\u2014a banana stuck to a wall with duct tape, for which he had paid $6.2 million, in Hong Kong, November 29, 2024.Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0on Judd Legum\u2019s Substack,\u00a0Popular Information, to which you can subscribe\u00a0here. In December, Popular Information\u00a0reported\u00a0that Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun purchased $30 million in crypto tokens from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a new venture backed by President Donald Trump and his family. Sun\u2019s purchase resulted in a cash windfall for Trump. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Sun sent a\u00a0joint letter\u00a0to a federal judge, asking for a stay of Sun\u2019s case. Today, the judge\u00a0granted\u00a0the SEC\u2019s request. In March 2023, the SEC\u00a0charged\u00a0Sun and three of his companies, accusing him of marketing unregistered securities and \u201cfraudulently manipulating the secondary market\u201d for a crypto token. The SEC accused Sun of wash trading, which involves buying and selling a token quickly to fraudulently manufacture artificial interest. Sun was also charged with paying celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and Soulja Boy, for endorsing his crypto \u201cwithout disclosing their compensation,\u201d which violates federal law. A few weeks after Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Sun publicly announced that he had\u00a0become WLF\u2019s largest investor, buying $30 million of its tokens. Sun added that his company, TRON, was \u201ccommitted to making America great again.\u201d Sun\u2019s purchase put millions in Trump\u2019s pocket. WLF was entitled to \u201c$30 million of initial net protocol revenue\u201d in a reserve \u201cto cover operating expenses, indemnities, and obligations.\u201d After the reserve was met, a company owned by Trump would receive \u201c75% of the net protocol revenues.\u201d Sun\u2019s purchase covered the entire reserve. As of December 1, this amounted to $18 million for Trump\u201475 percent of the revenues of all other tokens sold at the time. Sun also joined WLF as an advisor. While the purchase benefited Trump, WLF tokens are essentially worthless for Sun, as they are non-transferable and locked indefinitely. Nevertheless, Sun has since invested another $45 million in WLF, bringing his total investment to $75 million. This means Sun\u2019s purchases have sent more than $50 million to Trump, Bloomberg\u00a0reported. Sun has also continued to shower Trump with praise. On January 22, Sun\u00a0posted\u00a0on X, \u201cif I have made any money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump.\u201d Now, the SEC seems poised to negotiate a favorable settlement with Sun or drop the case entirely. Yesterday, the SEC and Sun filed a\u00a0joint request\u00a0for a 60-day stay in the case against Sun to \u201callow the Parties to explore a potential resolution.\u201d Sun seems pleased. He responded to news of the request for a stay on X,\u00a0posting\u00a0three handshake emojis. Last week, Brian Armstrong, CEO of the crypto trading platform Coinbase,\u00a0announced\u00a0that the SEC was dismissing its lawsuit against the company. The move came after Coinbase boosted Trump\u2019s crypto meme coin, donated $75 million to a pro-Trump Super PAC, and chipped in $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration celebration.

        "text": "Clara Jeffery21 hours ago Mother Jones illustration; Jim Macmillan/AP; Antonio Masiello/Getty; Clara Jeffery Mother Jones illustration; Jim Macmillan/AP; Antonio Masiello/Getty; Clara Jeffery In the fall of 1984, when I was a senior in high school in Washington, DC, the protests at the South African Embassy began. Civil rights leaders met with the ambassador of South Africa on Thanksgiving Eve. Timed for maximum press coverage, that meeting became a sit-in, and that sit-in launched a movement. Soon, there were protests at consulates across the country. College students held rallies, built \u201cshantytowns,\u201d and pushed their schools to divest. Area high school kids like me got in on protesting the embassy too. And we had a soundtrack. \u201cFree Nelson Mandela\u201d had been released by the Specials in March. The leader of that British ska band, Jerry Dammers, later admitted he didn\u2019t know much about Mandela before he went to an anti-apartheid concert in the UK, where a long-simmering boycott movement was rolling into a boil. The DC music scene was pretty wild then\u2014a bouillabaisse of go-go, R&B, punk, New Wave; there was breakdancing in the hallways during lunch hour\u2014and for some of us, ska was sort of a unified field theory. Musically but also culturally. (If you have a racist friend / now is the time, now is the time for your friendship to end.) But it wasn\u2019t just kids who cosplayed in checked socks or porkpie hats. In 1985, a month after I started college, Artists Against Apartheid recorded Steven Van Zandt\u2019s \u201c(I Ain\u2019t Going to Play) Sun City\u201d\u2014essentially the music world launching its own boycott on South Africa. The song was not (like, at all) great, but the wild cross-genre supergroup\u2014DJ Kool Herc, Lou Reed, Bonnie Raitt, Gil Scott-Heron, Pat Benatar, Bono, and Miles Davis to name but a very, very few\u2014guaranteed continual rotation on a relatively new cultural phenomenon: MTV. We were getting a collective education: Because South Africa was so dependent on Black labor and exports, if industrialized nations withheld trade and investments, we could backstop Black South Africans who\u2019d been directly resisting the Afrikaner regime for decades. So, suddenly, amazingly, we did. By 1986, Congress had imposed sanctions on South Africa and banned direct flights to it. Coca-Cola became the first major company to pull out of South Africa. Sports teams joined the musicians in refusing to play there. Divestment battles raged on campuses and boardrooms for the rest of the \u201980s. And they worked. South Africa\u2019s economy ground to a near halt. Mandela was freed in 1990, and negotiations to wind down apartheid began. By 1994, free elections were held and Mandela became president. I found myself reconstructing this history recently, as the protests and boycotts against Tesla began. Do you need a reminder as to why? Okay: Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2014the world\u2019s richest man, and Trump\u2019s biggest campaign donor; an unelected, ketamine-happy, video game cheating, transphobic, subsidy\u2013guzzling, deadbeat dad\u2014is leading a bunch of scythe-wielding mini-me shitposters through innards of the federal government, harvesting and compromising the most essential data of every taxpayer, government contractor, and NGO in America. Oh, and he\u2019s also supporting fascists, using apparent Nazi salutes, and blasting antisemitic and racist theories to his millions of followers. Anyway, the dude is bad news. And he\u2019s threatening to use his hundreds of billions\u2014again, money he would not have without US subsidies\u2014to take out any politician, foreign or domestic, who opposes his and Trump\u2019s agenda, which is a mix of toxic masculinity, grift, and a seeming desire to return to a gauzy form of racial apartheid. Musk, who was under federal investigation for racial discrimination in his Tesla factories\u2014that is, until Trump took over\u2014is supporting extremist movements across the world. Words like \u201capartheid\u201d and \u201cNazi\u201d shouldn\u2019t be tossed around lightly. Musk has denied he\u2019s a Nazi, and that his salute was a Nazi salute. But clear-eyed commentators aren\u2019t buying it, and white nationalists like Nick Fuentes are downright jubilant: \u201cThat was a straight up, like, Sieg Heil, like loving Hitler energy.\u201d And then there\u2019s Musk\u2019s history. His maternal grandparents were, according to Musk\u2019s own father, members of the Canadian neo-Nazi party who decamped to South Africa because they were fans of racial oppression. Musk has been pretty mum about what it was like to grow up in South Africa and the influence that had on him. (Today he holds US, Canadian, and South African citizenship.)\u00a0But the fact is that many white South Africans who left at that time did so because their position of privilege was coming to an end. In any case, once in the States, Musk joined forces with fellow South Africans Peter Thiel, David Sacks, and Roelof Botha\u2014grandson of former South African leader Pik Botha; now the head of venture capital giant Sequoia Capital\u2014to form PayPal. And they revealed themselves to be racial reactionaries. Thiel (who, according to his biographer, once called critiques of apartheid \u201coverblown\u201d) and Sacks wrote \u201cThe Case Against Affirmative Action\u201d for Stanford Magazine in 1996. They\u2019ve led concerted, organized attacks on DEI. Musk, who was under federal investigation for racial discrimination in his Tesla factories\u2014that is, until Trump took over\u2014is supporting extremist movements across the world, using Holocaust Remembrance Day to\u00a0tell Germans they should no longer feel \u201cguilt\u201d over it, and echoing South Africans who claim they\u2019re victims of \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d So yes, some people are too quick to label people they don\u2019t like as Nazis. But also, people who don\u2019t want to be called Nazis should avoid giving Nazi salutes. Now I want to talk about something else that was happening in the mid-\u201980s. Something else that gathered up musical supergroups and was big on MTV. It was famine. In Ethiopia, between 1983 and 1985, maybe a million people died. The nightly news was full of images of dying skeletal children, all the time. The causes were complex, but the immediate answer was simple: food. Again, it was musicians who rallied the world to the cause, with huge concerts like Live Aid, famous for Freddie Mercury\u2019s last transcendent performance, and cross-genre protest song collaborations. The Brits, led by Bob Geldof (who also produced Live Aid), went first with \u201cDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas.\u201d And then Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones, and Harry Belafonte gathered up a who\u2019s-who of American singers for \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d And yes, some of that plays as very cringe these days\u2014Ethiopians are mostly Christian, for starters. And we weren\u2019t totally blind to it back then either, as someone who played Cyndi Lauper in a high school send-up of \u201cWe Are the World\u201d can attest. But when you\u2019re trying to rally the world to the cause of dying children, corny works. All these efforts did raise millions for food relief, and, more importantly, focused the world\u2019s attention. In 1985, the United States Agency for International Development\u00a0created the Famine Early Warning Systems Network so the world would never be caught so flat-footed about famine again. Until now. Musk has gutted USAID, and its early famine warning system specifically, even as starvation stalks the people of Sudan. Thanks to his DOGE bros, almost 80 percent of emergency food kitchens in Sudan have been closed, and \u201cpeople are screaming from hunger in the streets,\u201d reports the BBC. Musk and Trump wanted to start with what they saw as the weakest, wokest government agency, to slaughter it and hang it on a pike as a warning not to disobey the king. What does the world\u2019s richest man have against the agency that helps the world\u2019s poorest people? Well, it was investigating his satellite company Starlink\u2019s contracts in Ukraine. But also, in their quest to cut trillions from the federal budget to finance tax cuts for billionaires like themselves, Musk and Trump have to believe they can get that money from things other than Social Security and Medicaid. So they\u2019re tapping into Americans\u2019 collective misbelief that we spend about a quarter of the budget on foreign aid\u2014in actuality, it is about 1 percent\u2014to claim they can square that math. And they\u2019re flooding the zone with disinformation with claims of USAID \u201cwaste and abuse,\u201d because this is their playbook. Never mind that they clearly don\u2019t know what USAID does, or that gutting it is also having devastating impacts on US farmers, who grow a lot of the food we provide as relief. Who benefits from eviscerating USAID? Basically foreign dictators like Vladimir Putin, who hates that this \u201csoft power\u201d was part of America\u2019s Ukrainian relief effort, or Xi Jinping, who sees our food aid to African countries as a plot to undermine China\u2019s \u201cbelt and road\u201d program of development. We don\u2019t just lose moral stature when we renounce foreign aid, we lose our competitive advantage in global relations too. So when Trump states in an executive order that USAID efforts \u201cdestabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries,\u201d please realize that this is echoing the talking points of Putin and Xi. But no matter, Musk and Trump wanted to start with what they saw as the weakest, wokest government agency, to slaughter it and hang it on a pike as a warning not to disobey the king. \u00a0Slashing USAID scratches a racist itch central to the MAGA cause. Let\u2019s not forget how Trump slurred \u201cshithole countries.\u201d Trump, who says Hitler did some \u201cgreat things,\u201d and says he wants generals like Hitler had. Trump, who believes he has \u201cgood genes.\u201d Trump, you know the list: housing discrimination, Central Park Five, birtherism, Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d \u201cvery fine people,\u201d \u201cgo back\u201d where they \u201ccame\u201d from, \u201cthey\u2019re eating the dogs, they\u2019re eating the cats.\u201d In the \u201980s, the American public had a much more rudimentary understanding of colonialism\u2019s dependence on racism than it does today. But even kids in high school knew that apartheid was wrong, and famine was wrong, and that these two things happening in Africa were somehow connected, and connected to America\u2019s dark racial history, and to the music we listened to and the future we hoped we represented. Our parents didn\u2019t have childhood friendships across races and sexes\u2014that would have been mostly impossible. But we did. We were naive (the white kids far more than the Black kids, it must be said) but not wrong in feeling that, even as we eye-rolled and camped it up when we sang along, that we are the children\u2026we\u2019re saving our own lives / It\u2019s true we\u2019ll make a better day, just you and me. On Valentine\u2019s Day, Sheryl Crow put her Tesla on a flatbed and donated the sale\u2019s proceeds to NPR. The following day, I went to the local Tesla dealership to witness the first in what has become an ongoing series of protests in San Francisco and across the country. The \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d movement is, as such movements usually are, organized by an oddball coalition of folks, including documentary filmmaker Alex Winter (also \u201cBill\u201d of Bill & Ted fame) and disinformation scholar Joan Donovan, who alleges that a donation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative prompted Harvard to cancel her research on Meta\u2019s role in online extremism. The goal is to get people to protest at dealerships, sell their cars, divest from any stock. Indivisible has joined the effort, organizing \u201cMusk or Us\u201d protests. There\u2019s a real strategy here: essentially that Tesla\u2019s stock is wildly overpriced\u2014it\u2019s both an automaker and a memestock, as John Herman notes\u2014and were it to approach a more reality-based level, Musk, who\u2019s super leveraged, could see his fortune decline precipitously. That could push a shareholder revolt and also weaken his threat to use his vast fortune to fund a primary against anybody who opposes Trump. And in any case, people need a place to locate their anger and fear. There are signs this is working. Tesla sales in Europe are catastrophically down\u201450 percent lower in January than from a year earlier, even as EV sales overall rose 34 percent. January sales were down 12 percent in California, and that\u2019s before DOGE started playing havoc with the country. Tesla\u2019s stock price has fallen 37 percent since its peak in December, knocking tens of billion off of Musk\u2019s wealth; 23 percent of that is in the last few weeks. And people are taking their rage out on individual Teslas, stickering and even vandalizing \u201cswasticars,\u201d especially cybertrucks, which were already performing horribly, in terms of sales and just\u2026performance. Opposition movements always seem hopeless until they\u2019re not. Apartheid existed for decades and then came crashing down rapidly. Talking to protestors at the San Francisco dealership, I was struck by how many of them had never been to any kind of protest before. Some of them were Tesla owners. One guy told me he wasn\u2019t able to sell his car right now, but he was posting to Tesla owner forums to tell people to turn off features so as to deny the company revenue, or to be an activist shareholder if they were one. In less than two weeks, such protests have spread all over the country. The news is full of tales of Tesla owners with buyer\u2019s remorse. Etsy shops are selling bumper stickers that say things like: \u201cI bought this before I knew Elon was crazy.\u201d On a walk through my neighborhood last weekend, I saw a woman purposefully lead her dog over to pee on a cybertruck, and a Tesla sedan with a handwritten sign that said: \u201cHi! I also think Elon sucks. I bought this car 5 years ago. Please stop keying my car for your protest. I agree with you [heart].\u201d Less than half a block later I came across another Tesla sedan, freshly keyed. \u201cWe hate him too,\u201d read a sign hung from the offices above the Tesla dealership showroom. We are in early days. Trump has been in office just over a month. \u201cBig Balls\u201d and the rest of the DOGE marauders have only been at it a few weeks. Tesla protests are even newer. It\u2019s possible that even if a boycott were to wipe out some of Musk\u2019s wealth, sketchy government contracts for things like $400 million in armored Teslas, or a $2 billion FAA deal for Starlink, will more than make up for it. Mass movements require mass awareness, and we\u2019re not collectively tuning into the same newscasts or music videos, and Musk meanwhile owns a disinformation factory. Boycotts rarely have the kind of impact activists hope for; they tend to be too diffuse or too hotly contested. But opposition movements always seem hopeless until they\u2019re not. Apartheid existed for decades and then came crashing down rapidly. We didn\u2019t know that its heirs would be wreaking havoc on this country four decades later, but history isn\u2019t an unbroken line that goes up and to the right. Some of the bad stuff comes back and has to be fought again. The South Africa apartheid regime was defeated. Maybe one South African oligarch can be too.

        "title": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s Investment in Donald Trump Pays Off Bigly \u2013 Mother Jones",
        "text": "Mother Jones; Gavriil Grigorov/AFP/Getty The below article\u00a0first appeared\u00a0in David Corn\u2019s newsletter,\u00a0Our Land.\u00a0The newsletter\u00a0comes out twice a week (most of the time) and provides behind-the-scenes stories and articles about politics, media, and culture. Subscribing costs just $5 a month\u2014but you can\u00a0sign up for a free 30-day trial. Talk about a good ROI. Vladimir Putin\u2019s investment in Donald Trump is sure paying off. In recent days, Trump has promoted Moscow\u2019s horrendously false talking points, excoriating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \u201cdictator\u201d and blaming Ukraine for the brutal war that Putin, a real dictator, launched. He also kicked off talks with Russia to end the war and left out Ukraine. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better scenario for Putin.\u00a0And at the United Nations, the Trump administration proposed a resolution on the war that declined to hold Russia responsible for the conflict. (It was amended to include language blaming Moscow and then passed, with Washington abstaining.) Plus, the chaos caused by Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s blitzkrieg against US government agencies could well redound to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage. With national security agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and others\u2014and the Pentagon under siege due to this assault, their capabilities to defend the nation from threats posed by Russia or other adversaries will be diminished. All the Trump/Musk-generated conflict is in sync with Putin\u2019s long-standing aim to sow discord in the United States. What a good deal for Putin: Trump siding with him on Ukraine, legitimizing his tyrannical reign, and breaking with Western allies. Moreover, on her first day in office, Attorney General Pam Bondi\u00a0disbanded\u00a0the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force, which sought to counter secret operations waged by Russia, China, and other foes to affect US elections. She also cut back enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a tool used by the feds to neutralize malign influence and disinformation operations. And now the FBI is being run by Kash Patel, a MAGA provocateur who has hailed the January 6 rioters and who has\u00a0echoed\u00a0Putin\u2019s phony claim that Moscow did not clandestinely intervene in the 2016 campaign and assist Trump. What a good deal for Putin: Trump siding with him on Ukraine, legitimizing his tyrannical reign, and breaking with Western allies. The US government and national security community in turmoil. Washington undermining its standing throughout the world and diminishing its global influence. And a US administration opening the door for more Russian covert attacks and holding Moscow blameless for its previous assaults on American democracy. No wonder Putin did what he could to help Trump win the presidency\u2014not once but thrice. The Trumpers will tell you that \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d was a hoax, a witch hunt and a diabolical Deep State plot. That\u2019s another con that Trump whipped up, with\u00a0a boatload of help from Patel. But as the Trump-Putin relationship returns to prominence and as an American sellout of Ukraine looms, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Trump sits in the White House partly because of Putin\u2019s skullduggery and his own betrayal of America. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it. Just ask Marco Rubio, who\u2019s now Trump\u2019s secretary of state. As I\u2019ve pointed out before in this newsletter, in August 2020, Rubio, then the GOP chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, released a bipartisan\u00a0966-page report\u00a0on the Trump-Russia scandal. It\u2019s the most comprehensive public account of Putin\u2019s attack on the 2016 election. It concludes that Putin \u201cordered the Russian effort to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Hillary Clinton and her campaign for president\u201d and that he did so \u201cto help the Trump Campaign\u2026and undermine the US democratic process.\u201d The report points out that \u201cthe Trump Campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia\u201d\u2014that is, Trump helped cover up Putin\u2019s culpability. The report also reveals that Paul Manafort, the chief executive of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, secretly met with a Russian intelligence office who was possibly connected to Russia\u2019s hack-and-leak operation and shared private campaign information with him. (Does that sound like possible collusion?) So no hoax. Putin schemed to place Trump in the White House, and Trump aided and abetted the operation by falsely denying its existence. For years, the Republicans and MAGA-aligned media used a Kremlin-orchestrated smear to advance the impression that Biden was crooked. The Russian operation helped Trump win in 2016. In the final weeks of a tight election, it produced a steady stream of damaging leaks about Clinton that impeded her campaign. The Kremlin also ran secret projects that tried to assist Trump in 2020 and 2024. What\u2019s the source for that? The first Trump administration. In 2020, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the Treasury Department each\u00a0publicly disclosed\u00a0that Russia was conducting a disinformation campaign spreading false information about Joe Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine to smear the former vice president and Trump\u2019s main rival. Rudy Giuliani, then a lawyer for Trump, peddled this phony, Russia-generated propaganda to try to undermine Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. Such bunk became the basis for the long-running and false GOP narrative that Biden was corrupt. This line of attack failed in 2020, but the Republicans stuck with it. After they won control of the House of Representatives in 2022, they hyped the Biden allegations cooked up by Russian agents and used this disinformation to try to discredit Biden with the false charge that he headed a \u201cBiden crime family.\u201d They cited this bogus claim as the basis for an impeachment investigation. That probe went nowhere, but for years, the Republicans and MAGA-aligned media used the Kremlin-orchestrated smear to advance the impression that Biden was crooked\u2014a sham that Trump enthusiastically promoted and exploited in the 2024 campaign. Russia\u2019s effort last year to help Trump was not a secret. In the spring of 2024, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines publicly\u00a0testified\u00a0before Congress that Russia was once again waging information warfare to influence the presidential election, obviously to benefit Trump. This would come to include a host of disinformation projects. But none of this became major news stories\u2014a true failure of the media. And, it would turn out, one of the key false allegations the Republicans and their media mouthpieces pushed\u2014that Biden and his son had covertly pocketed $10 million in bribes from a Ukrainian energy firm\u2014originated with an FBI informant with ties\u00a0to Russian intelligence officers. (In December, this informant, Alexander Smirnov, pleaded guilty to lying to the bureau about this supposed scheme.) Whatever the Russians did last year to help Trump will be buried by what we can now call the Trump Deep State. There\u2019s been no good review of the operations the Kremlin implemented to swing the 2024 election to Trump. And with Trump in charge, Patel at the FBI, John Ratcliffe (another Trump loyalist) heading the CIA, and Tulsi Gabbard serving as the director of national intelligence, there\u2019s as much chance of one being ordered as Trump attending a racial sensitivity seminar. Whatever the Russians did last year to help Trump will be buried by what we can now call the Trump Deep State. There\u2019s certainly a lot more to the Trump-Putin connection than this brief rundown. In 2013, when Trump announced he\u2019d be holding his Miss Universe contest in Moscow, he tweeted about Putin becoming \u201chis new best friend.\u201d (Putin was already recognized at this point as an antidemocratic thug.) While in Moscow for the event,\u00a0Trump was obsessed with meeting Putin\u2014which never happened. But the Miss Universe pageant\u00a0netted\u00a0Trump $2.3 million\u2014mostly because his partner in the endeavor, a Russian oligarch who was close to Putin, paid Trump a very generous licensing fee and absorbed millions in losses. (Was this a sweetheart deal with a pro-Putin billionaire?) During the 2016 campaign, Trump tried to set up a megadeal to develop a tower in Moscow and requested help from Putin\u2019s office. (He never told voters about this.) And his top campaign aides met with a Russian emissary after being informed the Kremlin wanted to secretly help his campaign. Of course, Trump has a long history of fawning remarks about Putin, and top administration officials during his first term\u00a0wondered\u00a0about his unending and bizarre affinity for Putin. (This past week the\u00a0Mirror\u00a0reported\u00a0that a former Kazakh intelligence chief, who claimed he had served in the KGB, said that Trump was recruited by the KGB in 1987. There is no way to evaluate this claim.) The Trump-Russia tale has largely been smothered by Trump\u2019s endless screams of \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201choax.\u201d But as Trump moves to help Putin obtain an advantageous end to the cruel and criminal war he initiated, the full context of their relationship ought to be center stage. Yet it\u2019s not been. One example: Last week, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0published a\u00a0story\u00a0reporting on Trump\u2019s \u201cfamiliar pattern\u201d of \u201celevating Kremlin talking points\u201d\u2014an accurate characterization. But not until halfway into the piece did it refer to Putin\u2019s attack on the 2016 election. The article said that the Senate Intelligence Committee report had concluded that the Russian government \u201cengaged in an aggressive, multifaceted effort to influence, or attempt to influence, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\u201d But the\u00a0Times\u00a0did not point out that the committee declared that this operation had been conducted to help Trump triumph. The newspaper noted the Russian endeavor had \u201cdamaged\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign but said nothing about Trump\u2019s attempt to cover up Russia\u2019s role. The\u00a0Times\u00a0also did not mention Putin\u2019s secret efforts in 2020 and 2024 to assist Trump. It downplayed the whole Trump-Russia saga. Trump is acting like Putin\u2019s handmaid\u2014and pursuing policies and creating discord that could well undermine American democracy and fray, if not shatter, the Western alliance. Trump\u2019s love affair with Putin has been something of a mystery. Less mysterious is the basic fact that Putin helped Trump reach the White House initially and mounted covert actions in 2020 and 2024 to boost Trump\u2019s chances. What could be more relevant at a time when Trump is demonizing Zelenskyy and trying to broker a resolution of the war that will favor Putin and his regime over a democratically elected ally of the United States? Putin wanted Trump in the White House, and he screwed with American elections to make that happen. Now Trump is acting like Putin\u2019s handmaid\u2014and pursuing policies and creating discord that could well undermine American democracy and fray, if not shatter, the Western alliance. MAGA refuses to see this. Congressional Republicans won\u2019t face it. And the media doesn\u2019t fully cover this all-important backstory. Whether or not there are secrets to the Trump-Putin relationship that we don\u2019t know, it\u2019s clear that Putin made a clever bet, and it looks like he\u2019s about to cash in.

        "title": "Perhaps the Biggest Winner in Germany\u2019s Election: Nuclear Power \u2013 Mother Jones",
        "text": "The cooling tower of the Isar II Nuclear Power Plant in Bavaria, Germany.Imago/ZUMA This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0on the author\u2019s substack,\u00a0Field Notes with Alexander C Kaufman, to which you can subscribe\u00a0here. Germany\u2019s conservatives won the national election on Sunday, while the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party\u00a0nearly doubled\u00a0its share of the vote from the last election to secure a strong second-place finish. Nuclear energy may be the big winner. Europe\u2019s largest economy shuttered its last reactors two years ago in what was meant to be an irreversible exit from atomic energy. But surging energy prices and electricity demand are driving calls to revive Germany\u2019s nuclear power industry. As the victorious Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, wrote in their\u00a0party manifesto, \u201cWe are resolved to stick with the nuclear energy option, counting on research on nuclear energy in its 4th and 5th generation, small modular reactors, and fusion reactors. We are assessing the resumption of operation of the recently-shut-down nuclear power plants.\u201d The CDU\u2019s leader and Germany\u2019s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said last month he regrets withdrawing from nuclear power. \u201cWe are examining whether we should build these small modular reactors\u2014perhaps together with France,\u201d Merz told the weekly magazine\u00a0Der Spiegel. In an interview last week on\u00a0CNBC, Klaus Wiener, a CDU lawmaker in the Bundestag, called the country\u2019s nuclear phaseout \u201ca huge mistake.\u201d \u201cThey were technically sound, they were doing well, and safe\u2014but the government has, for ideological reasons, decided to shut them down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have used them longer. That would have made a big difference in energy prices and supply.\u201d Yet Wiener cautioned that turning the shuttered plants back on was unlikely, echoing statements Germany\u2019s biggest utilities made in\u00a0recent calls with investors. \u201cNow unfortunately, three years down the road, these nuclear power plants, they can be recovered but that would be very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes three to five years, possibly, and it\u2019ll take a lot of money. If we want to reengage again with nuclear energy, it will not be about this generation of nuclear power plants.\u201d That the CDU\u2014the party once led by former Chancellor Angela Merkel, who oversaw the nuclear exit\u2014is now willing to support atomic energy is a major shift. A\u00a0poll\u00a0taken in 2022 found 53 percent of Germans opposed quitting nuclear. By the eve of the final shutdowns the following April, 59 percent said the phaseout was \u201cwrong.\u201d While it\u2019s likely only a small factor in its sobering rise to power, the AfD\u2014whose\u00a0ties to neo-Nazis\u00a0and\u00a0defenses of the Gestapo\u00a0proved too radical even for their\u00a0former political allies in France (though not for Elon Musk or\u00a0Vice President JD Vance) has long been the lone party representing that majority view. Founded two years after the Fukushima disaster, the AfD previously stood as\u00a0the only party\u00a0to oppose the phaseout pushed by everyone from the center-right, which initiated the shut-downs, to the center-left and Greens\u2014under whose leadership the last plants closed. Now the AfD is\u00a0pushing to completely reverse\u00a0the closures and undo policies that support renewables such as wind and solar power. (Nuclear is not renewable, because the uranium fuel is spent in the power-generation process.) \u201cWhat our government is doing\u2026they\u2019re destroying\u2014they\u2019re blowing them up\u2014our nuclear plants,\u201d Beatrix von Storch, an AfD member of the Bundestag, said in an interview on\u00a0Deutsche Welle\u00a0last month. \u201cWe can see our energy is no longer stable. It\u2019s far too expensive.\u201d Merz has ruled out any coalition government with the AfD. Last month, however, the German parliament\u00a0narrowly approved\u00a0a nonbinding resolution Merz put forward to call to turn away more migrants, thanks to support from AfD lawmakers. The big question now is whether Merz will lower his \u201cfirewall\u201d against working with the AfD to bring back nuclear power.

        "title": "Trump Posts AI Video of Ethnically Cleansed Gaza \u2013 Mother Jones",
        "text": "Shawn Thew/ZUMA On Tuesday, just before midnight, Donald Trump posted a grotesque AI-generated video on social media that depicts a future Gaza as his proposed \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d A sleek palm-tree-lined boulevard, in the video, is watched over by an enormous gold statue of the American president. Palestinians, it seems, are absent\u2014aside from maybe a few belly dancers. In their place, a yassified Elon Musk eats hummus while Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lounge by the pool. A chintzy \u201cTrump Gaza\u201d hotel and cloying chant of  \u201cTrump Gaza is finally here!\u201d round out the fantasy of Trump\u2019s promise to criminally expel roughly two million people and take ownership of the enclave. The video\u2019s aesthetics, which mix the glass towers of Miami with the Dear-Leaderism of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baghdad, distract from a more fundamental reality: The president of the United States is using AI slop to sell war crimes and a potential genocide he considers a real estate deal.\u00a0It is pitching ethnic cleansing with a meme. Trump just posted a \u201cTrump Gaza\u201d propaganda video featuring a giant golden statue of himself, dancing bearded women, and himself partying with a woman who is not his wife. pic.twitter.com/4FWn175PSj Gazans, most of whom are refugees descended from residents expelled from what is now Israel, have made abundantly clear that they do not want to be forced from their land once again. Nor, as Trump has called for doing, do they want to be barred from ever returning\u2014particularly to make way for an American-owned Mediterranean style escape for global elites. The only way to accomplish Trump\u2019s plan would be to commit atrocities that evoke some of the darkest moments in contemporary history. And it would require doing so in the wake of a war in which Israel\u2014with the help of American bombs\u2014has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, including more than 17,000 children. On paper, Trump\u2019s plan is being taken seriously by his underlings. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, are talking about bringing real estate executives together to hatch a plan to rebuild the enclave. The pair reportedly want to hold a White House summit devoted to the topic that, according to the Journal, \u201cwould include a public display, potentially with large cranes and other showy pieces of equipment.\u201d The planning follows Trump\u2019s claim during the campaign that Gaza could be \u201cbetter than Monaco\u201d because it has \u201cthe best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything.\u201d For now, Trump\u2019s vision of America controlling an ethnically cleansed Gaza appears to be mostly fantasy. The more immediate risk is the signal sent to Netanyahu and his hard-right allies. Extreme Jewish supremacists like Knesset member Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been calling for Israel to resettle Gaza, now know they have even less reason to fear that the United States will do anything if and when they steal even more land from Palestinians.

        "title": "Republicans and Elon Musk Are Also Causing a Constitutional Crisis in the States \u2013 Mother Jones",
        "text": "Mother Jones illustration; Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty On February 20, a dark money group funded by Elon Musk began running ads attacking progressive judge Susan Crawford, who is running in a Wisconsin Supreme Court election in April that will decide the balance of power on the court. Another super-PAC created by Musk has spent $2 million on voter turnout efforts in support of conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general who was appointed to a judgeship in suburban Milwaukee by former Republican Governor Scott Walker. Collectively, groups tied to Musk have already spent more than $4.2 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race\u2014a clear sign that his plans for oligarchy extend well beyond Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve been tracking these races for many years,\u201d says Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the Judiciary Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this much interest in a state supreme court election coming directly from the White House.\u201d \u201cIn North Carolina, there has been a multi-year, hyper focused effort among political actors in the state to gain and keep control over the state supreme court. It is getting harder and harder for the public to think of these courts as doing anything different than raw politics.\u201d On the same day the Musk-funded ads started running in Wisconsin, the Republican majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court issued a little-noticed decision that increases the likelihood that Republicans will overturn the election of Democratic State Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs\u2014the last uncertified race from November 2024. These two developments show the extraordinary steps Republicans are taking to rig the political system in their bid to preserve state power. With all the focus on a constitutional crisis in Donald Trump\u2019s Washington, it\u2019s easy to overlook how a similar dynamic is playing out at the state level. The GOP majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court blocked the state election board in January from certifying Riggs\u2019 victory after two recounts confirmed her 734-vote lead. More than two months after the election, the court finally sent the case back to the lower courts, but three of six justices, including Republican Chief Justice Paul Newby, expressed their support for overturning the election and throwing out more than 65,000 ballots challenged by Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin, even though he hasn\u2019t presented a single instance of someone voting illegally. On February 20, the court ruled 4-2 that it would not bypass the court of appeals, on which Griffin sits, further delaying any final ruling. Here\u2019s why that matters: a lower court has already rejected Griffin\u2019s voter challenges. So too has the state board of elections. But if the court of appeals, which has a 12-3 Republican majority, rules in favor of their colleague Griffin and the state supreme court deadlocks 3-3, the appeals court would have the final say. The fix appears to be in. The chief judge of the appeals court, Chris Dillon, will choose the panel of judges that hears Griffin\u2019s appeal. Chief Justice Newby, who Griffin has called a \u201cgood friend and mentor,\u201d appointed Dillon as the top judge last year, breaking with precedent to oust sitting Republican Judge Donna Stroud, who was deemed too liberal by hard-right Republicans. Fellow Republican judges, including Griffin and North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Phil Berger Jr., donated to a primary campaign against Stroud. Dillon owes his power to Newby\u2014and Newby has made it very clear he\u2019ll go to unprecedented lengths to put his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Griffin on the court. If that wasn\u2019t enough of an old boys club, another member of the court of appeals, Tom Murry, donated $5,000 to Griffin\u2019s legal effort to challenge Riggs\u2019s victory but has not recused himself from potentially hearing the case despite calls for him to do so. Newby\u2019s wife, along with the wife of another Republican state supreme court justice, donated the maximum amount, $6,400, to Griffin\u2019s legal fund. Musk\u2019s donations may have as much to do with self-interest as ideology. His first tweet about the race, urging his followers to \u201cvote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d came a week after Tesla sued the state for ruling that it could not open car dealerships in Wisconsin. North Carolina Republicans won a majority on the state supreme court in part by changing the rules of how these races function, including eliminating public financing for judicial elections and turning previously nonpartisan contests into partisan races. \u201cIn North Carolina, there has been a multi-year, hyper focused effort among political actors in the state to gain and keep control over the state supreme court,\u201d says Keith. \u201cIt is getting harder and harder for the public to think of these courts as doing anything different than raw politics, and to have any reason to trust their decisions as worth following. And a state supreme court overturning an election after the fact and disenfranchising voters in order to get their ally on the bench with them would only make it harder for the public to trust the decisions coming out of this court.\u201d In Wisconsin, top GOP donors are trying to buy the state supreme court race so they don\u2019t have to overturn it. Schimel is running as an openly MAGA candidate in the ostensibly nonpartisan race. He attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, claimed the January 6 insurrectionists did not receive fair trials, and said he\u2019d welcome Trump\u2019s endorsement. Musk\u2019s America PAC has spent $2.2 million on get-out-the-vote efforts and digital ads, while another group funded by him, Building America\u2019s Future, has spent $2 million on ads and other forms of media attacking Crawford for allegedly giving a lenient sentence to a child molester, advancing the longtime GOP playbook of attacking Democrats as soft on crime. Another ad by Wisconsin\u2019s top business group, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, calls the progressive judge \u201cCatch \u2018N Release Crawford.\u201d Musk\u2019s donations may have as much to do with self-interest as ideology. His first tweet about the race, urging his followers to \u201cvote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d came a week after Tesla sued the state for ruling that it could not open car dealerships in Wisconsin. Schimel has praised Musk\u2019s intervention in the race, practically begging dark money groups to get involved on his behalf. So far, outside groups backing Schimel have spent more than to $8 million supporting his candidacy, in a race that is expected to be the most expensive state judicial contest in history. This could give Schimel a major advantage after progressives flipped control of the court in 2023, when Democratic-backed candidate Janet Protasiewicz outspent her conservative opponent Dan Kelly. \u201cAt this point, the difference between spending on the right and spending on the left is noteworthy,\u201d Keith says. He estimates $18 million has been spent supporting Schimel and $8 million supporting Crawford from their campaigns and outside allies. \u201cIt seems like voters are probably seeing a lot more ads in favor of Schimel or attacking Crawford than they are the other way around.\u201d State supreme court races have become increasingly contentious as the US Supreme Court has devolved power to the states and issues like abortion rights and redistricting are increasingly decided at the state level. After the progressive majority took control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in April 2023, they struck down the gerrymandered state legislative maps that gave Republicans lopsided majorities for over a decade. The court could soon consider the fate of the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban, a law restricting collective bargaining for public sector unions, and the legality of Wisconsin\u2019s congressional maps. Similarly, when Republicans won a majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court in the 2022 elections, they reversed a previous court decision striking down the state\u2019s gerrymandered legislative and congressional maps. That allowed the GOP-controlled legislature to draw a new gerrymandered US House map that gave the party three new seats\u2014just enough to ensure Republicans retained control of chamber and could rubber stamp Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing awareness of how state high courts are going to be involved in deciding what sets of rules and laws upcoming elections take place under,\u201d says Keith. \u201cAnd so if you care about upcoming elections as a political donor, you may increasingly be caring about who sits on state supreme courts. And that that may be one reason that Musk is getting involved.\u201d It\u2019s also the case that many of the GOP\u2019s anti-democratic actions at the state level over the past decade have furthered the autocratic turn of the national Republican Party. For example, the GOP-controlled legislature in Wisconsin stripped power from Democratic Governor Tony Evers during a lame duck session after his election in 2018. Evers called it a precursor to January 6. Similarly, North Carolina Republicans, in a lame-duck session after the 2024 election that was supposed to deal exclusively with hurricane relief, took away the power from the Democratic governor to name a majority of members on the state and local election boards\u2014the very entities who first rejected Griffin\u2019s attempt to throw out tens of thousands of ballots. The high courts in states like North Carolina and Wisconsin will rule on the validity of such laws\u2014and their decisions will shape the rules of elections up and down the ballot in critical races for years to come.

        "title": "Trump Named in Epstein Files Released by His Own Administration | The New Republic",
        "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s name has appeared seven times in the \u201cEpstein files\u201d his own administration has released. The files\u2014released after a photo op with right-wing influencers holding large shiny binders\u2014don\u2019t seem to contain anything that isn\u2019t already public information. They include flight logs, an evidence list, and redacted pages from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s address book. Trump was first mentioned on page 24 of the first flight log, on October 11, 1993. He was mentioned again, twice, on page 2 of the log on May 15, 1994, as were his then-wife, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany Trump, and their nanny. Each of the listed dates also had Epstein\u2019s own initials on them, suggesting that he was on the exact same flight as Trump for at least three of the seven times Trump\u2019s name shows up in the flight log. This release has completely failed to live up to the hype. The influencer photo op paired with the obvious lack of new information, along with the knowledge that there are apparently thousands more pages of Epstein files, infuriated the MAGA faithful who\u2019d been waiting for vindication of their sex trafficking cabal conspiracy theories. A name in the flight log does not confirm or deny any criminal activity, but it does confirm that Trump had a real relationship with the convicted predator, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting federal trial. Attorney General Pam Bondi hinted that more files will be released Friday. Trump has yet to comment. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez captured the mood of the moment in an interview this week with NPR. The New York congresswoman said that these days, government is working very well for the wealthy, while often failing ordinary people. \u201cEverything feels increasingly like a scam,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. \u201cNot only are grocery prices going up, but it\u2019s like everything has a fee and a surcharge. And I think that anger is put out at government.\u201d The congresswoman expressed her anger at the cuts to the federal government that President Trump and Elon Musk have been pursuing for the past month. \u201cI mean to the FAA? No. To the NIH? No,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t want someone taking a wrecking ball to someone\u2019s chemotherapy to just see what happens.\u201d She called out Trump administration officials for threatening to investigate her\u2014and specifically Tom Homan, President Trump\u2019s border czar, who said last week that Ocasio-Cortez was violating the law by trying \u201cto educate people how they evade law enforcement.\u201d \u201cI was informing all of my constituents of their constitutional protections and in particular, their constitutional protections against illegal search and seizure,\u201d she said, and had a question for the Justice Department: \u201cWell, there is a member of the Trump administration who is threatening and seeks to open an inquiry. And are you going to do it?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that she sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi after the interview, which said, \u201cI write to request clarity on whether the Department of Justice has yielded to political pressure and attempts to weaponize the agency against elected officials whose speech they disagree with.\u201d Donald Trump has now been brutally fact-checked by two different world leaders over his incessant whining about getting a payday from war-torn Ukraine. During a joint press conference Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump was once again complaining that the U.S. had been scammed into sending billions in military aid to Ukraine, while other nations were making their money back. \u201cWe wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had,\u201d Trump griped. \u201cYou know, they get their money back by giving money, we don\u2019t get the money back. Biden made a deal, he put in $350 billion, and I thought it was a very unfair situation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours,\u201d Starmer interjected. \u201cI mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given.\u201d Trump: They get their money back by giving money. We don't get the money back. I thought it was a very unfair situation.Starmer: We're not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. pic.twitter.com/oXuFZpZdu8 Starmer\u2019s correction was nearly identical to a fact-check from French President Emmanuel Macron\u00a0 during a press conference Monday, when he was also forced to push back against the grievance-addled U.S. president\u2019s false claims that Europe was simply \u201cloaning\u201d their money to Ukraine. \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank. We paid,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe paid 60 percent of the total effort, and it was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantee, grants, and we provided real money, to be clear.\u201d Macron had emphasized that Ukraine ought to be compensated by Russia for the deaths of citizens and destruction of property. Trump\u2019s obsession with getting paid back for America\u2019s supposedly humanitarian and military assistance has become a central feature of his efforts to resolve Russia\u2019s deadly invasion of Ukraine. Never mind how strange it is to demand payment for emergency aid in the first place. U.S. and Ukraine officials entered the final stages of a contentious mineral agreement, which would funnel half of the Eastern European nation\u2019s rare earth minerals\u2014hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of materials\u2014into the American market. The deal would serve to pay back some of what the U.S. spent but wouldn\u2019t do anything to ensure Ukraine\u2019s security or economic interests in the future. Trump has expressed hostility toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claiming he was enjoying the \u201cgravy train\u201d of U.S. aid and calling him a \u201cdictator.\u201d But on Thursday, Trump claimed he didn\u2019t remember saying that. The official social media account for the House Judiciary GOP rickrolled the Epstein files on Thursday. On the heels of a political stunt in which the Trump administration gifted large binders labeled \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase One\u201d to a cadre of MAGA influencers, Republicans in office suddenly decided it would be kosher to use the abhorrent sex trafficking case to make a quick joke. \u201c#BREAKING: EPSTEIN FILES RELEASED,\u201d the official X account for the House Judiciary GOP posted alongside a shortened URL that actually directed users to Rick Astley\u2019s music video for \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d The disgusting gimmick appalled users on the social media platform, some of whom were shocked that the Republican Party would risk the American public\u2019s cybersecurity by sending them down an unknown web address to access highly coveted, classified information. \u201cSending the American people to a tiny url that redirects to an unknown destination is a great way to ensure trust in the cybersecurity domain,\u201d posted one user. For years, Jeffrey Epstein orchestrated a child sex trafficking ring in which he raped countless young girls and helped his wealthy and famous affiliates do the same. He allegedly killed himself in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Earlier this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged to release the details of Epstein\u2019s flight logs as well as a list of his connections to the public by Thursday, though that still has not happened. \u201cThe \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 are something of a white whale for the QAnon wing of MAGA, as they believe that its release would reveal the villainous liberal cabal that secretly coordinates international child sex trafficking,\u201d wrote The New Republic\u2019s Malcolm Ferguson. \u201cMany in the conspiracy community believe that Epstein\u2019s death\u2014and the botched release of this list\u2014is part of a greater \u2018deep state\u2019 coverup.\u201d So the White House\u2019s gag earlier in the day, unsurprisingly, ruffled feathers on the far right. After some MAGA talking heads\u2014including DC Draino\u2019s Rogan O\u2019Handley, Libs of TikTok\u2019s Chaya Raichik, Liz Wheeler, and Mike Cernovich\u2014refused to share the contents of the binders after waltzing out of the executive office, others on the right were left screaming and scrambling online for actual details related to Epstein\u2019s activities. \u201cTHERE ARE NO EPSTEIN FILES!!!\u201d Laura Loomer claimed on X. \u201cTHE BINDERS ARE PROPS.

Starmer\u2019s visit led to several bumpy moments between the two world leaders. At one point, Trump hinted at a tense discussion between himself and Starmer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been terrific in our discussions. You\u2019re a very tough negotiator, however.

At another point, when asked to respond to Trump\u2019s comments about making Canada the fifty-first state, Starmer tried to reply, before being forcefully cut off by the president. \u201cYou mentioned Canada. I think you\u2019re trying to find a divide between us that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re the closest of nations, and we had very good discussions today, but we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Trump interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.

The Trump administration is having trouble bringing back fired avian flu experts to take on the spread of the disease, which has caused egg prices to skyrocket. Earlier this month, the administration fired 25 percent of the employees in an office testing for avian flu, as well as scientists and inspectors, as part of its mass purge of federal workers. The layoffs partially shut down a research facility at the Department of Agriculture, interrupting anti-bird flu efforts. Administration officials are attempting to tout a $1 billion plan to combat the disease, as well as plans to import eggs from overseas. But that plan doesn\u2019t include bringing back fired avian flu workers, whom the USDA is struggling to rehire. The agency is running into logistical issues as well as skeptical ex-employees, some of whom aren\u2019t convinced they should return as Trump and Elon Musk continue to fire federal workers indiscriminately. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are going to want to come back,\u201d one anonymous USDA employee told Politico. \u201cNow there\u2019s this perception that federal jobs are not secure. I think they permanently damaged these services.\u201d USDA supervisors have also been told to justify every bird flu employee being rehired, and some employees who have come back still don\u2019t have laptop computers. It\u2019s not clear if all of the fired avian flu employees have been asked to come back, and some of the reinstated workers were even sent emails urging them to take the Trump administration\u2019s deferred resignation plan, according to two sources. \u201cRather than measure twice and cut once, it\u2019s more like everyone is on the chopping block and then, \u2018Oh shit we cut the wrong people,\u2019\u201d a USDA employee told Politico. This could be the first test of how the Trump administration handles a crisis with Musk wielding so much power within the government. Will Trump and Musk prioritize the need to combat the disease, prevent a potential pandemic, and safeguard the country? Or will they stubbornly continue to claim achievements while they gut crucial parts of the government? Elon Musk suddenly wants to increase the size of the federal workforce. \u201cThere is a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X Thursday. \u201cIf you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so.\u201d Musk\u2019s desperate call to bring retired federal employees back into the fray after single-handedly undermining the security of every single government job is inane on its face. It gets even more so when considering the actual requirements for the job. Individuals interested in becoming an air traffic controller must be younger than 31 years of age to apply for the position, according to the Federal Aviation Administration website. Air traffic controllers are permitted to serve in the position until they are 56 years old. So, it\u2019s immediately unclear how Musk\u2019s plan to lure retirees back would even be possible. Although the solution proposed by the unelected bureaucrat is decidedly unserious, the problem straining air traffic control towers is anything but. The New York Times reported in 2023 that nearly every air traffic control site in the country was understaffed, leading to the staffers in the high-stress position being overworked. After a deadly plane crash at the Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., earlier this month, the Times reported that its air traffic control tower had a staff of 19 controllers\u2014as opposed to the 30 recommended by the FAA and controllers\u2019 union. As of September 2024, the FAA had 14,000 air traffic controllers in its employ, having surpassed its yearly goal to bring aboard 1,800 new hires. The hiring spree was implemented to reverse a \u201cdecades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline,\u201d according to a post from the FAA. But earlier this month, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping layoffs, a whopping 400 FAA jobs were eliminated. According to the Trump administration, none of them were air traffic controllers. \u201cOn the layoffs, these were probationary employees\u2014meaning they had only been at the FAA for less than two years, represented less than 1 percent of FAA\u2019s more than 45,000 employees,\u201d said Department of Transportation spokesperson Halee Dobbins. Last month, Trump issued an executive order to \u201cimmediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring\u201d at the FAA, claiming that it \u201cprioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency.\u201d Elon Musk may be throwing his weight around the federal government, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet are happy about it. Trump\u2019s aides are reportedly struggling to contain internal administration disputes after Musk threatened mass layoffs over the weekend for federal employees who refused to submit a progress report to the Department of Government Efficiency, Reuters reported Thursday. Responding to the president\u2019s request that he become \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in sizing down the federal government, Musk wrote in a social media post Saturday that all federal employees must self-report five things that they achieved in the previous week before midnight on Monday, or else they would face immediate termination. Federal workers reportedly received an email from the Office of Personnel Management shortly afterward that echoed Musk\u2019s post. But by Monday, many federal agencies fronted by Trump\u2019s own appointees had simply told their staffers not to respond. Those included the Department of Defense, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the agency that issued the directive: the Office of Personnel Management. The notice to ignore Musk reportedly came as a shocking reversal in the White House, which had been under the impression before the weekend that internal relations between Musk and the rest of Trump\u2019s senior staffers were improving after Musk had agreed to loop White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in on his plans, Reuters reported earlier this month. But Trump and Wiles did not sign off on the email, according to three sources that spoke on the condition of anonymity with the newswire, despite Musk\u2019s assurance during Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting that the president had given him the OK. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Reuters\u2019s sources were \u201cwrong,\u201d that Trump had signed off on the idea, that DOGE and OPM had given the White House advance notice of the email\u2019s release, and that the \u201cWhite House was not caught off guard.\u201d",

        "text": "Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez captured the mood of the moment in an interview this week with NPR. The New York congresswoman said that these days, government is working very well for the wealthy, while often failing ordinary people. \u201cEverything feels increasingly like a scam,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. \u201cNot only are grocery prices going up, but it\u2019s like everything has a fee and a surcharge. And I think that anger is put out at government.\u201d The congresswoman expressed her anger at the cuts to the federal government that President Trump and Elon Musk have been pursuing for the past month. \u201cI mean to the FAA? No. To the NIH? No,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually don\u2019t want someone taking a wrecking ball to someone\u2019s chemotherapy to just see what happens.\u201d She called out Trump administration officials for threatening to investigate her\u2014and specifically Tom Homan, President Trump\u2019s border czar, who said last week that Ocasio-Cortez was violating the law by trying \u201cto educate people how they evade law enforcement.\u201d \u201cI was informing all of my constituents of their constitutional protections and in particular, their constitutional protections against illegal search and seizure,\u201d she said, and had a question for the Justice Department: \u201cWell, there is a member of the Trump administration who is threatening and seeks to open an inquiry. And are you going to do it?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that she sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi after the interview, which said, \u201cI write to request clarity on whether the Department of Justice has yielded to political pressure and attempts to weaponize the agency against elected officials whose speech they disagree with.\u201d Donald Trump has now been brutally fact-checked by two different world leaders over his incessant whining about getting a payday from war-torn Ukraine. During a joint press conference Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump was once again complaining that the U.S. had been scammed into sending billions in military aid to Ukraine, while other nations were making their money back. \u201cWe wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had,\u201d Trump griped. \u201cYou know, they get their money back by giving money, we don\u2019t get the money back. Biden made a deal, he put in $350 billion, and I thought it was a very unfair situation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours,\u201d Starmer interjected. \u201cI mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given.\u201d Trump: They get their money back by giving money. We don't get the money back. I thought it was a very unfair situation.Starmer: We're not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. pic.twitter.com/oXuFZpZdu8 Starmer\u2019s correction was nearly identical to a fact-check from French President Emmanuel Macron\u00a0 during a press conference Monday, when he was also forced to push back against the grievance-addled U.S. president\u2019s false claims that Europe was simply \u201cloaning\u201d their money to Ukraine. \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank. We paid,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe paid 60 percent of the total effort, and it was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantee, grants, and we provided real money, to be clear.\u201d Macron had emphasized that Ukraine ought to be compensated by Russia for the deaths of citizens and destruction of property. Trump\u2019s obsession with getting paid back for America\u2019s supposedly humanitarian and military assistance has become a central feature of his efforts to resolve Russia\u2019s deadly invasion of Ukraine. Never mind how strange it is to demand payment for emergency aid in the first place. U.S. and Ukraine officials entered the final stages of a contentious mineral agreement, which would funnel half of the Eastern European nation\u2019s rare earth minerals\u2014hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of materials\u2014into the American market. The deal would serve to pay back some of what the U.S. spent but wouldn\u2019t do anything to ensure Ukraine\u2019s security or economic interests in the future. Trump has expressed hostility toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claiming he was enjoying the \u201cgravy train\u201d of U.S. aid and calling him a \u201cdictator.\u201d But on Thursday, Trump claimed he didn\u2019t remember saying that. The official social media account for the House Judiciary GOP rickrolled the Epstein files on Thursday. On the heels of a political stunt in which the Trump administration gifted large binders labeled \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase One\u201d to a cadre of MAGA influencers, Republicans in office suddenly decided it would be kosher to use the abhorrent sex trafficking case to make a quick joke. \u201c#BREAKING: EPSTEIN FILES RELEASED,\u201d the official X account for the House Judiciary GOP posted alongside a shortened URL that actually directed users to Rick Astley\u2019s music video for \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d The disgusting gimmick appalled users on the social media platform, some of whom were shocked that the Republican Party would risk the American public\u2019s cybersecurity by sending them down an unknown web address to access highly coveted, classified information. \u201cSending the American people to a tiny url that redirects to an unknown destination is a great way to ensure trust in the cybersecurity domain,\u201d posted one user. For years, Jeffrey Epstein orchestrated a child sex trafficking ring in which he raped countless young girls and helped his wealthy and famous affiliates do the same. He allegedly killed himself in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Earlier this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged to release the details of Epstein\u2019s flight logs as well as a list of his connections to the public by Thursday, though that still has not happened. \u201cThe \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 are something of a white whale for the QAnon wing of MAGA, as they believe that its release would reveal the villainous liberal cabal that secretly coordinates international child sex trafficking,\u201d wrote The New Republic\u2019s Malcolm Ferguson. \u201cMany in the conspiracy community believe that Epstein\u2019s death\u2014and the botched release of this list\u2014is part of a greater \u2018deep state\u2019 coverup.\u201d So the White House\u2019s gag earlier in the day, unsurprisingly, ruffled feathers on the far right. After some MAGA talking heads\u2014including DC Draino\u2019s Rogan O\u2019Handley, Libs of TikTok\u2019s Chaya Raichik, Liz Wheeler, and Mike Cernovich\u2014refused to share the contents of the binders after waltzing out of the executive office, others on the right were left screaming and scrambling online for actual details related to Epstein\u2019s activities. \u201cTHERE ARE NO EPSTEIN FILES!!!\u201d Laura Loomer claimed on X. \u201cTHE BINDERS ARE PROPS.

Administration officials are attempting to tout a $1 billion plan to combat the disease, as well as plans to import eggs from overseas. But that plan doesn\u2019t include bringing back fired avian flu workers, whom the USDA is struggling to rehire. The agency is running into logistical issues as well as skeptical ex-employees, some of whom aren\u2019t convinced they should return as Trump and Elon Musk continue to fire federal workers indiscriminately. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are going to want to come back,\u201d one anonymous USDA employee told Politico. \u201cNow there\u2019s this perception that federal jobs are not secure. I think they permanently damaged these services.\u201d USDA supervisors have also been told to justify every bird flu employee being rehired, and some employees who have come back still don\u2019t have laptop computers. It\u2019s not clear if all of the fired avian flu employees have been asked to come back, and some of the reinstated workers were even sent emails urging them to take the Trump administration\u2019s deferred resignation plan, according to two sources. \u201cRather than measure twice and cut once, it\u2019s more like everyone is on the chopping block and then, \u2018Oh shit we cut the wrong people,\u2019\u201d a USDA employee told Politico. This could be the first test of how the Trump administration handles a crisis with Musk wielding so much power within the government. Will Trump and Musk prioritize the need to combat the disease, prevent a potential pandemic, and safeguard the country? Or will they stubbornly continue to claim achievements while they gut crucial parts of the government? Elon Musk suddenly wants to increase the size of the federal workforce. \u201cThere is a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X Thursday. \u201cIf you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so.\u201d Musk\u2019s desperate call to bring retired federal employees back into the fray after single-handedly undermining the security of every single government job is inane on its face. It gets even more so when considering the actual requirements for the job. Individuals interested in becoming an air traffic controller must be younger than 31 years of age to apply for the position, according to the Federal Aviation Administration website. Air traffic controllers are permitted to serve in the position until they are 56 years old. So, it\u2019s immediately unclear how Musk\u2019s plan to lure retirees back would even be possible. Although the solution proposed by the unelected bureaucrat is decidedly unserious, the problem straining air traffic control towers is anything but. The New York Times reported in 2023 that nearly every air traffic control site in the country was understaffed, leading to the staffers in the high-stress position being overworked. After a deadly plane crash at the Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., earlier this month, the Times reported that its air traffic control tower had a staff of 19 controllers\u2014as opposed to the 30 recommended by the FAA and controllers\u2019 union. As of September 2024, the FAA had 14,000 air traffic controllers in its employ, having surpassed its yearly goal to bring aboard 1,800 new hires. The hiring spree was implemented to reverse a \u201cdecades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline,\u201d according to a post from the FAA. But earlier this month, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping layoffs, a whopping 400 FAA jobs were eliminated. According to the Trump administration, none of them were air traffic controllers. \u201cOn the layoffs, these were probationary employees\u2014meaning they had only been at the FAA for less than two years, represented less than 1 percent of FAA\u2019s more than 45,000 employees,\u201d said Department of Transportation spokesperson Halee Dobbins. Last month, Trump issued an executive order to \u201cimmediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring\u201d at the FAA, claiming that it \u201cprioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency.\u201d Elon Musk may be throwing his weight around the federal government, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet are happy about it. Trump\u2019s aides are reportedly struggling to contain internal administration disputes after Musk threatened mass layoffs over the weekend for federal employees who refused to submit a progress report to the Department of Government Efficiency, Reuters reported Thursday. Responding to the president\u2019s request that he become \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in sizing down the federal government, Musk wrote in a social media post Saturday that all federal employees must self-report five things that they achieved in the previous week before midnight on Monday, or else they would face immediate termination. Federal workers reportedly received an email from the Office of Personnel Management shortly afterward that echoed Musk\u2019s post. But by Monday, many federal agencies fronted by Trump\u2019s own appointees had simply told their staffers not to respond. Those included the Department of Defense, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the agency that issued the directive: the Office of Personnel Management. The notice to ignore Musk reportedly came as a shocking reversal in the White House, which had been under the impression before the weekend that internal relations between Musk and the rest of Trump\u2019s senior staffers were improving after Musk had agreed to loop White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in on his plans, Reuters reported earlier this month. But Trump and Wiles did not sign off on the email, according to three sources that spoke on the condition of anonymity with the newswire, despite Musk\u2019s assurance during Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting that the president had given him the OK. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Reuters\u2019s sources were \u201cwrong,\u201d that Trump had signed off on the idea, that DOGE and OPM had given the White House advance notice of the email\u2019s release, and that the \u201cWhite House was not caught off guard.\u201d Massive cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs that would have had devastating effects for veterans were paused late Wednesday. Lawmakers and veterans\u2019 organizations protested over concerns that the cuts would have hurt critical veterans\u2019 health services. On Tuesday, VA Secretary Doug Collins had bragged the department was merely slashing consulting deals to the tune of $2 billion. \u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins said in an X post Tuesday. In reality, the 875 contracts on the chopping block dealt with everything from assessing veterans\u2019 exposure to toxic materials to cancer treatment. On Wednesday, a VA spokesperson sought to backtrack, saying in a statement that its review of department contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d \u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in the statement. One of the targeted contracts had to do with reviewing veterans\u2019 disability ratings, a critical step needed for a veteran to qualify for medical coverage and draw medical compensation if they were injured due to their military service. If a veteran doesn\u2019t receive an accurate rating, they could end up getting worse financial support and treatment options. According to an internal VA email, one contracting official in the agency said that the Department of Government Efficiency said it was targeting \u201cconsulting\u201d contracts, but in reality, the cuts included chemotherapy and imaging services. Other contracts that would have been axed included radiation detection equipment, cancer care support, veterans\u2019 cemetery management, and the ability to assess toxic exposure. \u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360, told the AP. The organization advocates for veterans who suffer from respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure from trash-burning fires near military bases overseas. There\u2019s no guarantee that the planned cuts aren\u2019t suddenly resurrected. President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to slash what they call fraud, waste, and abuse from the federal government has largely been haphazard, resulting in multiple cases where they had to undo the firing of critical staff or the cancellation of lifesaving programs, such as some at the VA. In some cases, cuts haven\u2019t been reversed despite promises otherwise, and whether money is even being saved is debatable at best. The question is how many lives have been ruined by Musk and Trump just a month into this presidency.",

        "title": "Transcript: Trump Hit by Brutal Poll as Panicked GOPers Nix Town Halls | The New Republic",
        "text": "The following is a lightly edited transcript of the February 28 episode of The Daily Blast podcast. Listen to it here. Greg Sargent: This is The Daily Blast from The New Republic, produced and presented by the DSR network. I\u2019m your host, Greg Sargent. President Donald Trump is looking increasingly vulnerable on the very thing that helped him win the election: rising costs. On Thursday, Trump announced that his long planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go forward on March 4. Yet just a few hours later, a new poll hit, finding that 59 percent of Americans expect Trump\u2019s tariffs will drive up prices further. Only 31 percent say they\u2019ll be good for the economy. Meanwhile, on another front, Republicans are starting to cancel their town halls out of fear of voter blowback over Elon Musk\u2019s rampage through the federal government. Andrew Bates, who was a senior press secretary in President Biden\u2019s White House, has been arguing relentlessly that Trump and Republicans are heading into extremely rough waters on the economy, so today we\u2019re talking to him about how Democrats can capitalize. Thanks for coming on, Andrew. Andrew Bates: I appreciate you having me. Sargent: Let\u2019s start with this Bloomberg poll. Not only do 59 percent say Trump\u2019s tariffs will bring higher prices, 61 percent say food prices have increased in the last month. Only 38 percent think the economy is working for them. All this is echoed by a whole bunch of other polls and by worsening consumer sentiment metrics. It\u2019s worth pointing out, Andrew, that many economists agree with these majorities. They too say Trump\u2019s tariffs will lead to rising prices. Your reaction to all of it? Bates: Yeah, I think that he betrays the fundamental promise that he made to the country. I remember in the Republican National Convention speech, he told people on day one\u2014that\u2019s a direct quote\u2014prices will fall across the board. He also said that inflation would end immediately\u2014\u201cimmediately\u201d is also a direct quote. He was very explicit about this. And of course that was a false promise. Tariffs are a tax, and they are a tax that is disproportionately paid by people who are not wealthy, people that spend a greater percent of their income on daily necessities, food, clothing. And I think that what\u2019s especially telling about this is the revenue that they make from these tariff taxes\u2014the revenue they\u2019re taking in from middle-class folks who they said they were going to fight for\u2014they\u2019re turning around and they\u2019re using it to make room in the budget for tax giveaways to billionaires and big corporations. It\u2019s like a Bernie Madoff scheme. They are trying to take money out of the bank accounts of hardworking people after they got their votes promising lower cost, lower prices. Instead, they\u2019re actively raising prices that they said they were going to reduce, and taxing people for it, and they\u2019re pocketing that money. Sargent: It\u2019s a funny thing, Andrew. Trump is explicit on this point because he keeps saying the tariffs are going to bring in gangbusters revenue. Well, what do they need the revenue for? Bates: That\u2019s right. Because they\u2019re trying to add trillions to the deficit with tax giveaways for the wealthy. And you mentioned the DOGE cuts too. That also relates to this because while everybody is against waste\u2014myself, every Democrat I\u2019ve ever known\u2014a lot of what they\u2019re cutting is bone and not fat. For example, they fired people who have been in charge of fighting bird flu while egg prices are skyrocketing. They want to use the money that went to those salaries for tax cuts for the rich. And it\u2019s also true of the Medicaid cuts and the Affordable Care Act cuts they want to make. That is also to accommodate tax welfare for the richest people in the country, for Elon Musk and for Donald Trump themselves. It\u2019s just a total reverse of what they promised voters. Sargent: Well, speaking of Republicans being on their back feet right now, NBC News reports that House Republicans are backing off some of their town hall meetings. And here we see that it\u2019s because of Elon Musk, as you mentioned earlier, his DOGE cuts. Republicans have been getting absolutely hammered by constituents over the chaos and destruction that Musk has unleashed with all this. What do you make of the nature of this energy? Do you think it\u2019s too early to be confident that this will translate into something meaningful? Or alternatively, are there signs already that we\u2019re seeing something durable here, a level of dissatisfaction and backlash that could snowball and become something that matters in the midterms? Bates: I think people are feeling that the common denominator for everything they\u2019re doing is that working people, middle-class folks, people that they promise to fight for are being screwed over so that billionaires themselves, big corporations can see tax giveaways. And if people are feeling this in their daily lives, that\u2019s going to have an impact. And it also sets the impression. This is a country that takes people seriously. When they make an explicit promise on the campaign trail\u2014when they say that when it comes to your top priority, your daily costs, I promise you on day one you\u2019ll feel relief\u2014then not only does that not happen but [they] use [their] power to do the opposite so that [they] can make money off people\u2014he\u2019s going to benefit directly and so will Musk from the tax giveaways\u2014that all hits home for people. And their daily lives are being disrupted. That\u2019s not what they were sold. They were told their daily lives would improve. But if you look at some of the stuff they\u2019re classifying as waste, they\u2019re putting military families through hell. They also are getting rid of cancer research; I don\u2019t know a single American who thinks that that is waste. They are desperately trying to find the people that keep our nuclear arsenal secure because they fired them, and I don\u2019t know a single American who thinks that is a good idea. Everyone wants to get rid of waste, but I would argue it is exceedingly wasteful to put trillions of dollars on the country\u2019s credit card so people like Elon Musk can have lower taxes, which, by the way, exacerbates inflation. If you increase the deficit, it makes inflation worse. They told us they were going to end it. Sargent: I want to flag another number from the Bloomberg poll because I think it gets at your point very well. Only half of Republicans\u2014Republicans\u2014say they think the tariffs will be good for the economy. I think there\u2019s clearly a problem in Trump\u2019s base right now of some kind. There are a lot of signs coming out of the White House and Trumpworld that they\u2019re really working hard to juice up the base again. Something\u2019s wrong. All the talk about annexing Greenland and stealing the Panama Canal and so forth, for some reason, energizes Republican voters, so they\u2019re pushing that constantly. There\u2019s clearly among Republicans a bit of uncertainty about whether Trump really is delivering on the economy already. Can you talk a little bit about that? What do you think that means? Bates: Yeah, you mentioned energy. I think that there\u2019s a very real question about whether he has the energy to do the job. We all saw Elon Musk parading around in the cabinet meeting as though he was president. I saw this week [that] when Donald Trump was asked by a reporter about Musk\u2019s demand that federal employees justify their continuing to be on payroll, he didn\u2019t even seem to know about it. He said something like, Well, I guess they\u2019ll be fired if they don\u2019t do it right. You\u2019re the president, and you don\u2019t know? I think that he has been deferring to [Musk] so much. And he also has stopped talking about things like costs. As you\u2019re getting it, he\u2019s trying to talk about anything else, but it does seem like they\u2019ve lost the narrative and they\u2019re trying to get it back. And you just can\u2019t explain away if people are paying more money and feeling that pain and it\u2019s your fault. Sargent: It\u2019s extremely clear that there\u2019s an opportunity right now, I think, to fracture the MAGA coalition. As you mentioned earlier, Republicans are getting ready to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid right now. The Trump coalition this time around included a lot of lower propensity, lower engagement, working-class voters, but non-MAGA ones. Trump\u2019s own pollster recently found that 59 percent of voters in the 18 most competitive House districts are worried about their financial situation. And Trump\u2019s own pollster essentially gently told Republicans, You better prioritize the working class in these budget moves you\u2019re making in coming months. What do you want to see from Democrats in terms of driving this wedge among Republicans? How can Dems peel off those voters in advance in the midterms? What do you want to see them doing more of? Bates: I think that we need to remember that people\u2019s bottom line is virtually always going to be their highest priority, and that there is a pervasive and very real sense in the country that the tax code is already very unfairly weighted in favor of people that are wealthy. For some context, I led our press around when we were passing the Inflation Reduction Act in the White House, and I had expected Medicare negotiating lower drug costs to be the most popular element of the Inflation Reduction Act, but I was wrong. That was the second most popular. The first was that we were raising taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. Americans across ideological lines are very supportive of making the tax code fair, and they loathe tax giveaways to the rich. Like you were getting at, Trump\u2019s own pollster shows people hate that even more when it means that you\u2019re costing millions of folks their health care. Hospitals would close across the country, especially in rural areas, if they make Medicaid cuts on this scale\u2014and I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve reckoned with it. If that comes on the heels of I\u2019m promising you lower costs, I\u2019m raising them on you so that I can get a tax a tax benefit myself, I\u2019m also making your health care costs go up and causing mayhem in your community by closing hospitals because I also just want tax welfare for myself, that\u2019s just about the least popular set of things you could do. Sargent: You worked in the White House. What are you seeing coming out of there right now? Can you read between the lines, read the tea leaves a little bit? What do you think\u2019s going on internally? Are there debates inside about the stuff that we\u2019re talking about here? There have got to be people in there who know that this stuff is becoming a major problem for them. What\u2019s your reading? Bates: I think there are probably two things happening. One is, as you say, there are people who recognize they have a problem because consumer sentiment is falling. I would argue that\u2019s one of the most important kinds of polls that we have access to. It\u2019s what shows how Americans feel about the economy in general. And they\u2019re seeing that people took Donald Trump seriously when he said that right away costs would fall, and they\u2019re not feeling it; they\u2019re feeling the opposite. So there\u2019s some folks who probably recognize it. They are showing what they don\u2019t want to talk about. Which to your question about Democrats focus, that is something you should always keep in mind. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk about costs, if he doesn\u2019t want to talk about tax giveaways for the rich or health care or his tariff taxes, you should talk about those things. But there\u2019s probably another set at the White House that just feels like, They won and they get to do what they want. I\u2019ve been talking to folks who\u2019ve been trying to impress on some Republican members how hurtful Medicaid cuts would be in, say, my home state of North Carolina; and while there\u2019s some people in competitive districts who seem like they get it, there are a lot of these folks who seem a little drunk on the wind, like they\u2019re just going to do what they want. And that is a recipe for backlash. Again, the common thread of all these things is selling out the people they promised to fight for to the rich. You literally have the wealthiest man in the country, both in terms of literal money and in terms of incel energy, prancing around, looking like a moron, cutting the jobs of people that keep nukes safe, cutting the jobs of people that are fighting bird flu as egg prices go through the roof, putting military families through hell, and obviously the American people hate it. Sargent: There is a debate among Democrats right now over whether focusing on costs and kitchen table stuff is enough. A lot of the more moderate Democrats seem to want to do that, but there is a strong argument for taking on Trump and Musk and Republicans more forcefully over the nonstop law breaking, the profound unfitness of Trump\u2019s new cabinet figures, the havoc they\u2019re all unleashing by hacking away viciously at the federal government. Chris Murphy has been in that latter camp urging a more aggressive stance on some of that stuff. I think I agree with him. Where are you on all this? Bates: I think that the way that Trump is abusing the rule of law and dividing Americans against each other is disgusting, and I think that what we have to do is remember that we need to make a case to folks who may not feel that way off the bat. What we need to do is try to reach them. And that means listening to them about what their top priorities are. Most Americans\u2019 top priority is almost always going to be: How can I create a better financial future for my family? And there is a way that you can do that that also addresses a lot of these abuses for which there is a cost. But what we need to remember is there are a lot of parallels between now and 2017. I worked at the Democratic Super PAC American Bridge that cycle leading their House races arm; we took back the House, and it was because the American people hated the idea of costing millions their health care and driving up premiums so rich folks could get a tax cut. And of course, we were able to stop that, but we focused on it. We also focused on how his only legislative \u201caccomplishment\u201d was blowing up the deficit with tax welfare for rich people. We were disciplined. We did not take his bait. We were aware that if he was talking about something else, it\u2019s because he wanted us to. We stayed concentrated on what people thought should be front of mind for their leaders: their costs, their bottom line. And that builds a credibility that will then get them to take you seriously about some of these other threats. And there are profound costs to corruption. A good example of this is Trump likes to talk a big game about China, but he has been consistently outfoxed by them. I remember he claimed he got a great trade deal with China during his first term; they didn\u2019t meet any of the American export targets that he promised the country would happen. This was not long before he promised people Covid was not a serious threat because Xi had promised him that it was under control, which was, of course, horseshit; the guy he said that he bonded with over a beautiful slice of chocolate cake. If you look at USAID, that helps China. That hurts our economy and it helps China because we are locked in a global competition with China to see who can get better access, better economic relationships with just about every other country out there. USAID is one of the main ways that we counter their Belt and Road Initiative. And there are ways when that comes up that we can make clear for people that that actually hurts your interests, but what we have to lead with is, I know that you\u2019re feeling these costs, I am too. We were all promised that they would fall on day one, but what are they doing instead? They are using full control of Washington to raise your costs, to take your health care\u2014all so Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their rich friends can see a tax windfall. And that opens the door. Sargent: I think there\u2019s no question that people really don\u2019t remember how important the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which were an enormous giveaway to corporations and the rich, were in the midterms. Can you just get at that a little bit? People usually seem to think that it was just anti-Trump energy. And by the way, it really was. There was a lot of anti Trump organizing on the ground, and there was a lot of angst about the Muslim ban, about immigration and that sort of thing. But the tax cut was a big part of the 2018 House Democratic win, wasn\u2019t it? Bates: Yes, it was central to it. And what we have to remember is energy, if it\u2019s channeled correctly, can be very powerful; but if energy is not informed by strategy, it is not going to bear fruit. So we have to make sure that we\u2019re using our energy in a constructive way. That means talking to the folks who might be skeptical now, but who, as they feel this economic pain that\u2019s being inflicted on them, as Republicans force onto the country this radical redistribution of wealth from hardworking people to billionaires, to big corporations, that is eye opening, can see you in a new light. Democrats need to remember that midterms are usually defined by the agenda of the incumbent president and their party. That doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t talk about your own, but it means that that is what opens the conversation. That\u2019s what people are reacting to. You need to use that foil, identify what it is that repulses people most\u2014and obviously it\u2019s that their costs are going up so rich people can get a tax cut\u2014and then show that you are the alternative to it, that you think there should be a fair tax code for hardworking people. This is not a country that appreciates the values of Bernie Madoff, but that is exactly what you have in the White House right now. You have two billionaires who promised people that they were going to get relief from global inflation but they are raising the costs themselves, charging you so that they can cut their own taxes. And while they\u2019re at it, they\u2019re also taking your health care away and raising health care costs and shuttering rural hospitals and costing us manufacturing\u2014all so they can profit off of you. They promise people new access to the American dream, but they\u2019re really just taking money out of your bank account and putting it into their own. That\u2019s the thing that disgusts people. Sargent: I do think Democrats are going to have a very strong case to make. I just hope that they keep their own people energized as well. I agree with you that there\u2019s a way to bridge the two. Andrew Bates, thanks so much for coming on with us, man. It\u2019s really good to talk to you. Bates: Thank you for having me.

        "title": "Alex Karp\u2019s War for the West | The New Republic",
        "text": "Ever since Donald Trump\u2019s reelection victory last November, Alex Karp has occupied the seemingly contradictory position of being a vocal supporter of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris taking a very public victory lap. Palantir, the data-mining and defense technology company Karp co-founded with Peter Thiel in the early years of the war on terror, was booming, its market capitalization riding the market\u2019s delirious excitement over artificial intelligence to leapfrog those of the traditional, or \u201cprime,\u201d defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. \u201cA juggernaut is emerging,\u201d a triumphant Karp had crowed to investors on the eve of the election. \u201cThis is the software century, and we intend to take the entire market.\u201d In early December, just as The New York Times reported that Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition offices had been \u201ccrawling\u201d with representatives from defense tech firms like Palantir, Karp was in Southern California for the Reagan National Defense Forum. Traditionally a fusty opportunity for the Pentagon brass to rub epaulets with the primes, this year, the Palantir-sponsored event at the Gipper\u2019s presidential library and museum in Simi Valley was \u201cswarmed\u201d by Silicon Valley defense tech executives hawking drones, \u201canti-drone drones,\u201d and advanced software systems. In widely clipped comments that earned a coveted monosyllabic endorsement from Elon Musk, Karp described Palantir\u2019s core mission: Americans are the most loving God-fearing, fair, least discriminatory people on the planet. And they want to know that if you\u2019re waking up and thinking about harming American citizens or if American citizens are taken hostage and kept in dungeons, or if you\u2019re a foreign power sending fentanyl to poison our people, something really bad is going to happen to you and your friends and your cousins and your bank account and your mistress and whoever was involved. The performance was Karp distilled: using a buttoned-up, legacy media\u2013moderated panel as a platform for a made-to-go-viral paean to American greatness in the form of a call for collective punishment. Since Palantir went public in 2020, Karp, even more than Musk, has turned himself into the consummate Silicon Valley aristo-populist: palatable enough to C-suite mores to grace the stage at Davos and the pages of the business press (The Economist named him its \u201cBest CEO of 2024\u201d), but sufficiently \u201cbased\u201d to become a cult figure in the seedier precincts of X and Reddit, where retail investor \u201cPalantirians\u201d trade AI-generated memes of \u201cDaddy Karp\u201d as a glowering Roman gladiator or toga-clad philosopher-king. This month, Karp is out with a much-anticipated book co-authored with his head of corporate affairs, Nicholas W. Zamiska. The Technological Republic attempts to distill the argument Karp has been making for years: that, since the country\u2019s tech scene is historically a product of the national security state, Silicon Valley executives and engineers should shed their compunctions about working with the military and dedicate themselves to ensuring another century of American hard-power supremacy. It\u2019s an argument with a growing audience. Thanks to a mix of factors\u2014a massive increase in venture capital investment in defense and a slowdown in broader venture activity; new Pentagon initiatives designed to bridge the fabled \u201cValley of Death\u201d between tech companies and the Pentagon; a tech workforce cowed by layoffs and firings\u2014the era of Silicon Valley walkouts, open letters, public employee protests, and genuflecting CEOs is, for now at least, mostly over. Now, Karp\u2019s ascendant faction of the tech ownership class is storming the citadels of American power. At his confirmation hearing, Pete Hegseth praised Silicon Valley for showing \u201ca willingness, a desire, and capability to bring its best technologies to bear at the Pentagon\u201d for the first time \u201cin generations.\u201d JD Vance, famously a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Peter Thiel\u2014and, in his past life as a venture capitalist, a defense tech investor\u2014has already spoken about cracking open the primes\u2019 stranglehold on the Pentagon\u2019s $880 billion annual budget. Thiel and Musk\u2019s fellow \u201cPayPal Mafia\u201d member David Sacks, a Palantir investor, is Trump\u2019s crypto and AI czar. Karp\u2019s senior adviser (and the husband of another PayPal Mafia member) is now Trump\u2019s top economics diplomat. The new federal chief information officer overseeing all of government I.T. is a Palantir alum. And Musk\u2014America\u2019s richest defense contractor, thanks to his ownership of SpaceX\u2014is calling for Pentagon weapons programs to be \u201ccompletely redone.\u201d Karp isn\u2019t afraid of the implication that his intellectual interventions might serve a business purpose. At the inaugural Palantir-sponsored AI Expo for National Competitiveness last spring, he warned the Pentagon and industry grandees in attendance that \u201cif we lose the intellectual battle, you will not be able to deploy any army in the West, ever.\u201d But if The Technological Republic is Karp\u2019s contribution to the battle of ideas for Western civilization, it amounts to little more than a gussied-up exercise in industry P.R. What really makes America great, the book claims, is not so much its system of government, nor its vaunted ideals and values, but its software industry. And, wouldn\u2019t you know it: The most important software companies are the ones whose products, as Karp has put it, \u201cpower the West to its obvious, innate superiority\u201d and \u201cbring violence and death to our enemies.\u201d In early February, when Palantir\u2019s better-than-expected earnings report shot its stock price to another record high, Karp ended his letter to shareholders by quoting Clash of Civilizations theorist Samuel Huntington. \u201cThe rise of the West,\u201d Karp wrote, \u201cwas not made possible \u2018by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion \u2026 but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence.\u2019\u201d He continued, still quoting Huntington: \u201cWesterners often forget this fact; non-Westerners never do.\u201d Karp and Zamiska\u2019s basic historical claim that Silicon Valley owes its modern origins to Cold War defense spending is broadly true, even if the ethical mandate they derive from it\u2014making the U.S. armed forces more lethal in order to uphold American global supremacy\u2014is question-begging. Still, at times, their critique of the post\u2013Cold War commercialization of Silicon Valley is surprisingly lacerating: \u201cFar too much capital, intellectual and otherwise, has been dedicated to sating the often capricious and passing needs of late capitalism\u2019s hordes,\u201d they write, decrying a generation of software engineers for applying its prodigious talents to building the next food delivery or social media app. But their critique of tech-enabled consumerism only goes so far. In one of the book\u2019s many unintentionally funny moments, they single out the early retail website eToys, a darling of pre-dot-com-bubble Silicon Valley, and castigate it for the \u201cshallowness\u201d of its ambition and \u201cabdication of everything beyond the light hedonism of the moment.\u201d But they\u2019re quick to clarify: \u201cTo desire, even a toy, is to be human.\u201d The point of refashioning the government in the image of a Silicon Valley start-up, they write elsewhere, is to ensure it delivers \u201cthe goods and services that are essential to our lives.\u201d How did we get from \u201clate capitalism\u2019s hordes\u201d to \u201cgoods and services\u201d? It helps to remember that Palantir also runs a commercial business accounting for nearly half of its revenue, with a client list that has included the likes of Hershey\u2019s, Coca-Cola, Hertz, Molson-Coors, and Tyson Foods. Perhaps the superiority of the West also depends on having bags of Any\u2019tizers\u00ae Crispy Boneless Chicken Bites delivered through advanced trucking logistics. This tonal seesawing\u2014for every Karpian truth-bomb, a lawyerly qualification; for each saber rattled, a pitch-deck clich\u00e9\u2014is symptomatic of this book\u2019s generic incoherence. Karp and Zamiska describe The Technological Republic as existing in the \u201cinterstitial but we hope to think rich space between political, business, and academic treatise.\u201d That\u2019s one way of putting it. Another is that it reads as though you asked an AI chatbot to write a set of Gladwellian think pieces in defense of American techno-militarism, with as many smart-sounding yet ultimately vacuous quotes as possible. The Technological Republic reads as though you asked an AI chatbot to write a set of Gladwellian think pieces in defense of American techno-militarism, with as many smart-sounding yet ultimately vacuous quotes as possible. Despite clocking in at just 320 pages\u2014almost a third of which is taken up by notes, a bibliography, and an index\u2014the book is bloated by potted anecdotes that begin in the style of a New Yorker essay (\u201cOn June 26, 1951, at around 1:30 p.m., a cluster of honeybees began to form in a park in Munich, Germany \u2026\u201d). Bibliographically, it offers a dizzying bricolage. On one page, the late anarchist David Graeber; on another, the frothing reactionary Roger Kimball. Here the Cold War liberal Anne Applebaum, insisting on the need for rules and muscle to enforce the liberal order; there the neoconservative don Irving Kristol, extolling the importance of reviving old \u201creligious orthodoxies.\u201d This is the sort of book where the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner\u2019s The Tears of the White Man, a 1983 polemic against Western guilt for the Third World, is invoked to bash Google\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d corporate motto. Is this evidence of Karp\u2019s synthetic brilliance, of a \u201cmad composer picking big ideas out of the ether,\u201d as the Financial Times once described his vibe? I\u2019m not so convinced. Much of the book\u2019s citational extravagance amounts to Karp and Zamiska rummaging through their library to prettify an otherwise banal point. In a section on the secrets to Palantir\u2019s business success, for example, Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s counsel to \u201cleave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee\u201d propels Karp and Zamiska to the observation that they \u201ccount ourselves among those who have repeatedly fled, abandoning failed projects within days of a lack of progress being surfaced and deconstructing dysfunctional teams.\u201d Deconstructing dysfunctional teams! Reading those lines, I envisioned the soil around a certain Concord, Massachusetts, graveyard plot churning in anguish. If there is a single pattern of thought that defines The Technological Republic, it is that of a wavering liberal, hair-splitting his way toward civilizational chauvinism. Karp and Zamiska admit that Huntington\u2019s division of the world into separate civilizations (\u201cWestern, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African\u201d) was \u201ccertainly reductionist.\u201d But isn\u2019t it a shame, they complain, that we can no longer \u201chave serious normative discussions\u201d about which cultures are superior to others? They offer a similar assessment of the \u201cunapologetically aristocratic\u201d 1969 British television series Civilisation, in which the art historian Kenneth Clark elevated the \u201cHellenistic\u201d over the \u201cNegro\u201d imagination. \u201cAnachronistic,\u201d goes their clipped critique, \u201cbut is there nothing in our aesthetic lives, no sense of north or south, that ought to be retained?\u201d Karp and Zamiska take an analogous approach to defending Palantir\u2019s work. They nod to the concerns of AI ethicists with the drive-by admission that the \u201cpotential integration of weapons systems with increasingly autonomous AI software necessarily brings risks.\u201d But those concerns quickly become even more reason to smash the guardrails: \u201cA weapons system in the hands of an ethical society\u201d like the United States, they write, will deter adversaries only if \u201cit is far more powerful\u201d than anything an enemy can muster. Describing the U.S.-China AI race as an \u201cOppenheimer moment,\u201d they cite Albert Einstein\u2019s 1939 letter to FDR calling for, \u201cif necessary, swift action\u201d to build the atomic bomb. They neglect to mention that Einstein later called his letter to Roosevelt the \u201cone great mistake in my life.\u201d On the domestic front, Karp and Zamiska are just as evasive. Raising the specter of the scene from Orwell\u2019s 1984 in which Winston Smith wanders through the woods, imagining a microphone hidden in the trees, they come to the conclusion that such a future \u201cmay be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants.\u2026 It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame.\u201d For what, you might ask? For \u201cthe speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors.\u201d (Karp and Zamiska may have in mind the wave of protests in 2018 and 2019 over Palantir\u2019s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.) In other words: The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our tech capitalist leviathans, but in ourselves, that we do cancel culture. And for all Karp and Zamiska\u2019s self-styling as critics of Silicon Valley, much of the book is dedicated to proclaiming the tech industry\u2019s salvific qualities. Only a \u201cunion of the state and the software industry,\u201d they claim, will maintain American dominance in this century, and this techno-governmental fusion will require the state to adopt the \u201cengineering mindset\u201d that has fueled Silicon Valley\u2019s world-bestriding success. Karp and Zamiska blandly describe this mindset as involving a \u201cdisinterest in theater and posturing,\u201d an \u201cabandonment of grand theories about how the world ought to be,\u201d and, via a quote from the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, a resistance to \u201csweeping and easy generalizations.\u201d Aside from being meaningless abstractions, each of these qualities is betrayed practically every time Karp gets in front of a camera and utters the words \u201cAmerica\u201d or \u201cthe West.\u201d It\u2019s hard to picture him acting otherwise. Mythmaking, bluster, and hype are practically job requirements for the CEOs of the defense tech world. Justifying ever-frothier valuations\u2014as of mid-February, Palantir\u2019s market capitalization was worth about half that of the five traditional defense primes combined, despite it reporting barely 1 percent of their combined revenue last year\u2014requires telling a convincing story about a future world in which your product is the deus ex machina for the potential problems you claim are impending inevitabilities. For Karp and Co., this means boldly announcing that the United States is already in a \u201chot Cold War\u201d against China; forecasting an impending three-theater conflict with Sino, Russo, and Perso fronts; arguing that autonomous weaponry will soon eclipse the atom bomb in geostrategic importance; and claiming that U.S. superiority in militarized AI will usher in a new Pax Americana. This is the future we are rushing toward: one where a $200 billion tech company enacts violence in the name of Western civilization while waxing poetic about how building lethal software is just like making great art. Given these grand pronouncements, it is clarifying to discover that the section of the book that actually describes the virtues of Palantir\u2019s \u201corganizational culture\u201d is laughably prosaic. Palantir employees, Karp and Zamiska say, are encouraged to apply the lessons of a book on improvisational theater to their work, and to digest the insights of the philosopher Isaiah Berlin\u2019s 1953 book on \u201cfoxes and hedgehogs.\u201d These supposedly sui generis workplace policies are barely more sophisticated than the standard nostrums of the business press. (\u201cWhat Startups Can Learn From Improv Comedy,\u201d advises The Wall Street Journal; \u201cMature Entrepreneurs Know When to Be a Hedgehog and When to Be Fox,\u201d counsels Forbes.) Striking one of the book\u2019s many bathetic notes, Karp and Zamiska write that the best start-ups operate like \u201cartist colonies, filled with temperamental and talented souls,\u201d where status is fluid and nonconformity encouraged. The upshot of this unique structure? \u201cThe benefit of it being somewhat unclear or ambiguous who is leading commercial sales in Scandinavia, for example, is that maybe that someone should be you. Or what about outreach to state and local governments in the American Midwest?\u201d This, apparently, is the future we are rushing toward: one where a $200 billion tech company enacts violence in the name of Western civilization while waxing poetic about how building lethal software is just like making great art. Toward the end of the book, Karp and Zamiska pause to linger on an episode that briefly shook the German cultural world of the late 1990s. In a speech accepting a major literary award, the eminent German novelist Martin Walser criticized Germany\u2019s culture of Holocaust remembrance. It was a \u201cmoral cudgel,\u201d he argued, wielded by the liberal intelligentsia to repress a newly united Germany\u2019s nationalistic revival. Referring to plans to build the Berlin Holocaust memorial, Walser invoked Hannah Arendt: \u201cProbably there is a banality of the good, too,\u201d he said. What Karp and Zamiska don\u2019t mention in their recounting of this episode is that Karp was a doctoral student at Goethe University in Frankfurt at the time, and that he made the controversy the central case study of his dissertation. As the Harvard professor Moira Weigel noted in a fascinating exegesis of the document, which has yet to be officially translated into English, Karp\u2019s thesis examined how certain speech patterns allow for the expression of taboo wishes, especially those produced by human drives toward aggression. Walser\u2019s speech, Karp argued, performed such a function. By letting his audience express their taboo desire to throw off the yoke of public Holocaust remembrance, he wrote, Walser convinced them that \u201cthese taboos should never have existed.\u201d A quarter-century and billions of dollars of military contracts later, the story acquires a slightly different inflection. Karp and Zamiska acknowledge that Walser\u2019s speech articulated \u201cthe forbidden desires and feelings of a nation, and in doing so relieved an immense amount of internal dissonance for his audience,\u201d but they seem to treat this as an example to follow. The Technological Republic, to say nothing of Karp\u2019s own public speechifying, is a work that invites the kind of analysis Karp once applied to Walser. What else to make of the book\u2019s whiny bombast, its apparent delight in contradiction and provocation, its air of imperious, impetuous authority? Of its ritual invocations of American and Western superiority, its apparent desire to discard our sympathy for history\u2019s victims? \u201cThe victors of history have a habit of growing complacent at precisely the wrong moment,\u201d they write. \u201cWhile it is currently fashionable to claim that the strength of our ideas and ideals in the West will inevitably lead to triumph over our adversaries, there are times when resistance, even armed resistance, must precede discourse.\u201d In her piece on Karp\u2019s dissertation, Weigel observed that his adviser, the German social psychologist Karola Brede, considered Walser\u2019s speech\u2014which she interpreted as taking the side of Germany\u2019s antisemites, even as Walser avoided explicitly antisemitic language\u2014as an effort to flatter his audience \u201cinto thinking that they were taking part in a daring intellectual exercise, while in fact activating anti-intellectual feelings.\u201d I can think of few better ways to describe this book.

        "title": "Medicaid Isn\u2019t the Only Popular, Lifesaving Program the GOP Will Cut | The New Republic",
        "text": "The budget blueprint that congressional Republicans passed this week outlines a massive wealth transfer to the rich\u2014at the expense of everyone else. While millionaires and billionaires will get $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts, the Energy and Commerce Committee, for instance\u2014which oversees Medicaid\u2014is supposed to find $880 billion to cut from government spending. As the GOP details precisely what it intends to cut over the coming weeks, it\u2019s likely those proposals will put lifesaving health care for 79 million Americans at risk. Trump didn\u2019t run on a broad-based austerity agenda to dismantle essential government services, put hundreds of thousands of people out of work, endanger millions of lives, and illegally seize power for himself so as to enrich the wealthy. But that\u2019s the agenda his administration seems hell-bent on delivering. Perhaps it seemed like a given that the GOP would make gutting climate funding and regulations on polluters a central part of this crusade. Or perhaps, compared to the devastating cuts to landmark social programs that seem all but certain given the size of the top-line budget being proposed, getting rid of subsidies for electric vehicles and solar panels might seem like window dressing. Democratic opposition to GOP budget plans have understandably emphasized defending landmark social programs instead of smaller environmental and green energy initiatives: During a press conference Thursday morning, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stood next to a sign saying \u201cSave Medicaid\u201d and reiterated his party\u2019s stance in budget negotiations: \u201cHands off Social Security. Hands of Medicaid. Hands off Medicare.\u201d What about everything else, though? It makes sense, of course, for Democrats to focus their messaging around programs that impact the lives of millions of people every single day. But climate and environmental programs also affect millions of people every day. The reason people seem to have forgotten that is that, over the last four years, Democrats leaned into talking about climate change and green energy primarily as a business and/or geopolitical opportunity. Subsidies for clean energy products and manufacturing would revitalize the American middle class and allow the United States to outcompete China in key twenty-first-century growth industries like E.V.s, top Biden aides insisted. With a little coaxing, the private sector would lead the way: Roughly two-thirds of the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s climate and clean energy\u2013related funding accrued to corporations. The pitfalls of this shortsighted messaging were already apparent when Democrats struggled to campaign on it in the last election. They\u2019re being highlighted again now as IRA funds are targeted for elimination: Thanks in part to the IRA\u2019s top-down approach, most Americans still haven\u2019t heard much about it; 40 percent of registered voters don\u2019t even know it exists. Although the vast majority of private investment spurred on by the IRA flowed to congressional districts controlled by Republicans, outside of a few small pockets of discontent, this hasn\u2019t stopped the party from trying to claw back those same funds. (Why would it? Cuts to Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare will hurt plenty of Republicans; they\u2019re in the GOP\u2019s crosshairs all the same.) Republicans now seem poised to frame their gargantuan Energy and Commerce cuts as an attack on supposedly wasteful climate spending that much of the country didn\u2019t realize was happening, redirecting attention away from wildly unpopular cuts to Medicaid. The point here isn\u2019t to cry over the milk spilled by Bidenomics\u2019 strategic failures. But Democrats and climate advocates should avoid repeating the same mistakes. Climate and environmental programs aren\u2019t luxury add-ons to embrace when times are good. Instead, they\u2019re essential tenets of a modern state that help prevent death and immiseration\u2014and they help make people\u2019s lives better and cheaper in the meantime. Helping U.S. companies compete in green export markets is all well and good, but it\u2019s not the main reason to support climate policy. Preventing death is. The power-plant pollution regulations the Trump administration wants to eliminate were expected to prevent up to 1,200 premature deaths a year from respiratory disease, heart disease, and more by 2035. Trump is also going after California\u2019s clean car rules, projected to prevent 1,000 premature deaths by 2040. In the U.S. overall, 350,000 premature deaths per year are attributable to fossil fuel pollution. Republican policies to expand fossil fuel production and tear up regulations\u2014including a plan to slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget by 65 percent\u2014would mean that even more people die. Dismantling Biden-era regulations on lead and PFAS will leave millions with toxic drinking water, contaminated with substances that contribute to cognitive impairment, asthma, and premature deaths from heart disease and cancer. Gutting the already understaffed, overworked U.S. Forest Service will starve efforts to reduce wildfire risk and leave fewer staff on hand to respond to flames fanned by rising temperatures, deepening a home insurance crisis that is already making homeownership and rent unaffordable in Florida, California, and several other states. The list goes on. Important as it is to protect Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, the fact that Democrats\u2019 most popular, defensible programs are at least 60 years old doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in their ability to govern in the future. Since 2016, the party\u2019s main case for itself has been that it could prevent another Trump administration, restore norms, and return the country to a slightly greener version of a happier, quieter past. That failed, and Democratic leadership is once again relegated to defending programs enacted by its more ambitious and imaginative predecessors. The right has always been better at fighting for the past, though. The essentially conservative position that Democrats and progressives alike have adopted over the last several decades\u2014to defend and expand on the gains of the New Deal and the Great Society\u2014is a bad fit both to build a governing majority and for an era where the climate crisis is changing the country in permanent, unpredictable ways. Fights over federal spending are showcasing a Republican Party that\u2019s more revolutionary than conservative, trampling over constitutional checks and balances in order to concentrate ever more wealth and power in the hands of a tiny minority. Trump was elected on the promise of change, but the administration mostly articulates its vision of a MAGA-fied future in the sorts of vague, brain-dead language that crypto scammers use to sucker people into buying shitcoins. Democrats should take this opportunity to spell out what that future would actually mean: millions of people dying of preventable illnesses because they don\u2019t have health insurance; family homes burned to the ground and replaced by luxury developments that foreign investors buy up to avoid paying taxes; parents kicked off Social Security and out of their homes, forced to move in with their children who are working two or three jobs just to afford their insurance premiums; kids who grow up with rare and debilitating diseases\u2014if they don\u2019t die of measles first\u2014thanks to the toxins in their water, whose schools can\u2019t support them because the richest man in the world ransacked the Department of Education. The world Trump and Musk want is hellish. But in order to persuade voters of that, and persuade them to kick this pair out of power, Democrats need to be able to promise a better one\u2014not just more of the same.

        "title": "Why I\u2019m Not Joining the Economic Blackout Day | The New Republic",
        "text": "There\u2019s an \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d scheduled for Friday, February 28. This is a resistance-minded effort to give ordinary people a chance to strike a blow against\u2014well, take your pick, really. I\u2019m as concerned about the state of the nation as anybody. But I won\u2019t be participating in this day of buying nothing. Let me explain why. A nonprofit called People\u2019s Union USA, which describes itself as committed to \u201ceconomic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform,\u201d organized the economic blackout. Participation is simple: You don\u2019t spend any money for 24 hours, except maybe at a local business. Going 24 hours without spending money is no hardship; I do it all the time. And government accountability and corporate reform are high on my list of priorities. But I like to know what I\u2019m boycotting, and People\u2019s Union USA doesn\u2019t really answer that question. I\u2019m especially put off by this: Are you against Trump, Elon Musk, or any specific individuals? This movement is not about one person. It is about the system as a whole. Both political parties, both past and current leaders, and billionaires have manipulated the economy and profited off the working class. We will hold them all accountable. Our focus is systemic change, not political drama. You want me to boycott \u201cthe system as a whole\u201d? Do you mean capitalism? I don\u2019t want to bring down capitalism; I just want to make it behave. There are people (Jeff Bezos appears to be one) who think it\u2019s anti-capitalist to favor (as I do) more regulation, higher taxes on the rich, stronger labor unions, a more generous welfare state, and a larger government presence in the economy. Bezos may think believing these things means I oppose the free market, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m just a New Deal liberal trying, like Franklin Roosevelt, to keep capitalism from destroying itself and taking the rest of us down with it. People\u2019s Union USA\u2019s sneering reference to \u201cpolitical drama\u201d is my biggest problem with this boycott. Aside from making no logical sense (surely a movement that wants the entire country to engage in protest intends that protest to create political drama), that phrase commits the same sin of bothsidesism of which the mainstream media frequently stands accused. Why is it wrong for The New York Times to be evenhanded (its mission is to report news \u201cwithout fear or favor\u201d) but OK for People\u2019s Union USA? I\u2019m a partisan for the Democratic Party\u2014not because it\u2019s perfect, but rather because it\u2019s the only major party that\u2019s remotely sane. I\u2019m in no mood to hear it even hinted that, as George Wallace famously put it in 1968, there ain\u2019t a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Democrats and Republicans. There\u2019s a billion-dollar difference. The GOP has completely lost its mind. We\u2019re in an emergency, but the emergency isn\u2019t that \u201cthe system as a whole\u201d is unsatisfactory in some ill-defined way. The emergency is that Donald Trump is president, and he\u2019s trying to turn this country into a dictatorship. Let\u2019s focus on that. As they said in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, \u201cKeep your eyes on the prize.\u201d The prize in this instance is preserving the rule of law, which Trump defies at every turn. The civil rights movement, Thomas E. Ricks argues in his excellent book Waging a Good War, was plotted with the precision of a military campaign. We need to apply that same military-style discipline to fighting Trump. People\u2019s Union USA acknowledges in a backhanded way that Trump is the problem by making the boycott partly about diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs. These are in eclipse largely because Trump and his fellow Republicans are bullying corporations to drop them. But boycotting all of corporate America doesn\u2019t work here, because not all of corporate America has abandoned DEI. Apple, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Costco, Delta Airlines, and Microsoft are all standing by their DEI programs. To whatever extent this protest is about DEI, punishing good actors (on this issue, anyway) along with bad ones defeats the purpose. It may be argued that the February 28 blackout is intended just as a shot across the bow, a sort of digital general strike to alert bad actors that consumers are organizing to resist them. And indeed, People\u2019s Union USA plans future one-week boycotts against individual corporations, for various specified reasons. But kicking these off with an Everybody Boycott invites critics to write the movement off as a woolly-headed protest against \u201cthe system as a whole,\u201d like the Yippies trying to levitate the Pentagon in 1967. As for the future individual boycotts, I wish People\u2019s Union USA would spell out in greater detail, with links to reputable sources, their purpose. An Amazon boycott planned for March 7\u201314 requires little explanation, but before I boycott General Mills I\u2019d like to know more about \u201cfood industry corruption and the poisoning of our families.\u201d Even these more targeted boycotts are ill timed, because they take us away from the emergency of the moment, which is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. What can we do to fight that? Plenty. Start by reading a web page from the nonprofit Choose Democracy, titled, helpfully, \u201cWhat can I do to fight this coup?\u201d The nonprofit Indivisible\u2019s \u201cPractical Guide to Democracy on the Brink\u201d is also quite useful. Boycotts can play a role in Trump Resistance 2.0, but let\u2019s boycott the right targets. People have lately been picketing Tesla dealerships to pressure Elon Musk to get the hell out of the White House. Good idea\u2014keep it going! I\u2019ve previously urged New Republic readers (and The New Republic itself) to get the hell off Twitter. (TNR, I\u2019m sorry to report, ignored me.) Advertiser boycotts of Twitter should expand. I\u2019ll have more to say going forward on how to mobilize against Trump\u2019s corruption, his illegal actions, and his abuse of power. This isn\u2019t how. If you really, really want to join the February 28 blackout, I guess go ahead, because it\u2019s basically harmless\u2014but that\u2019s the problem. The Trump opposition needs to impose pain at carefully chosen leverage points. It needs (in a nonviolent sense) to do harm.

        "text": "There is no way to overstate what is happening in America. A sinister alliance between a demagogue, the world\u2019s richest man, and right-wing activists is rapidly remaking the federal government by destroying everything it can. Entire agencies are being eliminated. Tens of thousands of civil service employees have been fired, and that\u2019s only a fraction of the initial 220,000 workers in Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s crosshairs. Nowhere in the government is safe, it seems, and each day brings a new wave of shocking cuts. This blitzkrieg is reason enough for every American to be alarmed about the direction of their country. And yet, it is hardly the whole story of the damage being wrought by the Trump administration. The overriding focus on the transformation of the federal government is understandable, but it often overlooks the human cost of these moves. One cannot put a figure on this unfolding tragedy. Lives are being destroyed\u2014indeed, lost\u2014already. And it makes clear that this administration is guided by cruelty above all else: To inflict pain and suffering on as many people as possible, as soon as possible. On February 18, two young girls who were effectively imprisoned in a hotel in Panama held a sign on a window reading, \u201cPlease help us.\u201d They were among hundreds of Asian migrants who were deported to the Central American country after being told they were flying to Texas. Shortly thereafter, a group of 97 migrants being held in the Panama hotel were moved to a camp in the jungle where conditions are even worse. \u201cIt looks like a zoo, there are fenced cages,\u201d one 27-year-old migrant from Iran told The New York Times. \u201cThey gave us a stale piece of bread. We are sitting on the floor.\u201d Other migrants have been sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, which is being fashioned into a concentration camp. Some have already attempted suicide, while others have threatened it, according to three former detainees at the prison. The Trump administration has insisted that many deportees are violent criminals but has provided little, and in many cases no, evidence that this is true. Indeed, investigations into some migrants sent to Guant\u00e1namo have found no criminal records whatsoever. The young girls begging for help in Panama certainly aren\u2019t gang members. Instead, they are part of a sadistic public relations effort: The Trump administration is holding refugees, migrants, and others in inhumane, and possibly deadly, conditions in an effort to warn others from trying to come to a nation founded by immigrants. On a moral level, the closure of the U.S. Agency for International Development is an abandonment: The United States had promised to help people suffering from disease and, in some cases, conditions that were caused by Americans. And now the agency\u2019s elimination is certain to cause devastation around the world. In Vietnam, medical care has abruptly ceased for those suffering from the effects of Agent Orange\u2014the horrific chemical used by soldiers during the Vietnam War\u2014as has support for children born with serious birth defects, likely due to their parents\u2019 exposure to the chemical. \u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d Nguyen Thi Ngoc Diem, who was born with a malformed spine, told The New York Times. \u201cAgent Orange came from the U.S.\u2014it was used here, and that makes us victims,\u201d she said. \u201cA little support for people like us means a lot, but at the same time, it\u2019s the U.S.\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands in Africa have seen USAID-funded treatment for HIV and AIDS dry up, which experts warn could lead to millions of deaths in the next four years. Noah Gottschalk, senior director for international advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish group that helps refugees around the world, told ABC that the closure of USAID has resulted in \u201cchaos.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had to stop programs, for example, with survivors of violence against women in Latin America, in countries like Colombia, in countries like Ecuador, women who fled abusive partners, and the support that we provide them is often the difference between them being forced to maybe return to those abusive former partners, or becoming vulnerable to human trafficking,\u201d Gottschalk said. It\u2019s not just foreigners. Americans are also needlessly suffering thanks to the actions of the Trump administration\u2014and it\u2019s not only the thousands of federal workers who were thrown onto the unemployment rolls just as the economy appears to be stalling. More than two dozen people\u2014USAID staffers or their spouses\u2014in the midst of high-risk pregnancies were left in limbo after the agency was shuttered, which stalled planned medical evacuations. Congressional Republicans are poised to slash Medicaid, which provides medical care for 40 percent of children in America, so they can extend huge tax cuts for corporations and the uber rich. The staff of the Social Security Administration may be cut in half, imperiling payments millions of seniors rely on. Even if, miraculously, these payments aren\u2019t interrupted, they may be slashed anyway\u2014there\u2019s simply no other way to pay for the tax and discretionary spending cuts promised by the Trump administration. That\u2019s not all! In Texas, one child is dead as the largest measles outbreak in over a decade rages\u2014an outbreak that was dismissed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaxxer running the Department of Health and Human Services, who told President Trump such an outbreak was \u201cnot unusual.\u201d (It very much is.) Kennedy has seemingly stalled development of next year\u2019s flu vaccine, is currently considering halting the development of another vaccine aimed at stopping bird flu (which has caused eggs to hit record prices), and abruptly canceled the development of a Covid vaccine pill shortly after being confirmed. Everywhere you look, you see death and devastation, nearly all of it preventable. Seven years ago, The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer identified the operating principle of the Trump administration. \u201cThe cruelty is the point,\u201d he wrote in October 2018. \u201cThis isn\u2019t incoherent. It reflects a clear principle: Only the president and his allies, his supporters, and their anointed are entitled to the rights and protections of the law, and if necessary, immunity from it. The rest of us are entitled only to cruelty, by their whim. This is how the powerful have ever kept the powerless divided and in their place, and enriched themselves in the process.\u201d This perfectly explained Trump\u2019s political project then; it is truer now than ever. But the motivation for it has somehow become even more sinister. Trump promised his supporters that he would be their \u201cretribution,\u201d and he is fulfilling that pledge by inflicting massive, unnecessary pain on the groups he and his supporters vilify as enemies of the people: immigrants, federal workers, trans people, even sick and starving people from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d And yet, it\u2019s also clear that the scope of his cruelty is much broader, for even Trump voters are not immune to the wholesale, indiscriminate destruction wrought by this administration. Some have lost their jobs. Some are at the risk of deportation. Some may find themselves at the mercy of a rapacious credit card company that no longer has to worry about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or perhaps they\u2019ll become deadly ill from a preventable disease because Kennedy convinced them not to get vaccinated. The misery that Trump is inflicting abroad is just the beginning. Soon, it will be inescapable in America as well, and not even a red MAGA hat can protect you.

        "title": "Trump Is Really Screwing Over Some of His Core Supporters | The New Republic",
        "text": "Last November, people in farming-dependent counties voted for Donald Trump by a staggering average of 78 percent. So why does he seem so hell-bent on screwing them over? Earlier this month, multiple outlets reported farmers\u2019 complaints that promised funds\u2014including reimbursements for improvements already paid for and installed\u2014had been frozen, contrary to the administration\u2019s assurances. Missouri cattle farmer Skylar Holden, in a viral video on TikTok, said that although he voted for Trump, his $240,000 contract with the Agriculture Department to improve infrastructure on his farm was now frozen, and he\u2019d already spent $80,000 on materials and labor. The Washington Post last week \u201cspoke with farmers and farm organizations in 10 states who had contacted their congressional delegations about the USDA funding freeze. Some farmers from conservative-leaning districts said they have received no reply. Others said they were told that their representatives supported the administration\u2019s decision\u2014and some representatives appeared to suggest that Trump\u2019s funding freeze was not affecting farmers at all.\u201d These kinds of stories are now proliferating in local news outlets in rural states, whose residents are also being hit by USDA firings. And this week, the Post revealed a new detail: After a federal judge blocked the freeze on January 28, middle managers at the Department of Agriculture asked superiors whether they could release these funds\u2014and were told they could not. But supposedly, this is getting resolved: Newly confirmed Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently claimed to have \u201crelease[d] the first tranche of funding that was paused due to the review of funding in the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d and promised that the department would \u201chonor contracts that were already made directly to farmers.\u201d You\u2019ll notice some caveats in there: \u201calready made\u201d and \u201cdirectly to farmers.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether this money will be enough, or be disbursed soon enough, for some of the farms in question, NBC\u2019s Suzy Khimm reported Saturday. First, the IRA funds aren\u2019t the only funds that have been frozen. Second, small farms operating on tight profit margins \u201cmake up a large proportion of the farms participating in some of the federal grant programs\u201d in question. And third, farming isn\u2019t something that can be put on hold: As March draws near, many farms are heading into thawing, planting, and animal birthing season. This, on its own, would be cause for concern in an agricultural system that already operates with worryingly few redundancies\u2014especially since American agriculture is also heavily dependent on immigrant workers, whom the Trump administration is also targeting. But it\u2019s not the only crisis at USDA right now. Only days after Rollins was sworn in, the department accidentally fired people working on the government\u2019s response to the H5N1 avian flu and had to set about trying to rehire them. While Trump said Friday that Rollins is \u201cgoing to do something with the eggs\u201d (by which he apparently meant lower egg prices), this is hardly a good start. NPR recently profiled two other workers fired at USDA, both of whom worked on securing the food system in the face of escalating threats from pests, pathogens, and climate shocks. This is consistent with recent New York Times reporting that some 400 people in the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have been fired, along with an estimated 800 agricultural scientists. The USDA apparently did not answer Times reporters\u2019 questions about how many employees had been fired overall, but current estimates are that around 4,200 probationary USDA employees alone have been laid off. Many experts already consider U.S. agriculture to be underprepared for the pathogens, pesticide resistance, weather pattern shifts, and other threats that are predicted to become more common. On Monday, a coalition of environmental groups and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York sued the USDA for \u201cunlawfully removing department webpages focused on climate change,\u201d which help farmers \u201cmake the best choices and access resources to mitigate harm to their livelihoods,\u201d according to the press release. Whether Rollins is the best person to sort through this mess is another question. As Mike Lavender, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, told journalist Tom Philpott on a recent podcast, the USDA is a large department, which means a core component of the job is \u201cmanaging a huge number of people.\u201d But aside from growing up on a farm, Rollins\u2019s primary qualification for this role seems to have been her time leading the America First Policy Institute, \u201cwhich was a relatively small think-tank organization that didn\u2019t focus a ton on agriculture,\u201d Lavender said. \u201cSo when you start parsing through her record, looking for the substantive linkages to domestic agricultural policy, there\u2019s not a ton there to go on, and there\u2019s not a lot of record of experience in managing huge businesses, organizations with a lot of employees, which is a significant part of the USDA role.\u201d One of the fired USDA employees NPR profiled was a veteran who\u2019d served in the Air Force for 20 years and was training dogs to detect contraband agricultural products so that potential pathogens and pests can be kept out of the U.S. \u201cI gave blood, sweat, and tears to this country for 20 years to continue service to the federal government,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cI kind of feel like I was just thrown out like a piece of trash.\u201d That\u2019s how much BP now plans to cut from its low-carbon investment plan, instead increasing its oil and gas production targets by 60 percent. Coffee Prices Are at a 50-Year High. Producers Aren\u2019t Celebrating. Last week, this newsletter mentioned some of the upward pressures on coffee prices right now, including the crop\u2019s particular vulnerability to climate change and weather shocks. The Times recently published a wonderfully in-depth feature on this topic, covering not just the market quirks that make this industry particularly tricky but also farmers\u2019 efforts to shift to new coffee varieties and farming techniques that may make them more resilient. Don\u2019t miss the more hopeful story of one farmer in Corqu\u00edn, Honduras: An agricultural engineer by training, Mr. Romero began studying how to shelter his own crop from the elements. He proposed adding a canopy of taller trees like pine and mahogany to cast shade over his coffee. That would keep moisture in the soil and preserve the health of the roots, allowing them to take up more water and nutrients. He made plans to intersperse fruit trees\u2014mangoes, oranges, lemons and plantains\u2014diversifying his harvest while adding additional roots to preserve soil. In 2009, Mr. Romero persuaded his wife, his parents and his brother to pool their land holdings, turning their 140 acres into a collective plantation that would pursue this new mode of operation, with sustainability as their lodestar. He organized two dozen other farms into a cooperative called Cafico. Members could share techniques and operate a nursery to produce suitable varieties of coffee plants and shade trees. They financed the construction of a mill to dry and process their harvest and sell the crop. They eschewed chemical fertilizers and pesticides, dedicating themselves to organic production. His pitch encountered initial resistance from potential members, given the arithmetic.\u2026 \u201cEveryone said we were crazy,\u201d said Mr. Romero, 45. \u201cNow, they are copying the model.\u201d Read Peter S. Goodman\u2019s and Alejandro Cegarra\u2019s full report at The New York Times. This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn. Sign up here. Last week, new data dropped showing that inflation has hit a seven-month high, driven in no small part by rising food, gas, and housing costs. Egg prices alone jumped 15.2 percent from December. But coffee and other items have also grown more expensive. As numerous pieces were quick to point out, this is not a great look for President Donald Trump, who campaigned on the promise of lowering costs for consumers on \u201cday one,\u201d and who has also promised lower interest rates, which the Fed is unlikely to deliver unless inflation is under control. Trump reacted to the inflation news by blaming his predecessor. \u201cBIDEN INFLATION UP!\u201d he posted on Truth Social. At least one survey already suggests consumers aren\u2019t buying this line: The University of Michigan\u2019s February survey of consumers found they expect inflation to increase, particularly in light of the tariffs Trump has slapped on top trading partners. Nor are economists overly impressed by Elon Musk\u2019s proposal to tackle the problem: dramatically slashing government spending. Even if Musk could cut spending as much as he suggests (doubtful, reports The Economist, which finds much evidence of chaos but not much movement in actual numbers) experts say the result would crash the economy. But the whom-to-blame discourse threatens to obscure a broader truth about food prices in particular right now: These price increases aren\u2019t random. While inflation overall is a complicated topic, to put it mildly, many of these individual price increases have clear causes and were accurately predicted not just months, but years in advance. And Team Trump, even without their sudden enthusiasm for tariffs, would be poorly suited to tackle these particular price hikes. That\u2019s because the dominant conservative model for fighting high cost of living\u2014removing regulations and cutting government spending\u2014isn\u2019t very well suited to the crises driving some of these increases. As Jan Dutkiewicz wrote at The New Republic last month, egg price increases are being driven partly by the H5N1 avian flu outbreak\u2014which is being exacerbated by longstanding underregulation of animal agriculture. \u201cVirtually all of the 100-or-so billion eggs produced annually in the United States come from factory farms,\u201d and \u201ccramming so many virtually genetically identical birds of the same breed into such tight quarters makes factory farms hotbeds of disease,\u201d Jan wrote. \u201cFor decades, public health experts have feared that the next big pandemic would originate in poultry.\u2026 Reducing the risk of zoonotic outbreaks in the food system, mostly by reducing land clearing for crops and moving away from the factory farming of animals, is a lesson we should have learned from previous avian flu outbreaks and from the 2009 swine flu outbreak. And it should have been driven home by the scope and scale of the human and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Paradoxically, he continued, the historical cheapness of eggs has fed a national egg-eating habit that now gives egg prices disproportionate sway over our overall experience of inflation: [I]f consumers eat a lot of eggs, the price of eggs will be weighted heavily in calculating the [Consumer Price Index]. As the Brookings Institute put it, in an article written before the current outbreak of H5N1, \u201cAmericans spend more on chicken than tofu, so changes in the price of chicken have a greater impact on the CPI.\u201d In the face of a supply shock like H5N1, egg prices rise much faster than those of other goods, which not only drives up CPI but makes the difference in prices very obviously visible to shoppers, even though most of them don\u2019t connect the price hikes to a disease ravaging farms thousands of miles away from their supermarket. Cheap eggs might just be a bad long-term goal to aim for, Jan argued. And whether or not you agree with that conclusion, cheap eggs seem like a difficult outcome for the Trump team to deliver merely by slashing spending and regulations. They could, of course, simply stop doing anything about the avian flu: no more testing, and thus no more culling of diseased chicken flocks or federal compensation for those culls. This \u201clet the world burn\u201d strategy is not impossible to imagine of Trump\u2014but it\u2019s hard to see how this would accomplish the putative goal, given that sick birds typically stop laying eggs. The Trump administration\u2019s economic approach also seems suboptimally calibrated for dealing with the kind of price volatility we\u2019re starting to see with coffee. In January, Arabica coffee futures spiked to record levels amid tariff fears, The Wall Street Journal reported\u2014but that wasn\u2019t the only reason for the volatility. Severe drought in Brazil and wild swings in precipitation in Vietnam\u2014the world\u2019s two top coffee-producing countries\u2014had already lowered yields. This is consistent with what researchers have long predicted might happen as climate change accelerates. In fact, last March, researchers with the European Central Bank calculated that \u201cweather and climate shocks\u201d alone may drive food price increases of 1.5\u20131.8 percentage points a year within a decade, and increases of 2.2\u20134.3 percentage points a year by 2060. Coffee has long been identified, along with chocolate, as a crop particularly sensitive to these weather changes. In fact, chocolate prices are also way up for weather reasons, leading to multiple stories last week (and a data-heavy report from Climate Central) explaining the context to Valentine\u2019s Day shoppers. Deregulation and cutting all funds geared at addressing climate change isn\u2019t going to help this problem. \u201cDrill, baby, drill,\u201d the slogan Trump adopted for his inauguration, has long been the Republican rallying cry for economic growth and low cost of living. But Democrats have tried this approach, too, and it\u2019s not even very effective at lowering gas prices\u2014much less the prices of things that get harder to produce the more fossil fuels you burn. There are, of course, efforts to diversify coffee strains and make the global coffee market more resilient to climate shocks. One of the bodies funding those efforts was the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration is now dismantling. That\u2019s how much money\u2014intended for states, municipalities, and nonprofits\u2014remained frozen in EPA coffers as of the end of last week, despite court orders for the Trump administration to resume disbursements, according to Inside Climate News. \u2018The path forward is clear\u2019: how Trump taking office has \u2018turbocharged\u2019 climate accountability efforts Last spring, Liza Featherstone wrote at TNR about Vermont\u2019s new law, following the federal \u201cSuperfund\u201d model for chemical cleanups, that aims to make fossil fuel companies pay into a fund that can then be used to offset the costs of climate disasters. This model of climate policy, The Guardian\u2019s Dharna Noor reports, is now spreading rapidly, although courtroom challenges from the fossil fuel industry are spreading almost as quickly: \u201cI think Trump\u2019s election has turbocharged the \u2018make polluters pay\u2019 movement,\u201d said [Jamie] Henn, who has been a leader in the campaign for a decade.\u2026 The state of Vermont in May passed a first-of-its-kind law holding fossil fuel firms financially responsible for climate damages and New York passed a similar measure in December.\u2026 Similar bills are being considered in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts and now Rhode Island, where a measure was introduced last week. A policy will also soon be introduced in California, where recent deadly wildfires have revived the call for the proposal after one was weighed last year. Minnesota and Oregon lawmakers are also considering introducing climate superfund acts. And since inauguration day, activists and officials in a dozen other states have expressed interest in doing the same, said Henn. \u201cI think people are really latching on to this message and this approach right now,\u201d Henn said. \u201cIt finally gives people a way to respond to climate disasters, and it\u2019s something that we can do without the federal government.\u201d Read Dharna Noor\u2019s full report at The Guardian.

On Monday night, a new coalition of progressive and environmental groups held a call outlining a strategy to \u201cfight Trump and the oil oligarchs.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been on defensive for the last three weeks, but it\u2019s time for us to go on the offensive,\u201d said Friends of the Earth President Erich Pica. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep drinking out of the firehose,\u201d said host Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, an organizing group born out of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The call was one of several recent signs that, after lying low for the first few weeks of the Trump administration, environmental groups are suiting up for battle. The United to End Polluter Handouts coalition\u2014which among its over 30 members includes the youth-focused Sunrise Movement, NextGen America, and Zero Hour; senior-focused Third Act; consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen; and social justice grassroots organization Hip Hop Caucus\u2014is embracing a particular strategy, organizers on the call explained: to target the budget reconciliation process in March with a demand to end fossil fuel subsidies. The goal, organizers say, is not just to strike a blow against the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s also to hit oil executives in a way that undermines Trump\u2019s entire platform. The reconciliation process needed to pass the tax bill, Pica argued, is where the rubber of the Trump administration meets the road. \u201cThey want to pass this tax cut bill so they have to cut other types of social spending. They want to increase defense at the cost of SNAP, increase oil and gas subsidies at the expense of Medicaid. This is their big plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their plan because they don\u2019t have the votes in the Senate to pass anything other than a tax bill.\u201d So that\u2019s where environmental and other progressive groups \u201ccan pick a fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t win, we will use this moment to gum up the reconciliation package.\u201d A significant part of the task, he and others on the call agreed, would be forcing Democrats to \u201chold the line.\u201d That\u2019s easier said than done. As several people on the call acknowledged, politicians typically look for deals in these sorts of negotiations. Democrats so far have not indicated much willingness to fight via all available means. And at the end of the day, the GOP does have the votes to push a reconciliation package through, with or without Democratic cooperation. But the groups on the call Monday aren\u2019t the only ones unveiling new strategies in the coming weeks. The Center for Biological Diversity, for example, launched 266 lawsuits against environmental rollbacks under the last Trump administration alongside other environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council\u2014winning a striking majority of them. \u201cBecause [Trump and Elon Musk] have moved with such speed it has taken a little bit of time for us to catch up,\u201d Center for Biological Diversity Government Affairs Director Brett Hartl told me by phone. \u201cBut I think we expect to have at least one or two more lawsuits against DOGE,\u201d he said, in addition to those already filed by such groups as Democratic attorneys general, \u201cand I think there\u2019ll be other lawsuits challenging aspects of some of the executive orders in the next, I would say one to three weeks.\u201d Despite the widely reported absence of \u201cthe resistance\u201d this time around, these groups emphasize that they haven\u2019t gone anywhere. And there\u2019s another common theme: While the opposition is at a significant disadvantage given Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, the dizzying pace of the administration\u2019s opening weeks, they argue, masks vulnerability\u2014which Trump\u2019s opponents can exploit. \u201cPresident Trump and the Republicans are weak,\u201d Pica said Monday, pointing to the thin GOP majority dictating a need to pass legislation via the budget reconciliation process. \u201cThis is an opportunity to lay out and expose Trump for who he really is,\u201d Sunrise Movement Executive Director Aru Shiney-Ajay said. \u201cThe reason he has such a high approval rating is that he was able to fool people into thinking that he fought for everyday people.\u201d Attacking his \u201coligarch\u201d allies, she and others on the call argued, undermines his core appeal to certain voters. Environmental advocate Bill McKibben recently proposed a similar approach in his newsletter The Crucial Years. \u201cOur job is not to stop what Trump is doing, because we can\u2019t,\u201d he wrote to fellow activists. \u201cOur basic job is to make what he\u2019s doing is deeply unpopular, because that will stiffen the backbone of the courts and any remaining moderate Republicans, and set us up for possible gains if and when we next have elections. So: witness, communicate, ridicule, amplify strong voices.\u201d And if the would-be activists reading that newsletter are still sitting stunned on their sofas, uncertain what to do with the barrage of news over the last few weeks? When I asked Hartl what he would say to environmentally concerned readers who might be feeling more overwhelmed than empowered at present, he pointed to the need to distinguish substance from show. \u201cMake sure that elected officials and your representatives and people know when [Trump\u2019s] actions are causing real harm, as opposed to the noise and chaos that he is so good at generating all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is his one true superpower, is flooding the news with nonsensical chaos.\u201d While many of the spectacular Week One executive orders on environmental matters were ultimately symbolic requests for agencies to produce reports, (which is part of why groups were slow to sue, Hartl explained) halting Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, disbursements is another matter. \u201cPeople are going to lose their jobs, because the money\u2019s not going to be there so they\u2019re not going to be able to do the work they were promised to do,\u201d he said. Like many in the past week, Hartl questioned whether Trump actually has the political support for these sorts of moves. \u201cHe promised to have the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world. He told everyone RFK Jr. was going to fix our broken food systems and get chemicals out of the environment. He didn\u2019t run a campaign on utterly destroying the environment and killing people\u2019s jobs,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cSo folks need to bring all that to light, because they\u2019re deeply unpopular. And his one vulnerability is that he is actually incredibly thin-skinned and sensitive to public opinion. The only thing that really makes him change his mind is when things are going bad\u2014and then he\u2019ll just change on a whim cause he doesn\u2019t really have any principles.\u201d That\u2019s how likely it is that the target set by the Paris climate agreement\u2014limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures\u2014has already been crossed, according to a new study.

Farmers on the hook for millions after Trump freezesUSDA funds That\u2019s how likely it is that the target set by the Paris climate agreement\u2014limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures\u2014has already been crossed, according to a new study. Read CNN\u2019s report on this study and two other grim ones here. The Washington Post paints a portrait of utter chaos following the president\u2019s Day One order to halt disbursements from the IRA. While the White House \u201crepeatedly said the freeze of agriculture funding and other federal financial assistance would not affect benefits that go directly to individuals, such as farmers,\u201d the Post reports that farmers were still unable to access funds\u2014including reimbursements for projects already completed\u2014as of last weekend. [Last] Wednesday, National Farmers Union President Rob Larew testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee that the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping decisions on federal funding were creating concern for farmers across the country. \u201cNo one knows what funding will be available or if key programs will have the staff needed to operate,\u201d Larew said. \u201cFreezing spending and making sweeping decisions without congressional oversight just adds more uncertainty to an already tough farm economy.\u201d Skylar Holden, a cattle farmer in eastern Missouri, said he signed a $240,000 contract in December under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to share costs on investments for his farm. With the funding, Holden erected new fencing and installed a well. He had planned further improvements to his farm\u2019s water system and spent $80,000 on materials and labor contracts that he expected would be partly paid back by the government. This month, a USDA representative told him the funding was paused because of Trump\u2019s executive order. Read the full report from Daniel Wu, Gaya Gupta, and Anumita Kaur here.

If you\u2019ve found it impossible to keep track of all the news in the past two weeks, you\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of where things stand on the environmental front, two weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s second term\u2014and a few themes that might not be apparent from the daily headline deluge. (The typical Trump-era caveat applies: This list may be outdated by the time you read it, given the rapid pace of executive actions so far, and it\u2019s not intended to be exhaustive.) Within hours of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cUnleashing American Energy,\u201d a roughly 3,500-word document ordering all agencies to review, identify, and begin the suspension or reversal of any policies \u201cthat impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources\u2014with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources,\u201d or that somehow restrict \u201cconsumer choice of vehicles and appliances.\u201d The order also revoked a number of Biden-era executive orders to do with clean energy, climate change adaptation, and the establishment of a national Climate Corps; ordered the agencies to take steps to expedite the federal permitting process; barred agencies from using \u201cmethodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated\u201d in their environmental analyses (specifically singling out the concept of the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d); and ordered all agencies to \u201cimmediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \u2026 or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,\u201d with electric vehicle programs specifically put in the crosshairs. It also outlined protocol for fast-tracking the approval of liquefied natural gas ports and instructed agencies to remove any \u201cundue burdens\u201d on the mineral mining industry and prioritize actions to facilitate mineral extraction. In the same flurry of week one orders, Trump declared a \u201cnational energy emergency,\u201d ordering agencies to use emergency authorities to speed oil and gas production (but not solar and wind power). A separate order singled out Alaska\u2019s reserves in particular for exploitation. Trump withdrew the country from the Paris climate accord and Joe Biden\u2019s U.S. International Climate Finance Plan, ordered agencies to rethink water distribution in Southern California (which the federal government doesn\u2019t really control), and ordered a performance review for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. He also ordered a blanket pause on federal grant money, which would affect a number of environmental and clean energy programs\u2014although this order was then rescinded and also paused by multiple federal judges. On January 29, the Senate confirmed Trump\u2019s nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency head, Lee Zeldin\u2014a noted Trump loyalist. Trump also appointed David Fotouhi (another Trump EPA veteran, who recently as a litigator challenged the EPA\u2019s asbestos ban) as second in command, tapped chemical industry insiders Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva to lead the EPA\u2019s chemical regulation, and named two former oil lobbyists\u2014Alex Dominguez and Aaron Szabo\u2014to manage auto emissions and air pollution for the agency. Meanwhile, newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy instructed the Department of Transportation to preferentially fund projects serving areas with higher marriage and birth rates, and began the process of reversing Biden policies on fuel efficiency standards. This week opened with the administration reminding all recently hired EPA workers via email that \u201cas a probationary/trial period employee,\u201d they could be fired immediately\u2014an EPA-specific escalation from the prior week\u2019s general threats and buyouts offered to all federal workers via the extrajudicial powers of Elon Musk. The White House also announced the nomination of Neil Jacobs, known for altering a map of the projected path of Hurricane Dorian with a Sharpie during Trump\u2019s first administration, in an attempt to corroborate the president\u2019s misleading tweet, to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Senate confirmed Trump\u2019s nominee, the fracking executive Chris Wright, to lead the Department of Energy. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the EPA would also be \u201cdemoting career employees who oversee scientific research, the enforcement of pollution laws, hazardous waste cleanup and the agency\u2019s human resources department and will replace them with political appointees.\u201d So what does this add up to? And how does it fit into the much larger flurry of executive actions on foreign aid, immigration, public health, LGBTQ rights, and more in the past two weeks? First, while some aspects of Trump\u2019s first two weeks (such as the speed and scale of some of the assaults on the federal workforce, the attacks on USAID in particular, handing over the federal payment system to Musk and his teenage staff) have surprised even watchful experts, you really can\u2019t say that most of these environmental moves come as a shock. They\u2019re fully in line with what informed observers expected from a reelected Trump administration; the president has been telegraphing these decisions for months, and they\u2019re also found in the pages of the GOP\u2019s Project 2025 policy manifesto. The second theme here is that\u2014as with many of Trump\u2019s other moves, and as this newsletter predicted two weeks ago, noting the oligarchic aesthetics of the inauguration festivities\u2014you really can follow the money. All of these actions benefit specific industries and people. Gutting the environmental review and permitting process and greenlighting liquefied natural gas terminals will please the oil and gas industry that Trump explicitly courted for donations during his campaign. Killing the electric vehicle subsidy will please Musk\u2014who has openly said this would benefit Tesla (currently struggling) by hurting the company\u2019s competitors. In general, putting corporate lobbyists in charge of regulating the industries they come from is a good way to please corporate interests, and revoking any policy that restricts \u201cconsumer choice\u201d in household appliances tends to benefit companies manufacturing appliances that are dangerous. The third point is one that pertains to many of Trump\u2019s moves in other areas, as well. Right now there seems to be a stark divide in the commentariat: an open argument over whether the administration\u2019s actions over the past two weeks are a catastrophic attack on literally lifesaving programs and American political norms, or merely a predictable show of bluster from team Trump that will inevitably be slowed or halted by legal challenges and lack of congressional support. But both these things can be true at once. It\u2019s possible\u2014likely, even\u2014that many of Trump\u2019s initial actions will fizzle for legal or organizational reasons. It\u2019s also possible for these actions to do a lot of damage, even if the specific orders are eventually countermanded. \u201cOn Friday morning,\u201d Brett Murphy and Anna Maria Barry-Jester recently reported for ProPublica, \u201cthe staffers at a half dozen U.S.-funded medical facilities in Sudan who care for severely malnourished children had a choice to make: Defy President Donald Trump\u2019s order to immediately stop their operations or let up to 100 babies and toddlers die.\u201d The effects of halting funds for environmental programs won\u2019t be as gut-wrenchingly immediate as the halt on foreign aid. But the same principle applies across multiple fields: Programs and projects operating on tight margins and relying on predicted federal funds to show up can\u2019t necessarily wait for this all to be cleared up. \u201cWe have one woman in her 80s who lives alone, and if she does not get her roof fixed, well, we\u2019re going to have a senior in her late 80s who is homeless,\u201d Warren Tidwell, leading efforts to repair storm damage in Alabama using IRA funds, recently told the Times. The same article pointed to farmers and small-business owners waiting for reimbursement who went into debt to fund improvements that the Rural Energy for America Program was supposed to reimburse, or clean energy projects whose status is suddenly up in the air. The uncertainty alone will probably shutter some projects. The overarching analysis is fairly grim. Trump was hardly an unknown quantity. The chaos he has unleashed was predictable, as was his capture by a slew of cronies benefiting from a rollback of sensible energy and environmental policy. If anything\u2019s getting lost in all the Sturm und Drang, it\u2019s that ordinary people will wind up impoverished or harmed as a select few profit, regardless of how things ultimately play out in the courts. That alone ought to be generating more opposition, and more pointed media coverage, than we\u2019re currently seeing. A paper published this week found a 50 percent increase in microplastics in human brains in 2024 as compared to 2016. How Trump\u2019s USAID shutdown threatens the world\u2019s climate goals The attempt to completely shutter USAID hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention as other Trump orders. But it\u2019s one of the places where these early actions could do significant and irreversible damage. In addition to USAID\u2019s lifesaving work in public health, Jake Bittle reminds readers at Grist, the agency also distributes funds to help \u201clow-income countries build renewable energy and adapt to worsening natural disasters, as well as conserve carbon sinks and sensitive ecosystems.\u201d The piece also serves as an important reminder that public health and climate change can\u2019t really be siloed into separate categories. Even if USAID eventually resumes operations to provide emergency humanitarian assistance such as famine support and HIV prevention, the agency is still likely to terminate all its climate-related work under the Trump administration. The result would be a blow to the landmark Paris climate agreement just as significant as Trump\u2019s formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the international pact. By clawing back billions of dollars that Congress has already committed to the fight against global warming, the U.S. is poised to derail climate progress far beyond its own borders.\u2026 In 2022 \u2026 USAID offices around the world began tweaking their operations to ensure the projects they were funding would hold up as temperatures continue to rise. For example, the agency would ensure water and sewer systems could handle bigger floods, or would plan to inoculate against diseases that might spread faster in warm weather.\u2026 Zimbabwe\u2019s minister for climate and the environment, Washington Zhakata, said that a shutoff of USAID funding will make it nearly impossible for the country to meet its commitments to the Paris agreement. The country has promised not only to develop renewable energy but also to spend huge amounts of money on drought and flood protections. It has developed a nationwide adaptation plan on the premise that future funding would be provided\u2014and provided in large part by the countries that are responsible for the most carbon emissions historically, like the U.S. Read Jake Bittle\u2019s full report at Grist. This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn. Sign up here. Last week, Trump appointed two veterans of his first administration, Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, to lead chemical regulation at the Environmental Protection Agency. Beck is a chemical industry lobbyist. Dekleva is currently senior director at the American Chemistry Council, an organization whose positions include opposing the EPA\u2019s recent, arguably belated ban on noncritical uses of methylene chloride\u2014a chemical so toxic that it has been shown to poison even trained workers using protective gear. These appointments, while buried beneath the landslide of other headlines out of the White House over the past week, served as a critical indicator: Specifically, they dashed the (limited) hopes some advocates were nursing that right-wingers\u2019 newish preoccupation with environmental health\u2014embodied primarily in the chaotic figure of Trump\u2019s Health and Human Services nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2014might make the second Trump administration marginally more environmentally friendly on chemical and plastics regulation than the first one. The Washington Post, covering the appointments, highlighted the typical rationale for appointing industry insiders to such posts: that the EPA\u2019s chemical approval process needs reform. \u201cThe EPA\u2019s flawed decision-making process has consequently inhibited American innovation and our ability to compete in the global market,\u201d according to Republican Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky. The Post also quoted lawyer Dimitri Karakitsos, who has represented chemical companies, arguing the approval process for new chemicals is actually impeding environmental progress: \u201cA lot of these new chemicals tend to be greener and safer, and we want that innovation on the market,\u201d he said. Is that true? It\u2019s a counterintuitive take, given that the EPA has come under heavy criticism in recent years for failing to ban even chemicals that dozens of other countries have chosen to ban over links to severe health damage. I called two experts to get their perspectives on the matter. \u201cI actually do think that there are tremendous innovations and discoveries of new chemicals happening today,\u201d Yale School of the Environment professor and former director of the U.S. Green Chemistry Program Paul Anastas told me. \u201cAnd yes \u2026 when you can demonstrate these things\u2014that it\u2019s safer, greener, performs better\u2014there should be a more effective way of fast-tracking these innovations into the marketplace so that they can make their positive benefits.\u201d At the same time, he said, \u201cthe role of science at EPA is fundamental, and everything that the EPA does must be science-based.\u201d A key part of the industry position, however, is that U.S. regulatory procedures are somehow exceptionally obstructive, particularly in an international context. Those with experience in this international context say that argument doesn\u2019t hold up. \u201cThe idea that U.S. chemical regulation is so advanced that it hinders and slows down U.S. competitivity is preposterous,\u201d said David Azoulay, director of environmental health at the Center for International Environmental Law, or CIEL, over the phone from Geneva. The U.S. has \u201cthe least stringent, least efficient, and least protective legislation compared to any of the other major economies\u2014and that includes economies like the EU of course, which is the most often mentioned, but also includes Korea, Japan, even China.\u201d The EU, for example, \u201cregulates or bans over 1,300 chemicals in cosmetics. The U.S. bans less than two dozen.\u201d The anti-regulatory argument also rests on the assumption that regulating to prevent environmental harm slows innovation. But when CIEL investigated this in 2013, Azoulay said, using patent applications as a proxy for innovation, \u201cevery time there was a new type of regulatory control measure being put in place around phthalates, we saw a spike in a number of patents being filed for new products or new substances or new applications that didn\u2019t use phthalates.\u201d He also pointed to a wealth of recent research showing that, contrary to the assumption that regulations hurt the economy, under-regulating harmful chemicals can cost billions of dollars. These studies probably aren\u2019t going to prevent people from arguing that EPA regulations harm American companies\u2019 ability to compete. \u201cAn additional perspective that\u2019s useful to consider,\u201d Azoulay added, \u201cis that, contrary to some simplified beliefs, the chemical industry is very much a global industry. All of those major chemical producers are multinationals that have production bases in the U.S., in Europe, in China, in the Gulf, in other places, that try to take advantage of being closest to the primary materials or the markets or whatever.\u201d And the arguments everywhere seem to be the same: \u201cThose rules in that particular jurisdiction are hindering competitivity. But because it\u2019s the same companies making the same arguments, what they\u2019re actually doing is trying to bring the floor down, and trying to lower the level of protection of health and the environment.\u201d If the track record of the first Trump administration is any indicator, those companies may be pleased by what happens next at the EPA. Then again, maybe they won\u2019t. When the first Trump administration tried to weaken methylene chloride regulations, for example, they were quickly and repeatedly sued. Rushed, poorly evidenced environmental rollbacks in the first Trump administration were what allowed groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council to boast that \u201con average, we sued once every ten days for four years, and we won victories in nearly 90 percent of the resolved cases.\u201d As these battles play out, however, many fear the toll\u2014to insufficiently protected workers, to the people passively absorbing toxic chemicals in their environment, and to ecosystems\u2014may mount. A new study pushes back against earlier ones suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s system of currents is slowing down. This study finds no evidence of the system weakening at all\u2014very good news, given that, as previously discussed in this newsletter, a lot of agriculture depends on the weather systems that depend, in turn, on these currents. Maryland\u2019s renewable energy program isn\u2019t working, a new report suggests. Inside Climate News\u2019s Aman Azhar explains the findings and talks to the report\u2019s authors, who say this is a \u201cwell-known problem in the state that people don\u2019t want to talk about.\u201d A previous edition of this newsletter noted that a so-called attribution study of climate change\u2019s contribution to the L.A. fires might take time. Only two weeks later, a report from the World Weather Attribution group calculates that climate change made the hot, dry, windy conditions that helped the fires spread 35 percent more likely. Kentucky\u2019s Mountaintop Mines Are Turned Into Neighborhoods Old coal mines that blew the tops off mountains have left lots of manmade plateaus in Kentucky. While these \u201cecological graveyards\u201d may not be as lush as the landscape they\u2019ve replaced, Austyn Gaffney writes, they may prove to be a lifeline in a state struggling to adapt to increasingly severe floods: In 2022, apocalyptic flooding swept across eastern Kentucky, killing 45 people, destroying 542 homes and damaging thousands more. Now, instead of rebuilding in the floodplain, the state is permanently lifting residents onto safer land. Officials are more than two years into a nearly $800 million plan to reclaim these landscapes again, turning them from deserts into developments.\u2026 Seven communities across four counties, with aspirational names like Skyview and Olive Branch, have been designed for 665 brand-new properties, some of which will run on solar. Fourteen houses have been completed and about a dozen people have moved in to two communities called Thompson Branch and Wayland, according to the state.

In the first hours of his second term, President Trump signed executive orders re-withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back incentives for electric vehicles, pausing approvals for wind farms in federal waters, and declaring a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d to expedite drilling and open up more land and sea for drilling. He also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization, signed an unconstitutional order trying to end birthright citizenship, attempted to set a national two-gender policy, ordered federal workers back to the office while making it easier to fire them, rescinded a Biden order lowering prescription drug costs, and pardoned those who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. You may remember this pattern from 2016\u2014the \u201cthrow everything at them, plus a kitchen sink and ferret, ideally at 3 a.m. on Twitter\u201d approach to politics. Trump\u2019s first term was characterized by multiple news bombshells per day, a bewildering number of unrelated proclamations, crises, and scandals per week, and each Friday closing with politicians, media workers, and news readers struggling to remember what had happened just a few days prior. It\u2019s no wonder a book urging digital detox and bird-watching as a form of radical political action became a breakout hit. This time around, people have announced they\u2019re tuning out; essayists (including at TNR) have mused what ethical retreat and rest might look like during Trump 2.0; and leftists on Bluesky are urging fellow activists to \u201cfind your lane\u201d and focus on that, rather than trying to track every last move the administration makes on the environment, reproductive autonomy, trans rights, immigration, etc. The downside of choosing a lane, though, is that it makes it harder to see the themes emerging in Trump\u2019s second presidency. And there are already some through lines on the climate front that aren\u2019t perceptible in the catalog of his executive orders alone. The three richest men in the world watched from prominent seats\u2014in front of Cabinet nominees\u2014as Trump was sworn in on Monday. As the president bragged about the country\u2019s oil and gas reserves, promising to \u201cexport American energy all over the world,\u201d applause broke out not just in the Capitol Rotunda, The New York Times reported, but \u201cat the Hay-Adams hotel in downtown Washington, where some of the country\u2019s leading oil and gas executives popped champagne and ate mini Pop-Tart pastries with Mr. Trump\u2019s image,\u201d hosted by fracking magnate Harold Hamm, who personally donated $4.3 million to pro-Trump PACs. Since April 2024, when Trump promised fossil fuel execs at Mar-a-Lago favorable policies in exchange for campaign donations, top fossil fuel billionaires\u2019 wealth has grown by $40.2 billion, the Climate Accountability Research Project recently reported. I remember a time when I didn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d the Green New Deal: A lot of the policies associated with it, like affordable housing and single-payer health care, seemed like good ideas but sort of orthogonal to the primary goal of lowering emissions. But it\u2019s a political strategy as much as an ideological statement, and the political strategy rests on two core insights: first, that not only is it hard to disentangle inequality and the climate crisis, but the unchecked power of the wealthy is in fact driving rampant emissions and obstructing the progress of policies to curtail them. Second, climate policies and the politicians supporting them will not succeed without the ability to demonstrate material benefits in people\u2019s everyday lives. In other words: For long-term success, climate policies can\u2019t just be about lowering emissions. They need to show people that low-carbon life can be fun. They need to be defanging the culture war. If the spectacle of ring-kissing billionaires at Trump\u2019s second inauguration doesn\u2019t show once and for all that Green New Deal supporters have a point, I\u2019m not sure what will. Because these executive orders aren\u2019t coming from the electorate: Outside the pro-petroleum Pop-Tart crowd at the Hay-Adams, these policies just aren\u2019t that popular. Wind power is still backed by 72 percent of the population, per a Pew poll last year, while only a minority support further offshore drilling and even fewer back fracking. That\u2019s hardly a ringing endorsement for the platform Trump announced at a Sunday rally\u2014that \u201cwe\u2019re going to drill, baby, drill and do all of the things that we wanted to\u201d but \u201caren\u2019t going to do the wind thing.\u201d The policies\u2019 political currency comes instead from their culture-war status, i.e., their ability to motivate a core group of voters and a lot of money. Culture wars, as several writers at TNR have pointed out in recent years, are a deft bit of political theater that more often than not turn out to serve corporate interests. Per Green New Deal thinking, the way to combat that\u2014aside from taxing billionaires out of a few of their zeros\u2014is to enact policies that provide people with a more material benefit on a regular Tuesday than the fossil fuel industrial complex does. Who knows whether this theory will ultimately be proven correct? (This week, Liza Featherstone wrote for TNR about one intriguing but vulnerable policy currently testing it: New York City\u2019s congestion pricing.) But as Trump\u2019s inaugural spectacle shows, we\u2019re way past the point where his opponents can afford to ridicule this progressive strategy as \u201cthe green dream or whatever\u201d\u2014as Pelosi did during Trump\u2019s first term. Socialists shouldn\u2019t be the only ones noting the reactionary role \u201ccapital\u201d has played in this election and inauguration. And there\u2019s a message here for ordinary news consumers too: Whatever approach you take in processing the incoming onslaught, keep an eye on the oligarchy of it all. If you\u2019re staying in your \u201clane,\u201d remember that these lanes are often connected\u2014and what connects them is often money. Not all of Trump\u2019s attempts to scrap pro-environment policies will hold up in court or have the effect he\u2019s promised supporters that they will have. Meanwhile, America\u2019s second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement has so far mostly drawn criticism and pledges from other countries to stay the course. Things aren\u2019t looking good for the endangered right whale. After much hemming and hawing, the Biden administration in its final days ultimately dropped a proposal to tighten speed limits to prevent deadly ship strikes. That\u2019s the portion of the once-great carbon sink that, as the ground thaws, is now adding emissions to the atmosphere rather than subtracting them, according to a new study. What happens when the California fires go out? More gentrification. Climate disasters don\u2019t level the playing field, this piece suggests: They just clear it for bigger buildings, mortgages, and rental bills. This could be what happens in Los Angeles in the wake of recent fires: When a natural disaster strikes a community, housing prices almost always rise. In the short term, the reason is obvious: Apartments and houses have been damaged or destroyed, so there are fewer of them, and that decline in supply causes rents to spike. But as rebuilding efforts drag on, many middle- and low-income people never return to their neighborhoods because they can\u2019t afford to. \u201cOne of the reasons gentrification happens is that everything just becomes more expensive,\u201d said Jennifer Gray Thompson, founder and CEO of After the Fire, a nonprofit that helps communities prepare for and recover from wildfires. One reason is the high cost of building, but there are others, including landlords taking advantage of high demand to raise rents and real estate investors buying up properties to try to profit off of them later.

In Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s widely acclaimed, Obama-praised climate novel, The Ministry for the Future, the climate crisis is already well underway when catastrophic rains drown Los Angeles in water. Recreational kayaks and motorboats become crucial rescue vehicles, thousands die in the floods, and early projections suggest some $30 trillion in damage. \u201cSo now,\u201d the main character muses, \u201cone could imagine that the American people might support action on the climate change front. Better late than never! But no. Already it was becoming clear that LA was not popular in Texas, or on the east coast, or even in San Francisco for that matter.\u201d Despite these public sentiments, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s government, one of the most progressive in the world, and the US federal government, one of the most reactionary in the world\u2014both were making efforts to help.\u201d And the devastation of a famed city shocked just enough elites to make a difference: \u201cIf it could happen to LA, rich as it was, dreamy as it was, it could happen anywhere. Some deep flip in the global unconscious was making people queasy.\u201d Los Angeles\u2019s disaster becomes one of the key turning points leading to a global carbon coin. Right now, Los Angeles is burning. But so far, the incineration of over 40,000 acres in America\u2019s second-largest city doesn\u2019t seem poised to be any kind of turning point. The Wall Street Journal published an editorial ridiculing the idea that climate change could have driven both the exceptionally wet winters in 2023 and 2024 and the recent dry spell. (While a full so-called attribution study on climate change\u2019s contribution to the fires will take time, there\u2019s already a lot of research suggesting climate change can, in fact, increase both flooding and fire risks, and early analysis out of UCLA suggests climate change did play a role here.) Georgia congresswoman and renowned random-number-generator Marjorie Taylor Greene asked why \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t use geoengineering to dump rain on the fires. Donald Trump, days away from his second term as president, blamed the destruction on Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom and a tiny fish called the delta smelt, outlandishly claiming that policies to protect the endangered species had deliberately deprived Los Angeles of water. (This whopper was universally panned by fact-checkers.) And Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary has previously denied that climate change has anything to do with wildfires. One line in Robinson\u2019s novel rings particularly true: A lot of people seem to dislike L.A.\u2014or at least a lot of right-wingers seem to dislike its image as haven for California liberals. The Journal also blamed the fires on Democrats: Newsom, the state legislature, and \u201cthe mayors of Los Angeles,\u201d in that order, for spending money on climate policy that could have been spent directly on wildfire prevention (wildfire prevention also received funding). Republican Representative Warren Davidson, from Ohio, suggested on Fox Business last week that California should only get federal disaster aid \u201cif they change their policies.\u201d He was a little vague about which California policies needed to be changed. Elon Musk, right-wing actor James Woods, former Fox host Megyn Kelly, and conservative CNN commentator Scott Jennings all blamed the unchecked blazes on diversity hiring within the Los Angeles Fire Department. Another favorite target has been the environmental review process, which can delay risk-reduction practices like thinning or prescribed burns. (Libertarian Reason magazine\u2014not a typical defender of regulation\u2014was an unexpected voice debunking the notion that environmental review was to blame.) The fires in L.A. have thankfully not yet reached the level of devastation Robinson portrayed in his novel. But the cascading effects of this type of disaster also make the scale of the destruction larger than it might seem from any one news story: Not only have at least 24 people been killed, but the smoke hazards threaten thousands or even millions more. The damage from smoke inhalation\u2014not just in terms of immediate respiratory problems but in terms of increased cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and even dementia risk\u2014may only be tallied years later. Measuring destruction in terms of the number of homes burned can also be misleading, as if the fires\u2019 effect on individual people and households can be reduced to \u201cDid your home burn down or not?\u201d and \u201cDid you have insurance or not?\u201d Being displaced is expensive, particularly if it means missing work as well. Those who have homes to return to but find their workplace has burned down, or their child\u2019s school or daycare building has burned down, also face significant disruption and expense. Tap water could remain unusable for a while, multiple experts have emphasized. You can\u2019t have destruction at this scale and not face a bottleneck of builders, repair workers, and materials afterward\u2014affecting timelines not just for rebuilding but, most likely, unrelated repairs as well, both for renters and owners. Housing will get even more expensive than it already is. Without massive regulatory intervention, home insurance will get even patchier and less affordable\u2014in a state already plagued by sky-high premiums and cancellations. Beneath the many headlines about how celebrities or Hollywood filming schedules are faring, the reality is that any of these factors alone can spell serious disruption or even financial catastrophe for vulnerable households, and even less vulnerable ones. Despite this massive upheaval, there\u2019s little sign that the wildfires are serving as a turning point even for policymakers who are trying to address the disaster. A one-year moratorium on insurance cancellations and nonrenewals, recently issued by the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, won\u2019t help much unless state and federal policymakers use that time to come up with a more durable solution. Newsom\u2019s decision to suspend the environmental review process for homeowners and businesses trying to rebuild isn\u2019t a panacea, either. \u201cFor many Angelenos, this is our most jarring confrontation yet with global warming,\u201d Los Angeles Times\u2019 Sammy Roth wrote this week. \u201cBut hundreds of millions of Americans have faced fossil-fueled disasters, and the politics of climate obstruction have hardly budged.\u201d Time will tell whether that eventually changes. For now, the turning points of Robinson\u2019s novel feel a long way off. Can ants help fight the crop diseases that climate change seems to be intensifying? Read Ayurella Horn-Muller\u2019s intriguing story at Grist about this new research. While advocates have hoped that states could be a bulwark against the new administration\u2019s anticipated assault on climate policy, early signs from Maryland are not entirely encouraging, Aman Azhar reports for Inside Climate News. Governor Wes Moore has already announced his intention to cut some climate spending\u2014particularly in programs receiving federal support that may soon be slashed. That\u2019s how much average homeowners\u2019 insurance premiums rose nationwide between 2020 and 2023, even prior to recent catastrophes like Hurricane Helene and the Los Angeles wildfires. In a First, the EPA Warns of \u201cForever Chemicals\u201d in Sludge Fertilizer If you haven\u2019t already read Molly Taft\u2019s remarkable story about PFAS in so-called biosolids fertilizer, made out of human waste\u2014and the people who realized the connection and are now fighting to limit the damage\u2014read that first. Then read the striking update that came on Tuesday. Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency released a study confirming what Maine officials have been warning people about for years: that this type of fertilizer can result in crop contamination wildly exceeding EPA safety thresholds. \u200b\u200bThe E.P.A. has for decades encouraged the use of sludge from treated wastewater as inexpensive fertilizer with no limits on how much PFAS it can contain. But the agency\u2019s new draft risk assessment sets a potential new course. If finalized, it could mark what could be the first step toward regulating PFAS in the sludge used as fertilizer, which the industry calls biosolids. The agency currently regulates certain heavy metals and pathogens in sewage sludge used as fertilizer, but not PFAS. Read Hiroko Tabuchi\u2019s full report at The New York Times.

It\u2019s a weird time for religion in the United States. Christians are on track to become a religious minority in the country within a few decades but also, soon, to wield incredible power in a second Trump administration\u2014thanks not least to a neo-Crusader defense secretary nominee, Christian nationalists likely leading the Office of Management and Budget as well as the House of Representatives, and an array of powerful Christian judges appointed in Trump\u2019s first term whose numbers will only grow in his second. Meanwhile, amid a devastatingly grim Advent season for other communities, Latino Christian leaders interviewed by Axios \u201csay they will unpack the Holy Family\u2019s immigration plight during Christmas services to offer hope for immigrants\u201d facing ICE raids and deportations in the new administration. White Protestants and Catholics voted by large margins for Trump; Black Protestants, Jews, atheists, and agnostics voted overwhelmingly against him. Muslim voters outraged by Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s slaughter in Gaza abandoned the Democrats at striking rates, many voting instead for Jill Stein. So while the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated or even nonreligious may be growing, the relevance of religion to politics clearly persists. And that means religion is relevant to climate change too. The Pew Research polls in 2022 found that moderately or highly religious people were much less likely to rate climate change as a serious problem than atheists were. But the surveys also showed huge numbers of religious people to be concerned. Growing numbers of religious leaders and groups\u2014even among white evangelicals\u2014are pushing for policies protecting the climate and environment. To learn about the contours of the growing religious advocacy for climate and environmental protection, I called up the Reverend Susan Hendershot, an ordained minister in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and president of Interfaith Power and Light, a group focused on engaging people of faith in environmental causes and climate action. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. How do you perceive your job in terms of engaging religious communities in climate advocacy? Interfaith Power and Light started in 2000 because our founder was seeing a disconnect between what she was hearing from environmental organizations, in terms of climate change and care for the earth, and the fact that she was not hearing that in her place of worship. For her, it became a mission to say that as faith communities, we are called to care for creation and we need to find ways to live that out: It\u2019s not just talking about it, it\u2019s doing something. From the start, there was a focus on greening houses of worship as an act of faith. So everything from energy efficiency upgrades to installing solar in houses of worship. And the other side of that has been the focus on policy advocacy, to say personal action is important and it gets us a certain way down the road as part of civil society, but unless we have the right policies in place, we can\u2019t actually make the progress that we need to make. It\u2019s centered on spiritual values and on the moral opportunity to take action\u2014to say people of faith are and should be leaders in working for climate and environmental justice. But this is focused on people from many different religious backgrounds, right? We say we work with people of all spiritual traditions and no spiritual traditions, recognizing that there are a lot of spiritual but not religious folks that are out there and that is a growing percentage. We want to make sure that there\u2019s a big tent out there that\u2019s for everyone who wants to take action from a place of spiritual values. Climate anxiety is on the rise. What does the lens of faith or spiritual values have to offer the climate fight, in your view? I see faith communities and leaders having three roles in the climate movement. The first one is pastoral, because there\u2019s a lot of climate anxiety and grief out there, whether it\u2019s people who have suffered from a climate disaster who are recovering and need a support system or young people who are considering whether they even want to have a family because do you want to bring children into a climate-changed world? So that pastoral role is really, really important. Faith leaders are trained to work with people who are suffering, grieving, in trauma. The second role I see as the practical role, which is offering leadership within their own faith community, working to move climate solutions forward in their houses of worship: renewable energy systems, energy efficiency, electric vehicles. Just serving as models in the community of what\u2019s possible. The third role is the prophetic role. We have to talk about this. One of the things Katharine Hayhoe says as a climate scientist and person of faith is that the most important thing you can do for climate change is to talk about it, because part of the problem is it\u2019s not being discussed enough. Pastors are called to use their prophetic voices in their places of worship to move people to action. How does the fragmentation of religious groups right now complicate your work? I\u2019m thinking about the very prominent evangelical voices allied with Trump who see fossil fuels as part of a kind of a nationalist vision. I like to use Yale Climate Communication\u2019s \u201cSix Americas\u201d study as an example. If you compare when they first started doing those studies to now, over time there has been an increase in the people who are alarmed and concerned about climate change and a really big decrease in those who are what we would call doubters. There are folks who have a lot of influence and power who are pushing fossil fuels and looking to continue to have an \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy\u2014we see that in the news media every day now\u2014but the reality I think is that for most folks on the ground, they are grappling with the real climate challenges that they\u2019re facing every day. It used to feel sort of far away, like you\u2019re talking about polar bears and ice caps. Now we\u2019re seeing floods and droughts, and farmers are seeing changes in their growing seasons for their crops. That makes it more real to people. I think those powerful voices pushing fossil fuels will be drowned out by the realities on the ground. So how do you envision people of faith being mobilized for climate policy advocacy? The Inflation Reduction Act was the result of many years of advocacy amongst people from all walks of life across the country, and this money is starting to make a real difference on the ground. There\u2019s a lot of money going into nonprofits, including houses of worship, who are installing solar and other energy efficiency systems and getting rid of their gas appliances and so on. One of the things that we found in our recent solar survey is that there are about 2,500 communities of faith around the country that have installed solar, with more coming through the direct pay mechanism with the IRA. We have a few congregations that have received their payment for direct pay, and many many more that have applied, and others that are in the exploratory phase. This trend is competitive with businesses like Starbucks and Walmart and all these other businesses that get a lot of attention around their solar installations. That\u2019s also happening on the consumer level\u2014faith communities are made up of people, many of whom have homes, and they\u2019re also looking for ways they can adapt, use this federal funding to make these improvements in their own homes that improve their lives, their bottom line, as well as the health of their families. The next piece of work is to protect what those incentives are and have done so that they won\u2019t be rolled back or clawed back. There\u2019s a lot of personal connection to that for folks, whether that\u2019s because they live near drilling sites and they don\u2019t want to see methane rules rolled back because it\u2019s improving the health and air quality in their community, or folks who are saying we don\u2019t want to roll back the direct pay portion of the IRA funding because that\u2019s a way that\u2019s helping faith communities install solar and be able to put more money into the mission and serve their communities. I think part of the opportunity here is to make those connections for individuals that are personal for them\u2014whatever that means for them or their family. The BBC has put together a list of \u201cseven quiet breakthroughs for climate and nature in 2024.\u201d They include the U.K. finally closing its last coal-fired power plant and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil falling to a nine-year low. Driven by the climate crisis, the country\u2019s home insurance problem is growing. Nonrenewal rates (that\u2019s when an insurance company drops a home that was previously covered) rose in 46 states in 2023, according to data obtained by the Senate Budget Committee. Read The New York Times\u2019 feature on this or check out their accompanying data visualization to see where insurers are dropping coverage in your state. That\u2019s the possible extra cost to American consumers of increasing liquefied natural gas exports (as the Trump administration plans to do), according to a new study released by the Department of Energy this week. It also found that the LNG exports could lead to an extra 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2050. As Clock Ticks to Act on the Climate Crisis, N.C. Activists Target a \u2018Carbon Plan\u2019 At Inside Climate News, Lisa Sorg profiles the activists fighting a longtime villain in the environmental justice movement, Duke Energy, which has released a \u201ccarbon plan\u201d that involves building numerous natural gas plants while keeping their coal plants open for years, completely missing the company\u2019s 2030 emissions-reduction goals. Some of these activists, like 74-year-old Bobby Jones, have been fighting Duke Energy for years. \u201cI know my children and grandchildren will not be the ones who can afford clean water and clean air,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey will be the ones relegated to cancer alleys. So I\u2019ve got to fight. And I\u2019ve got to encourage others to fight. Because we already see climate change. We don\u2019t have to wait for it to happen.\u201d Jones often thinks of the final words of [environmental justice advocate] John Gurley, as cancer had hollowed out his body. \u201cThe last conversation we had, we were talking about Duke Energy. And he said, \u2018Bobby, hold them accountable.\u2019\u201d Read Lisa Sorg\u2019s full report at Inside Climate News.

Two weeks ago, I wrote about the underappreciated and outsize significance of local environmental battles: small-town fights over development plans whose outcomes affect both the health of the community in question and the broader tallies of the energy transition. What do those look like in practice? This week, Bloomberg\u2019s lengthy feature on a fight over a new data center in Fayetteville, Georgia, offers a reminder that new iterations, new industries, and new face-offs are always right around the corner. Pipelines are some of the more famous and recognizable examples of how local fights come with national ramifications: The protests and legal challenges to the Dakota Access Pipeline have become an iconic symbol of Indigenous resistance to the fossil fuel projects that are damaging culturally and religiously significant sites and endangering water supplies. The cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in 2020 due to rising costs, after numerous marginalized communities along its planned route challenged the project in court and through protests, likewise became a case study in how local battles over the health and safety of a given community can affect emissions at the national level, as well: Some estimates suggested the ACP would have been responsible for emissions roughly equivalent to 20 new coal plants, while Clean Water for North Carolina calculated that the unintentional, leaked methane from the pipeline alone might increase the atmosphere-warming effect of national methane emissions by over 13 percent. Pipelines are far from the only example. For a different type of local environmental fight\u2014and one that confounded expectations of ordinary red-blue divides\u2014read Colin Jerolmack\u2019s piece a few years ago about predominantly conservative Grant Township\u2019s efforts to restrict fracking-related pollution, which escalated to the point that it put residents in conflict with state authorities. There have long been similar efforts underway against petrochemical plants. Larger philanthropic organizations and national nonprofits have only recently begun supporting the tireless efforts of local groups in Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCancer Alley,\u201d where numerous refineries, as well as chemical and plastic plants, are situated perilously close to the low-income, majority-Black communities where cancer rates are estimated to be 95 percent higher than in the rest of the country. New measurements taken this summer in southeastern Louisiana found levels of carcinogenic ethylene oxide in the air that were as much as 10 times higher than EPA-recommended limits. Then there are fights over concentrated animal feeding operations that, again, disproportionately pollute low-income, nonwhite communities while also contributing to land use problems, biodiversity crises, emissions, and more. Here too, the contours of environmental justice battles are ever evolving: The current hype around biogas\u2014a way for industrial meat producers to make money selling animal waste by-products for fuel\u2014and the tax incentives supporting it, have spawned new twists on old environmental fights over industrial agriculture. In May, NC Newsline reported a former mayor\u2019s dismay that, despite his town of Turkey, North Carolina, banning hog farms within city limits, a biogas plant using the very same hog waste the town had wanted to keep out was setting up shop just east of him: \u201cI never imagined they\u2019d bring the manure to us.\u201d On first glance, community opposition to a new data center might seem much different from these battles: The primary reason for opposition is not the near certainty of pollution that you get with these other installations. (As Nick Martin wrote at TNR in 2019, reviewing pipeline spill data, \u201cThe simple fact is that it is a matter of when, not if, a series micro-fractures or a loose bolt or a lightning strike will send the pipe\u2019s contents into the ground.\u201d) Yet look a bit closer, and familiar dynamics emerge. Data-center developer QTS and its new asset manager\u2013owner Blackstone, Inc., came in promising rural Fayetteville something simple: money. It\u2019s the same way that pipeline or biogas pitches to towns tend to start: with promises of economic benefit, including via jobs\u2014although the promised number of jobs often turns out to be exaggerated or only refer to temporary positions. In the case of Fayetteville\u2019s data center, \u201cthe portion of QTS\u2019s taxes going to the county board of education this year will cover the equivalent of some half a dozen teachers\u2019 salaries,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Dawn Lim and Josh Saul report. But in a manner similar to how these negotiations have played out with pipeline or fracking plans, the residents of Fayetteville quickly began to feel they had been misled. They say they were told the data center wouldn\u2019t need more electricity than what was already available from the local grid and could use \u201cexisting transmission lines.\u201d (QTS disputes this.) The actual power needed turned out to be about twice what one report suggested, with new power lines needing to be built. That\u2019s where the problems started. The power company serving the area, Georgia Power, then tried to secure new land for power lines, but residents weren\u2019t wild about being paid a couple grand in exchange for trees being cut down and giant new transmission lines being installed on their property. Georgia Power accordingly started offering much larger, six-figure sums of money. Now residents fear their neighbors are being bought off and that their lands could be \u201cseized\u201d by eminent domain if they themselves refuse. This small fight is part of a larger national\u2014and even global\u2014battle over the giant environmental costs of big tech and, specifically, new forms of artificial intelligence. The data center, Lim and Saul report, is part of Blackstone\u2019s quest to become \u201cthe largest financial investor in AI infrastructure.\u201d Microsoft, which like many tech companies is betting big on AI, will reportedly be one client for the new data center. Liza Featherstone wrote earlier this year about the enormous energy and water demands from AI data centers \u201cendangering the energy transition\u201d that is desperately needed to avert climate catastrophe. There\u2019s already evidence that AI energy demands are keeping high-polluting coal plants running past their planned retirement dates. While tech companies and their advocates have been quick to argue that AI tools could help meet environmental goals rather than derail them, an estimate this fall from Bain & Company suggested data centers for AI could make up 44 percent of U.S. electrical growth in coming years, requiring utilities \u201cto boost annual generation by up to 26% by 2028.\u201d Tech companies have been keen to insist that this demand can be met with new nuclear energy. But there isn\u2019t much evidence to suggest that this can be done in the short term\u2014and when it comes to the climate crisis, every additional day burning fossil fuels comes with steep costs. As Bloomberg\u2019s feature indicates, data centers are worth watching as a major emerging field for environmental battles, much like power plants and pipelines have been for decades. And while the industries may differ, these fights are likely to follow familiar patterns. Five young Hawaiian crows\u2014extinct in the wild\u2014were recently released in Maui, after careful raising and \u201canti-predator training\u201d using cats and owls. The once-frozen Arctic tundra is now releasing more carbon than it stores, due to thawing. That\u2019s how many fewer premature deaths per year we might have in this country if all households were to switch from fossil fuels to heat pumps and electric appliances, according to a new study. (This would also save $60 billion in energy bills each year and cut 400 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, according to The New York Times write-up, but it\u2019s the 300,000-ton drop in fine particulate matter that would make the big difference in saving lives.) CNN\u2019s Leah Dolan profiles Barbie-loving photographer Anastasia Samoylova, whose \u201csubtle, anxiety-inducing images of Florida\u2019s collapsing pastel-pink landscapes\u201d are suffused with an acute awareness of climate change. Samoylova moved to Florida in 2016, where she was struck by the state\u2019s severe weather events and aging infrastructure.\u2026 The insidious, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it approach to her observational photography is intentional. Several years of capturing political extremism, gentrification and environmental disintegration has given Samoylova time to think about how to package disastrous messaging. \u201cHow do you communicate these very complex subjects and make them relatable?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe trickiest part is to not make them off-putting.\u201d Come for the pink sidewalks that characterize the streets of Miami\u2014as many tourists do\u2014and stay for the subsequent feelings of existential dread. It\u2019s a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, she says. \u201c(Climate change) is stigmatized, and it\u2019s become divisive, at least where I live in the US, especially in Florida.

But I find it exhausting. Thanksgiving now heralds a multiweek stretch of increasingly frenetic marketing emails from people trying to destroy your budget, and \u201cGiving Tuesday\u201d just means that nonprofits join the fray, each competing against the next to offer the greatest sense of urgency and bang for buck in a world where there are too many crises and needs to count. Climate and environment groups participate perforce. (How can they not?) \u201cYOUR GIVING TUESDAY GIFT CAN SAVE OUR PLANET,\u201d Al Gore\u2013founded advocacy group Climate Reality Project told its supporters, adding that \u201cALL GIFTS WILL BE MATCHED.\u201d The Sierra Club replaced its home page with a dedicated Giving Tuesday landing page, announcing: \u201cIf we reach our 1,000 donor goal by midnight, we\u2019ll unlock a special $25,000 match for the environment.\u201d The pressure, the pressure! How do you choose where to give money and in what amounts without going broke? Wearyingly, there are now guides for that, not unlike Wirecutter\u2019s annual \u201cBest Black Friday Deals\u201d tracker. Many of them rely on data and recommendations from nonprofits that now exist to help people navigate nonprofits. Various organizations operating more or less explicitly according to the principles of so-called \u201ceffective altruism\u201d (championed by such techbro luminaries as the now-incarcerated Sam Bankman-Fried) promise a \u201csystematic approach to try and determine where the high leverage points are in climate philanthropy\u2014and by high-leverage, I\u2019m thinking most greenhouse gas reductions per dollar,\u201d in the words of Giving Green director Daniel Stein, speaking with Heatmap last week. Experts could probably haggle over the methodology of such enterprises for years. Rather than get into the finer details of this philosophical debate or a practical one about the rankings that result, I want to point out another option for optimizing your \u201cbang for buck\u201d for the many people of limited means but concerned hearts. It lies in what you don\u2019t give your money to: If you are the sort of person inclined to donate online on Giving Tuesday, you are probably somebody with a bank. And by switching away from a bank that finances fossil fuels, or by simply switching from one of the bigger offenders to a local credit union, you have the ability to extend your \u201cimpact\u201d even if you don\u2019t have the means to send large sums to exhaustively researched \u201cevidence-backed\u201d charities. The Banking On Climate Chaos Report has found that JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are among the top financers of fossil fuels worldwide. Bank of America recently even walked back its pledge to stop financing new coal projects. Despite the right-wing fantasy that the finance industry is engaged in a discriminatory \u201cconspiracy\u201d against fossil fuels, most financial firms continue to direct a lot of money toward environmentally catastrophic enterprises. It took me longer than I\u2019d like to admit to begin the process of switching banks; like most people with organizational difficulties, I have developed a well-founded fear of fouling up the fine print or forgetting to change an autopay setting and somehow destroying my life through sheer logistical mismanagement. Pearl Marvell\u2019s piece for Yale Climate Connections last February about how she herself made the switch\u2014along with useful information from experts, tools for determining your bank\u2019s climate-friendliness, and databases of banks to choose from according to your criteria\u2014is what pushed me from dithering into actually doing it. In case it needs emphasizing, this newsletter does not constitute any kind of financial or investment advice, nor is it intended to singlehandedly address the entanglement of capital with the climate crisis by convincing a few TNR readers to exercise their consumer choice. Switching out all your finances at once can be tricky; people have limited control over employer-sponsored retirement accounts, for example. (And certainly there are banks out there charging exorbitant fees for minor infractions that you\u2019d be wise to avoid\u2014although luckily many databases now allow you to select for banks that don\u2019t do that.) But this option may be more practical for some people than trying to stretch an already stretched budget and agonizing about where to donate. If we\u2019re really going to go about beating our chests about \u201coptimizing\u201d our do-gooder impulses and extracting maximum \u201cleverage,\u201d then removing a bank\u2019s ability to use the money you have in your accounts year-round to help fund fossil fuel projects is probably going to outweigh donating $25 or even $100 once a year to a carefully selected green effective altruism fund. Psychologically, switching banks wasn\u2019t as chaotic and disruptive as I\u2019d feared. After keeping the old one open for several extra months to ensure there weren\u2019t any automatic bills I\u2019d forgotten about, I\u2019m closing it later this month. It\u2019s nice to know that money I receive from a day job dealing with the climate crisis isn\u2019t being used to fuel that crisis while I sleep. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the two smaller banks my family has switched to offer better interest rates and are way easier to deal with than the endless bureaucracy of my old bank. So far it\u2019s a lot like switching away from a gas stove\u2014after the initial logistical inconvenience has passed, it\u2019s just a much nicer way of living. Electrifying and decarbonizing require copper\u2014but high-quality reserves are limited and the extraction process is extremely toxic and emissions-intensive. Grist has an intriguing report on new technologies being developed to make the process less environmentally destructive. Even if you were already aware of the dangers of formaldehyde pollution\u2014an alarming amount of it coming from basic home furnishings\u2014this ProPublica piece on the extent of the problem, and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s failure to tackle it, is going to hit very hard. That\u2019s how much money from the EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program has yet to be awarded, leaving it \u201cvulnerable to reversal efforts from Trump officials or Republican lawmakers,\u201d Inside Climate News reports. No, the Fight for the Climate Isn\u2019t \u201cOver\u201d Historian Kevin Young\u2019s new piece over at Jacobin is an intriguing entry in the emerging genre offering reasons for climate followers to have a degree of hope heading into the second Trump era. Despondent leftists have a distorted view of how the first Trump presidency actually played out, Young suggests. Environmentalists secured a number of crucial victories\u2014and understanding precisely how that happened can help activists identify the most promising paths going forward: Despite Trump\u2019s best efforts, some of the US climate movement\u2019s most notable recent victories happened on his watch. More coal-fired power plant capacity was retired in the United States from 2017 to 2020 than from 2013 to 2016. That\u2019s right: the coal industry took a bigger hit under a president who campaigned on reviving it than under a president who was supposedly waging war on it. Notice how Trump rarely mentions coal anymore? The reason is that coal\u2019s fate depends only marginally on national politicians. Since the early 2000s, hundreds of local environmental groups, acting largely independently of the big national organizations, have made it much harder for coal plants to be built or remain in operation. The natural gas boom has also undermined coal, but the market shift has been amplified by the movement.\u2026 Trump suffered many quieter defeats too. His efforts to enact extra subsidies for coal and nuclear energy, to expand offshore oil drilling, to end tax credits for the wind industry, and to force banks to fund drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge all were blocked.\u2026 It\u2019s important to understand how we played that role. It wasn\u2019t through the unfocused outrage of occasional mass marches nor through lobbying or electing Democrats. We were most powerful when we put sustained, disruptive pressure on capitalists and state elites whose interests diverged from Trump\u2019s. Read Kevin Young\u2019s full essay at Jacobin.

        "title": "Trump Brutally Fact-Checked on Gripe Already Debunked to His Face | The New Republic",
        "text": "Donald Trump has now been brutally fact-checked by two different world leaders over his incessant whining about getting a payday from war-torn Ukraine. During a joint press conference Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump was once again complaining that the U.S. had been scammed into sending billions in military aid to Ukraine, while other nations were making their money back. \u201cWe wanted to have a little bit of what the European nations had,\u201d Trump griped. \u201cYou know, they get their money back by giving money, we don\u2019t get the money back. Biden made a deal, he put in $350 billion, and I thought it was a very unfair situation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours,\u201d Starmer interjected. \u201cI mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given.\u201d Trump: They get their money back by giving money. We don't get the money back. I thought it was a very unfair situation.Starmer: We're not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. pic.twitter.com/oXuFZpZdu8 Starmer\u2019s correction was nearly identical to a fact-check from French President Emmanuel Macron\u00a0 during a press conference Monday, when he was also forced to push back against the grievance-addled U.S. president\u2019s false claims that Europe was simply \u201cloaning\u201d their money to Ukraine. \u201cNo, in fact, to be frank. We paid,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe paid 60 percent of the total effort, and it was through, like the U.S., loans, guarantee, grants, and we provided real money, to be clear.\u201d Macron had emphasized that Ukraine ought to be compensated by Russia for the deaths of citizens and destruction of property. Trump\u2019s obsession with getting paid back for America\u2019s supposedly humanitarian and military assistance has become a central feature of his efforts to resolve Russia\u2019s deadly invasion of Ukraine. Never mind how strange it is to demand payment for emergency aid in the first place. U.S. and Ukraine officials entered the final stages of a contentious mineral agreement, which would funnel half of the Eastern European nation\u2019s rare earth minerals\u2014hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of materials\u2014into the American market. The deal would serve to pay back some of what the U.S. spent but wouldn\u2019t do anything to ensure Ukraine\u2019s security or economic interests in the future. Trump has expressed hostility toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claiming he was enjoying the \u201cgravy train\u201d of U.S. aid and calling him a \u201cdictator.\u201d But on Thursday, Trump claimed he didn\u2019t remember saying that. The official social media account for the House Judiciary GOP rickrolled the Epstein files on Thursday. On the heels of a political stunt in which the Trump administration gifted large binders labeled \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase One\u201d to a cadre of MAGA influencers, Republicans in office suddenly decided it would be kosher to use the abhorrent sex trafficking case to make a quick joke. \u201c#BREAKING: EPSTEIN FILES RELEASED,\u201d the official X account for the House Judiciary GOP posted alongside a shortened URL that actually directed users to Rick Astley\u2019s music video for \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d The disgusting gimmick appalled users on the social media platform, some of whom were shocked that the Republican Party would risk the American public\u2019s cybersecurity by sending them down an unknown web address to access highly coveted, classified information. \u201cSending the American people to a tiny url that redirects to an unknown destination is a great way to ensure trust in the cybersecurity domain,\u201d posted one user. For years, Jeffrey Epstein orchestrated a child sex trafficking ring in which he raped countless young girls and helped his wealthy and famous affiliates do the same. He allegedly killed himself in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Earlier this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged to release the details of Epstein\u2019s flight logs as well as a list of his connections to the public by Thursday, though that still has not happened. \u201cThe \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 are something of a white whale for the QAnon wing of MAGA, as they believe that its release would reveal the villainous liberal cabal that secretly coordinates international child sex trafficking,\u201d wrote The New Republic\u2019s Malcolm Ferguson. \u201cMany in the conspiracy community believe that Epstein\u2019s death\u2014and the botched release of this list\u2014is part of a greater \u2018deep state\u2019 coverup.\u201d So the White House\u2019s gag earlier in the day, unsurprisingly, ruffled feathers on the far right. After some MAGA talking heads\u2014including DC Draino\u2019s Rogan O\u2019Handley, Libs of TikTok\u2019s Chaya Raichik, Liz Wheeler, and Mike Cernovich\u2014refused to share the contents of the binders after waltzing out of the executive office, others on the right were left screaming and scrambling online for actual details related to Epstein\u2019s activities. \u201cTHERE ARE NO EPSTEIN FILES!!!\u201d Laura Loomer claimed on X. \u201cTHE BINDERS ARE PROPS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RIGHT WING PAID INFLUENCERS LIED TO ALL OF YOU TODAY! THEY ENGAGED IN DECEPTION TO RUN COVER FOR PEDOPHILES!!! THEY POSTED SELFIES WITH PROP BINDERS! LIARS AND DECEIVERS.\u201d Donald Trump awkwardly joked to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer about hanging his country out to dry in a war against Russia, leaving the close U.S. ally speechless. During a joint press conference Thursday, Starmer was describing the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom as \u201cthe greatest alliance for prosperity and security\u201d that the world had ever seen. \u201cWhenever necessary, we\u2019ve absolutely backed each other up\u2014\u201d Starmer said, before the president interjected. \u201cCould you take on Russia by yourselves?\u201d Trump asked, turning to Starmer. \u201cWell, heh,\u201d said Starmer laughing. Trump broke into a smile, laughing along with the press. \u201cAlright, one or two more,\u201d Trump said, changing the subject. Trump asks Starmer if the UK could take on Russia on its own pic.twitter.com/mtstLVReLF Trump\u2019s unsettling joke comes as the all-too-eager U.S. president and Russian President Vladimir Putin cozy up together, amid high-stakes negotiations to end Russia\u2019s deadly invasion of Ukraine\u2014showing just how willing the Trump administration is to throw its allies to the dogs at Moscow\u2019s command. Starmer\u2019s visit led to several bumpy moments between the two world leaders. At one point, Trump hinted at a tense discussion between himself and Starmer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been terrific in our discussions. You\u2019re a very tough negotiator, however. I\u2019m not sure I like that\u2014but that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said. At another point, when asked to respond to Trump\u2019s comments about making Canada the fifty-first state, Starmer tried to reply, before being forcefully cut off by the president. \u201cYou mentioned Canada. I think you\u2019re trying to find a divide between us that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re the closest of nations, and we had very good discussions today, but we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Trump interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Thank you.\u201d Last month, Elon Musk set his sights on unseating Starmer, consulting with his right-wing allies to devise a strategy to oust the Labour Party\u2019s leader. The president of the United States begged a Fox News anchor to tell viewers that he\u2019s doing a \u201cgood job.\u201d Shortly after the end of his first Cabinet meeting\u2014which saw Elon Musk loom over a room of practically mum agency heads\u2014Trump was caught on an Associated Press live feed suggesting to Fox & Friends host Lawrence Jones that the journalist tell America the meeting went off without a hitch. \u201cLawrence! Look at Lawrence! This guy\u2019s making a fortune! He never had it so good,\u201d Trump shouted over the table shortly after the Wednesday meeting ended. \u201cLawrence, say we did a great job, please. OK? Say it was unbelievable,\u201d Trump added right before the AP\u2019s feed cut off. Trump Caught On Hot Mic Telling Fox Host To Praise Cabinet Meeting As Press Files Out: 'Say It Was Unbelievable!' https://t.co/UXwhVkZtxW via @mediaite pic.twitter.com/jvzzQdcvj6 The embarrassing request echoed another major political flub from 2016, when Republican presidential primary candidate Jeb Bush pleaded with a crowd at one of his rallies to \u201cplease clap.\u201d Trump\u2019s stunning appeal came after Jones used his time with the president to ask several vanilla questions, including which of his Cabinet members was his favorite, and whether the administration should fire all the generals involved in the Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Trump said of the Afghanistan plan, before facing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that if I had his place, I\u2019d fire every single one of them.\u201d But the president\u2019s plea to his favorite network comes on the heels of a flurry of attacks by his administration against the press at large. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the administration would take control of the White House press pool, hand-selecting which outlets are allowed access to the president and possibly replacing reporters from legacy publications with right-wing podcasters. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which has handled press pool coverage since its founding in 1914, said that the decision \u201ctears at the independence of a free press.\u201d And earlier this month, the Trump administration banned the Associated Press from accessing Air Force One and the Oval Office on the basis that the newswire chose to continue referring to the recently renamed \u201cGulf of America\u201d as the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d for its global audience. The Trump administration\u2019s plan to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein appears to have been nothing more than a poorly disguised public relations scheme that has the MAGA fringe infuriated. On Thursday, a cadre of MAGA influencers\u2014DC Draino\u2019s Rogan O\u2019Handley, Libs of TikTok\u2019s Chaya Raichik, Liz Wheeler, and Mike Cernovich\u2014marched out of the White House smiling and waving glossy white binders labeled \u201cThe Epstein Files: Phase 1.\u201d But Attorney General Pam Bondi had promised to release to the public both Epstein\u2019s flight logs and the names of people tied to the disgraced financier on Thursday. That still hasn\u2019t happened\u2014infuriating MAGA Republicans in Congress. \u201cI nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today.\u2026 A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein\u2019s phonebook,\u201d MAGA Representative Anna Paulina Luna noted on X. \u201cTHIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!\u201d \u201c1) If the Epstein files are out, where do we find them? (2) What\u2019s the difference between \u2018phase 1\u2019 and \u2018phase 2\u2019?\u201d asked Senator Mike Lee. \u201cWill the Epstein files tell us whether he killed himself?\u201d he asked later. \u201cTHERE ARE NO EPSTEIN FILES!!!\u201d MAGA talking head Laura Loomer raged on X. \u201cTHE BINDERS ARE PROPS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RIGHT WING PAID INFLUENCERS LIED TO ALL OF YOU TODAY! THEY ENGAGED IN DECEPTION TO RUN COVER FOR PEDOPHILES!!! THEY POSTED SELFIES WITH PROP BINDERS! LIARS AND DECEIVERS.\u201d Epstein raped an untold number of young girls for years on his private island and killed himself in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking of minors. The \u201cEpstein files\u201d are something of a white whale for the QAnon wing of MAGA, as they believe that their release would reveal the villainous liberal cabal that secretly coordinates international child sex trafficking. Many in the conspiracy community believe that Epstein\u2019s death\u2014and the botched release of this list\u2014is part of a greater \u201cdeep state\u201d cover-up. \u201cSkip to the end: The celebrities that your Facebook uncle says are on the Epstein List are not in any of the documents, and the story becomes \u2018the deep state purged the documents,\u2019\u201d wrote Semafor\u2019s David Wiegel. By Thursday afternoon, Bondi claimed the FBI refused to hand over \u201cthousands of pages\u201d on the Epstein files and the real drop will happen on Friday, February 28. The Trump administration is having trouble bringing back fired avian flu experts to take on the spread of the disease, which has caused egg prices to skyrocket. Earlier this month, the administration fired 25 percent of the employees in an office testing for avian flu, as well as scientists and inspectors, as part of its mass purge of federal workers. The layoffs partially shut down a research facility at the Department of Agriculture, interrupting anti-bird flu efforts. Administration officials are attempting to tout a $1 billion plan to combat the disease, as well as plans to import eggs from overseas. But that plan doesn\u2019t include bringing back fired avian flu workers, whom the USDA is struggling to rehire. The agency is running into logistical issues as well as skeptical ex-employees, some of whom aren\u2019t convinced they should return as Trump and Elon Musk continue to fire federal workers indiscriminately. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are going to want to come back,\u201d one anonymous USDA employee told Politico. \u201cNow there\u2019s this perception that federal jobs are not secure. I think they permanently damaged these services.\u201d USDA supervisors have also been told to justify every bird flu employee being rehired, and some employees who have come back still don\u2019t have laptop computers. It\u2019s not clear if all of the fired avian flu employees have been asked to come back, and some of the reinstated workers were even sent emails urging them to take the Trump administration\u2019s deferred resignation plan, according to two sources. \u201cRather than measure twice and cut once, it\u2019s more like everyone is on the chopping block and then, \u2018Oh shit we cut the wrong people,\u2019\u201d a USDA employee told Politico. This could be the first test of how the Trump administration handles a crisis with Musk wielding so much power within the government. Will Trump and Musk prioritize the need to combat the disease, prevent a potential pandemic, and safeguard the country? Or will they stubbornly continue to claim achievements while they gut crucial parts of the government? Elon Musk suddenly wants to increase the size of the federal workforce. \u201cThere is a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X Thursday. \u201cIf you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so.\u201d Musk\u2019s desperate call to bring retired federal employees back into the fray after single-handedly undermining the security of every single government job is inane on its face. It gets even more so when considering the actual requirements for the job. Individuals interested in becoming an air traffic controller must be younger than 31 years of age to apply for the position, according to the Federal Aviation Administration website. Air traffic controllers are permitted to serve in the position until they are 56 years old. So, it\u2019s immediately unclear how Musk\u2019s plan to lure retirees back would even be possible. Although the solution proposed by the unelected bureaucrat is decidedly unserious, the problem straining air traffic control towers is anything but. The New York Times reported in 2023 that nearly every air traffic control site in the country was understaffed, leading to the staffers in the high-stress position being overworked. After a deadly plane crash at the Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., earlier this month, the Times reported that its air traffic control tower had a staff of 19 controllers\u2014as opposed to the 30 recommended by the FAA and controllers\u2019 union. As of September 2024, the FAA had 14,000 air traffic controllers in its employ, having surpassed its yearly goal to bring aboard 1,800 new hires. The hiring spree was implemented to reverse a \u201cdecades-long air traffic controller staffing level decline,\u201d according to a post from the FAA. But earlier this month, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping layoffs, a whopping 400 FAA jobs were eliminated. According to the Trump administration, none of them were air traffic controllers. \u201cOn the layoffs, these were probationary employees\u2014meaning they had only been at the FAA for less than two years, represented less than 1 percent of FAA\u2019s more than 45,000 employees,\u201d said Department of Transportation spokesperson Halee Dobbins. Last month, Trump issued an executive order to \u201cimmediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring\u201d at the FAA, claiming that it \u201cprioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency.\u201d Elon Musk may be throwing his weight around the federal government, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet are happy about it. Trump\u2019s aides are reportedly struggling to contain internal administration disputes after Musk threatened mass layoffs over the weekend for federal employees who refused to submit a progress report to the Department of Government Efficiency, Reuters reported Thursday. Responding to the president\u2019s request that he become \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in sizing down the federal government, Musk wrote in a social media post Saturday that all federal employees must self-report five things that they achieved in the previous week before midnight on Monday, or else they would face immediate termination. Federal workers reportedly received an email from the Office of Personnel Management shortly afterward that echoed Musk\u2019s post. But by Monday, many federal agencies fronted by Trump\u2019s own appointees had simply told their staffers not to respond. Those included the Department of Defense, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the agency that issued the directive: the Office of Personnel Management. The notice to ignore Musk reportedly came as a shocking reversal in the White House, which had been under the impression before the weekend that internal relations between Musk and the rest of Trump\u2019s senior staffers were improving after Musk had agreed to loop White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in on his plans, Reuters reported earlier this month. But Trump and Wiles did not sign off on the email, according to three sources that spoke on the condition of anonymity with the newswire, despite Musk\u2019s assurance during Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting that the president had given him the OK. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Reuters\u2019s sources were \u201cwrong,\u201d that Trump had signed off on the idea, that DOGE and OPM had given the White House advance notice of the email\u2019s release, and that the \u201cWhite House was not caught off guard.\u201d Massive cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs that would have had devastating effects for veterans were paused late Wednesday. Lawmakers and veterans\u2019 organizations protested over concerns that the cuts would have hurt critical veterans\u2019 health services. On Tuesday, VA Secretary Doug Collins had bragged the department was merely slashing consulting deals to the tune of $2 billion. \u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins said in an X post Tuesday. In reality, the 875 contracts on the chopping block dealt with everything from assessing veterans\u2019 exposure to toxic materials to cancer treatment. On Wednesday, a VA spokesperson sought to backtrack, saying in a statement that its review of department contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d \u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in the statement. One of the targeted contracts had to do with reviewing veterans\u2019 disability ratings, a critical step needed for a veteran to qualify for medical coverage and draw medical compensation if they were injured due to their military service. If a veteran doesn\u2019t receive an accurate rating, they could end up getting worse financial support and treatment options. According to an internal VA email, one contracting official in the agency said that the Department of Government Efficiency said it was targeting \u201cconsulting\u201d contracts, but in reality, the cuts included chemotherapy and imaging services. Other contracts that would have been axed included radiation detection equipment, cancer care support, veterans\u2019 cemetery management, and the ability to assess toxic exposure. \u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360, told the AP. The organization advocates for veterans who suffer from respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure from trash-burning fires near military bases overseas. There\u2019s no guarantee that the planned cuts aren\u2019t suddenly resurrected. President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to slash what they call fraud, waste, and abuse from the federal government has largely been haphazard, resulting in multiple cases where they had to undo the firing of critical staff or the cancellation of lifesaving programs, such as some at the VA. In some cases, cuts haven\u2019t been reversed despite promises otherwise, and whether money is even being saved is debatable at best. The question is how many lives have been ruined by Musk and Trump just a month into this presidency. Donald Trump screamed Republican Representative Victoria Spartz into submission on his disastrous budget bill, Puck reported Thursday. The Indiana congresswoman, one of the three initial holdouts on the reconciliation bill, claimed Wednesday she was a \u201chard no\u201d on the resolution, which would force the Committee on Energy and Commerce to reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion from 2025 to 2034. That committee oversees Medicaid, sparking widespread concerns that Republicans were simply seeking a way to slash the crucial program. When asked by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju whether she would bend to pressure from her colleagues, Spartz replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough.\u2026 You should know better than that by now. \u201cWe cannot be weak, and we have to do the right thing for the people,\u201d she said. But that was before Spartz took a furious phone call from the president, whose screaming could be heard by the congresswoman\u2019s colleagues across the Republican cloakroom, according to Puck. Trump shouted that Spartz was a fake Republican set on undermining his agenda, and loudly reminded Spartz that he was the president, Puck reported. As a freshly scolded Spartz walked out of the cloakroom, Mike Johnson patted her on the back. \u201cYou know what you have to do,\u201d the House speaker said. Spartz flipped, telling reporters later that she\u2019d had a \u201cgreat conversation\u201d with Trump, who was \u201con board to get some great things done on health care.\u201d \u201cI trust his word,\u201d she told reporters. It seems like Spartz doesn\u2019t know Trump well enough and should know better than that by now. Trump claimed after his Cabinet meeting Wednesday that he was \u201cnot going to touch\u201d Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security. But without severe slashing to federal programs, Republicans will fail to accumulate the savings required to offset the cost of the tax breaks imposed by the budget bill. Representative Warren Davidson also flipped from \u201cnay\u201d to \u201cyay\u201d after a call from Trump. In the end, the only Republican holdout was Representative Thomas Massie.",

        "title": "On a pause from genocide, Israel turns its focus to ethnic cleansing | Occupied West Bank | Al Jazeera",
        "text": "After slaughtering tens of thousands in Gaza, Israel embarked on a forced displacement campaign in the West Bank. Neither proved severe enough to curb Europe\u2019s enthusiasm for collaboration. On Sunday, February 23, Israel deployed tanks in the occupied West Bank for the first time in more than two decades. It was the latest in a series of bellicose stunts that escalated in January, in tandem with the implementation of the tenuous ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. Of course, the inherently long-term nature of Israel\u2019s genocidal policy in Gaza means that any ceasefire is inevitably temporary. In the 15-month assault on the Palestinian enclave that began in October 2023, the Israeli military officially killed at least 48,365 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children \u2013 although the true death toll is undoubtedly far higher. Most of Gaza\u2019s inhabitants were displaced by the Israeli onslaught, many of them more than once. Now, The Times of Israel reports that more than 40,100 Palestinians in West Bank refugee camps like Jenin have \u201cfled their homes\u201d since January 21, which is \u201callegedly the largest displacement in the territory since the Six Day War in 1967\u201d. And on Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the army to prepare for an \u201cextended presence in the cleared camps for the next year, and not to allow the return of residents\u201d. Anyway, there\u2019s nothing like ethnic cleansing to pave the way for annexation, the chief fantasy of the Israeli right wing. The thoroughly illegal scheme may also soon be receiving an explicit endorsement from United States President Donald Trump, who remarked in early February: \u201cPeople do like the idea, but we haven\u2019t taken a position on it yet.\u201d On Monday \u2013 one day after Israel\u2019s deployment of tanks in the West Bank and Katz\u2019s de facto ethnic cleansing announcement \u2013 the European Union and Israel held the 13th meeting in Brussels of the EU-Israel Association Council, attended by representatives of all 27 EU states and co-chaired by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar. In theory, the meeting would have been a timely opportunity to call Israel out on mass forced displacement and ongoing slaughter in the West Bank \u2013 not to mention, you know, genocide in Gaza. Three days prior to the Brussels rendezvous, Israeli forces fatally shot two Palestinian children in the back near Jenin and Hebron, respectively. Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement specifies that \u201crelations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles.\u201d And it was this article that was invoked in February 2024 by the leaders of Spain and Ireland, who called for a review of whether Israel was violating the agreement\u2019s human rights obligations. But at Monday\u2019s meeting with Sa\u2019ar, it was clear that the EU \u2013 Israel\u2019s largest trading partner \u2013 was more concerned with preserving its association with a country guilty of all manner of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the official pre-meeting \u201cnote\u201d regarding the EU position, the General Secretariat of the EU-Israel Association Council started by emphasizing that \u201cthe EU attaches great significance to its close relations with the State of Israel.\u201d A lot more kissing of Israel\u2019s backside ensues throughout the remainder of the 28-page PDF document, with the EU alternately expressing \u201cits full solidarity and support to Israel and its people\u201d and identifying Israel as a \u201ckey partner for cooperation\u201d in numerous areas. The note underscores how much the EU \u201clooks forward\u201d to working with Israel to \u201caddress global challenges\u201d as well as to \u201caccelerate the world shift to a secure and just food system\u201d \u2013 a pretty rich task to assign the folks who were just using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. This is not to say that the Europeans have not managed a single critique of Israel in 28 pages. The note takes care to mention that \u201cthe EU deeply deplores the unacceptable number of civilians, especially women and children, who have lost their lives\u201d in Gaza; that \u201cthe EU recalls that annexation is illegal under international law\u201d; and that \u201cthe EU remains gravely concerned about the extensive recourse by Israel to indiscriminate arrests and administrative detention without formal charge.\u201d But any substantive condemnation is ultimately drowned out by the fact that Europe is just so darn excited to cooperate with Israel, now and forevermore. The statement also informs us that \u201cthe EU is gravely concerned that the occupation of the Palestinian territory that began in 1967 continues to this day,\u201d and repeatedly reiterates support for a two-state solution. And yet it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how, exactly, an end to occupation is supposed to come about, when the state that\u2019s not only doing the occupying but also endeavouring to disappear the Palestinian people is being hailed as an awesome regional partner. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Israeli Foreign Minister Sa\u2019ar defended Israel\u2019s current campaign of forced displacement in the West Bank, which has entailed widespread killing by the army and illegal settlers as well as house demolitions: \u201cIt\u2019s military operations taking place there against terrorists, and no other objectives but that.\u201d To be sure, the good old anti-terror excuse never fails to justify Israel\u2019s perpetual terrorisation of Palestinians. At the start of Israel\u2019s West Bank escalation in January, Defense Minister Katz also trotted out the T-word to explain how Israel was now applying \u201cthe first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza\u201d by subjecting Jenin to \u201ca powerful operation to eliminate terrorists and terror infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over\u201d. Indeed, Israel\u2019s West Bank operations are but an extension of the genocidal approach to Gaza, with mass slaughter and displacement transpiring with full US and European complicity \u2013 minus the intermittent lip service paid to Palestinian rights. It remains to be seen whether Trump will now propose a \u201cDead Sea Riviera\u201d in the West Bank to rival his vision of the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d, which will supposedly spring forth from the ruins of the Gaza Strip once the US wrests control of the territory and expels the native population. In the meantime, Israel\u2019s crimes against humanity will continue to be normalised by the country\u2019s \u201ckey partners for cooperation\u201d across the globe, while genocide is increasingly relegated to the realm of non-news. And that, frankly, is a crime against humanity itself. The views expressed in this article are the authors\u2019 own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.

When Elon Musk brandished a chain saw at a Republican conference over the weekend, he said it was coming \u201cfor bureaucracy.\u201d But Democrats in Virginia say his chain saw could slash Republicans\u2019 chances at a different target: the governor\u2019s mansion in Richmond. The Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative to cut up to $2 trillion in federal spending led by billionaire Mr. Musk, has promised federal layoffs to achieve that goal. Thousands of federal employees have already been fired, and more cuts are coming: A memo issued Wednesday by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management instructed department and agency heads to prepare for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d and to develop reorganization plans by March 13. And Virginia, one of the few states to hold elections this fall, will be disproportionately affected. The governor\u2019s race in Virginia is often seen as a harbinger of national political trends. This year, the fallout from Department of Government Efficiency layoffs is shaking up the race as Republicans try to retain power and Democrats cite surging interest. The commonwealth is home to one of the country\u2019s largest federal workforces, behind only Washington, D.C., and California. Most of the state\u2019s federal employees and contractors live in the counties surrounding the nation\u2019s capital. But there is also a sizable military presence in the southeast corner of the state, which could be impacted by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth\u2019s own recent request for budget cuts. Democratic leaders say the layoffs will be felt throughout the state, as friends and family members lose their jobs and trigger a domino effect through Virginia\u2019s economy, just as the state\u2019s elections are heating up. Virginia\u2019s off-year elections are always anticipated by politicos who read the results as a report card on a new presidential administration and a bellwether for the following year\u2019s midterm elections. And this year the commonwealth will again be heavily analyzed, as Democrats try to rebound after a disastrous 2024 election and take back the governorship they lost in 2021. That defeat came, in part, because the Democratic nominee, Terry McAuliffe, underperformed in the northern Virginia suburbs compared with former President Biden\u2019s 2020 margins. With DOGE, Republicans in Washington may have motivated a subset of voters in the neighboring state who could tip the electoral scales in Democrats\u2019 favor. After all, more than 144,000 federal employees live in Virginia, while Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won in 2021 by fewer than 64,000 votes. \u201cWe are so used to talking about national politics at a 30,000-foot level where it\u2019s all theoretical, and we don\u2019t see and feel the impact,\u201d says Dominic Thompson, executive director of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee. \u201c[The firings] are not just a theoretical thing here in northern Virginia. There are federal workers all over the place. \u2026 Every single person up here is talking about this.\u201d Just earlier this week, for example, Mr. Thompson was at Starbucks and said that he heard his barista talking about how one of her friends was fired from the U.S. Agency for International Development. For Jeff Person, chair of the Falls Church Democrats, the layoffs have been personal: His sister moved her family to Dakar, Senegal, in the fall for a job with USAID. She was officially placed on leave this week. At the Arlington Democrats\u2019 February meeting, which their Democratic congressman attended to discuss the cuts, close to 400 people \u2013 more than five times the typical crowd size \u2013 attended either in person or virtually, says Chair Steve Baker. Located just across the Potomac River from Washington, Arlington is home to about 28,000 federal employees and contractors. The Arlington Democrats hosted a town hall for federal workers this past week at a local library where they were invited to share their stories. It was standing room only with an overflow crowd in the hallway. \u201cThis cuts across partisan lines, certainly in the suburbs,\u201d says Mr. Baker. \u201cFederal workers are coming out in droves looking for any kind of support they can find,\u201d says Mr. Thompson. \u201cOur party hears them, and they\u2019ll remember that when November comes around.\u201d Virginia Republicans are aware of what the cuts would mean for their state: They have offered their own support for workers, while also showing their support for the Trump administration and DOGE\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the federal government downsizing is wrong, and in fact, we need to press forward and drive efficiencies in our federal government,\u2019\u2019 said Governor Youngkin at an event in Tysons Corner on Monday where he launched a new job initiative in the state. \u201cAnd as a result of driving those efficiencies, I do expect that some Virginians will lose their jobs.\u2019\u2019 Through a new website called \u201cVirginia Has Jobs,\u201d workers impacted by the \u201cfederal government transition\u201d can sign up for virtual job fairs and apply for unemployment benefits. The site also has links to LinkedIn and Indeed job listings and tips for how workers can update their resumes. (\u201cFederal resumes are often lengthy. ... Aim for 1\u20132 pages for the private sector.\u201d) \u201cI am glad that President Trump is getting to the bottom of all of this,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running to be the Republican gubernatorial nominee against former Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, at a campaign event in Bowling Green last week. Like Mr. Youngkin, she suggested that Virginia\u2019s private sector job opportunities could absorb the blow. But Ms. Earle-Sears\u2019 allegiance to DOGE has been challenged. Earlier this week a former Loudoun County delegate, Dave LaRock, filed papers to challenge Ms. Earle-Sears for the Republican nomination, promising to create a \u201cVaDOGE\u201d \u2013 \u201ca bold initiative\u201d aimed at cutting waste and \u201creducing bureaucracy\u201d at the state level. Republicans are offering nothing more than a \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d approach, says Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Virginia Democratic Party. Their response, through the Virginia Has Jobs website, is something that \u201ca career coach would be fired for.\u201d Democrats have painted Republicans\u2019 response as coldly pragmatic, blindly following the will of the president. A new ad from the Virginia House Democratic Caucus entitled \u201cChaos,\u201d which targets 12 Republican-held districts, repeatedly shows images of Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump. Democrats hope to hold onto, or even build on, the narrow majorities they won in both houses of the General Assembly in 2021, despite losing the governorship. But Ms. Swecker attributes much of Democrats\u2019 2021 gubernatorial loss to what she calls \u201cthe White House curse.\u201d For decades, the party that won the White House went on to lose Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election the following year, save for 2013 when Mr. McAuliffe, a Democrat, won his first term as governor. Prompting Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s trend-bucking win, says Matthew Hurtt, Chairman of the Arlington County GOP, was the October 2013 government shutdown. Because of a budget impasse in Congress, as Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz tried to defund the Affordable Care Act, the federal government shut down for 16 days and about 850,000 federal employees were furloughed. The shutdown was massively unpopular among voters \u2013 with 8 in 10 Americans disapproving, including a majority of Republicans \u2013 and dinged Americans\u2019 confidence with the GOP. Mr. McAuliffe tied his Republican opponent to the shutdown and won the race just a few weeks later. But Mr. Hurtt says he doesn\u2019t see the frustration on the ground against DOGE cuts like he did against the government in 2013. Instead, he says Republicans \u201care even more fired up\u201d than they were last year, when his county party raised more money than any other year since they started keeping record over a decade ago. Earlier this week, Mr. Hurtt asked his email list of roughly 12,000 recipients across Northern Virginia if they, or anyone they knew, were affected by the cuts. \u201cI got two emails back in response,\u201d says Mr. Hurtt. Mr. Hurtt acknowledges, however, that his cohorts at the Arlington Democrats likely have more members who are federal employees. And he is probably correct. A 2021 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Democrats make the plurality of all career civil servants, with a Democratic overrepresentation \u201cin nearly every department.\u201d Between 1997 and 2019, around 50% of federal employees were identified as Democratic, while the share of Republican federal employees decreased from 32% to 26%. This divide could help explain the dramatically different responses from local parties on the ground. Whereas the Fairfax County Democrats have been collecting stories from fired or fearful Virginias through their website, where a form on the homepage instructs locals to share personal stories about how they have been affected by \u201cMusk\u2019s mass firings,\u201d their Republican counterparts are of the mind that the personnel cuts in Virginia could actually help Republicans. \u201cThe cuts are certainly being felt in northern Virginia ... but I think many more people are having their eyes opened by the waste, fraud, and abuse that Elon Musk has uncovered,\u201d says Katie Gorka, chair of the Fairfax County GOP. \u201cSo if anything, it\u2019s going to help us.\u201d And all Republicans caution patience. November, in the political world, is years from now. Republican Delegate Rob Bloxom, who represents part of Virginia\u2019s eastern shore, says the current number of federal employees who have applied for unemployment in the state is somewhere between 70 and 300, according to a report he received from the Virginia Employment Commission. \u201cEverybody is just guessing\u201d the true percentage of Virginia workers who will be affected, he says. \u201cIs 10% the number? Is 50% the number? We don\u2019t know. All of this is conjecture,\u201d says Mr. Bloxom. \u201cI think it\u2019s prudent to be aware of [the cuts], but I think it\u2019s premature to sound the alarm bells and say the sky is falling.\u201d Mr. Bloxom is the vice chair on an emergency committee created by Democratic House Speaker Don Scott to \u201cstudy and understand the potential impacts of cuts to the federal civilian workforce\u201d and assess any impacts to the state budget passed by the General Assembly last week. Virginia, which relies heavily on income taxes for its budget, is also constitutionally required to have a balanced budget. The General Assembly could be called back to pass a new budget if its projected revenue streams drop too far. Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights. Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads.

Feb. 26, 2025, 5:30 a.m. ET\n\t\n\n|\nNew York In recent days, New York City\u2019s Mayor Eric Adams has escaped a possible ouster by the governor over corruption allegations. But a larger reality may be emerging in the Big Apple: The city is fast preparing to move on without him. A primary election is on the horizon, and Mr. Adams\u2019 low popularity among voters and Democratic kingmakers makes him a long shot for the job, if he even runs. The hurdles are sizeable. In addition to the federal bribery and corruption charges, which he denies and which the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office has moved to dismiss amid pressure from President Donald Trump, Mayor Adams also faces a Democratic governor and high-ranking officials who want him gone, the resignation of half of his deputy mayors, and tanking approval. In New York City, an active mayoral primary race is getting underway. And polls suggest it\u2019s a wide-open race, even though current Mayor Eric Adams hasn\u2019t been ousted or tried on pending corruption charges. Gov. Kathy Hochul announced last week that she would not use her authority to remove Mayor Adams from office but would seek to impose new guardrails on his administration. But what may prove most damaging in this true-blue city is the consensus that Mayor Adams has cozied up to the locally reviled Republican president in exchange for freedom from prosecution. A former Republican, Mayor Adams says he won\u2019t resign or run on the GOP ticket despite his latest tack toward President Trump on immigration. The mayor doubled down on blocking services for undocumented migrants in New York after Mr. Trump\u2019s new Justice Department moved to dismiss the charges against him. As for mayoral contenders, the leaderboard is murky. Out front in an early poll is Andrew Cuomo. The pugnacious, three-term former governor won early nationwide acclaim for his COVID-19 response, but he resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations. Looking to make a comeback, Mr. Cuomo is racking up endorsements, although he hasn\u2019t officially announced that he is running. He leads the embattled mayor 33% to 10% in polling of Democratic voters. \u201cMore than ever, NYC needs effective, fearless leadership to defend our city and these critical values,\u2019\u2019 wrote Democratic fundraiser Charles Myers in a note to potential Cuomo supporters last week, according to Politico. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s last turn in public office ended in disgrace. In addition to sexual harassment allegations, he also faced scrutiny over his decision to move recovering COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, his alleged improper reporting of death toll numbers, and his use of government resources to help write a book. While one accuser dropped her sexual harassment suit against him, two other suits continue. He could announce as early as this weekend, according to the New York Times. Still, Democratic insiders say uneasiness about Mayor Adams and the sharp-elbowed Mr. Cuomo is behind efforts to draft another mayoral candidate: City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (no relation to the mayor). She has called on Mayor Adams to resign but has remained silent on her potential candidacy. \u201cFour months out from the primary, people who are otherwise very knowledgeable about New York City government and politics have no idea what the final field will look like, let alone who will win,\u201d says Jon Paul Lupo, an unaffiliated Democratic consultant. Joining the fray are several other current and former city officials, state lawmakers, and an outsider. Few are well known. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s high name recognition gives him an early advantage. \u201cBut the race is fluid,\u2019\u2019 he says. Tracking behind Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Adams is former city comptroller and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, whose 2021 mayoral bid was derailed by harassment allegations that he denies. Once known as a progressive, Mr. Stringer is shifting toward the center, emphasizing crime, cost of living, and education. Eight percent of Emerson College poll respondents said he would be their top choice. It\u2019s a three-way tie for fourth place. State Senator Jessica Ramos from Queens is campaigning for affordable housing, improved public transit, universal daycare, and worker rights. Brooklyn State Senator Zellnor Myrie wants affordable housing and free universal after-school programs. City Comptroller Brad Lander\u2019s signature issues are the mental health crisis and street homelessness. Each has 6% support. The rest \u2013 Whitney Tilson, a former portfolio manager now campaigning against corruption; Michael Blake, a former Bronx assembly member and aide to President Obama who wants improved safety and reduced pollution; and Zohran Mamdani, a pro-Palestinian state assembly member who calls for lowering the cost of living \u2013 are polling in the low single digits. Whoever wins the primary in this heavily Democratic city is likely to become mayor. A January poll by the conservative Manhattan Institute found that 66% of respondents believe the city is heading in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, various polls show voters citing crime and affordable housing as their top concerns, followed by the economy and immigration. Despite Mayor Adams\u2019s political and legal troubles \u2013 he\u2019s been charged with long-running conspiracy, wire fraud, soliciting illegal foreign campaign contributions from foreign nationals, and bribery \u2013 he could still seek reelection. It would be a battle. He\u2019s more unpopular than President Trump among local voters. Fifty-eight percent view Mr. Adams unfavorably, compared with 53% for Mr. Trump and 37% for Mr. Cuomo, according to the Emerson poll. Lifelong Manhattan resident and independent voter Irina Langer echoes many residents in saying just about anyone would be better than Mr. Adams. She faults him for high costs, unclean streets, and other quality-of-life issues like broken subway escalators. While Mr. Cuomo has a commanding lead, the four months until the June 24th ranked-choice primary are eons in a race like this. Businessman Andrew Yang led at this same point in the last mayoral election cycle \u2013 only to finish fourth. \u201cNo campaign has been fully engaged yet. No one is advertising on TV; no one is spending real money on digital, people\u2019s mailboxes or debates,\u201d says Alex Navarro-McKay, a Democratic consultant supporting Mr. Lander. Last week, Mr. Cuomo reposted an endorsement from former New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall on the social platform X, who urged his former opponent to run. \u201cMore than anyone else, Andrew is the leader we need and the leader we deserve,\u2019\u2019 Mr. McCall wrote. \u201cOur situation today is truly unique, and the risks of ignoring it will elevate chaos over the common good.\u201d Mr. Cuomo called Mr. McCall\u2019s sentiments \u201chumbling and deeply meaningful.\u201d Candidates have until April to file with the city Board of Elections, though most move sooner to raise money and collect signatures needed to appear on the ballot. Mr. Cuomo, whose late father Mario was also a three-term New York governor, has spent decades in politics. He served as President Clinton\u2019s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001, New York\u2019s attorney general from 2007 to 2010, and governor from 2011 until resigning almost four years ago amid sexual harassment claims that he denies. \u201cHe wants to make a comeback, and he\u2019s only got one shot,\u201d says a Democratic consultant who asked not to be named. \u201cThe decision is less \u2018Do I run?\u2019 than \u2018Do I run for mayor [this year] or governor next year?\u2019\u201d The mayor\u2019s job in New York City is a high-profile position that often garners national attention. Not surprisingly, at least four of the city\u2019s mayors \u2013 John Lindsay, Michael Bloomberg, Bill de Blasio, and Rudy Giuliani \u2013 have tried to make the transition from Gracie Mansion to the White House. None was successful. Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights. Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads. Higher office has proven an elusive quest for former Empire State governors as well.

Feb. 26, 2025, 5:30 a.m. ET\n\t\n\n|\nWashington Elon Musk\u2019s waste-slashing initiative has pushed the operations of the federal government into the spotlight in a way that hasn\u2019t been seen in modern history. The entity called the Department of Government Efficiency has moved rapidly from an idea Mr. Musk pitched to Donald Trump while he was campaigning last summer to an aggressive reality of the second Trump term. The president has empowered DOGE to access government databases, initiate layoffs, and halt diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The effort faces some speed bumps as it barrels forward: Several federal agencies directed their staff not to reply to an email requesting a list of weekly accomplishments by Monday night, even after Mr. Musk said on social media that failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. On Tuesday, some DOGE employees quit in protest of the unit\u2019s actions. Courts have also blocked DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive records at the Education and Treasury departments. The combative tactics of the new Department of Government Efficiency raise questions about where the effort derives its power and how it fits into the U.S. governing apparatus. And, while not denying the guiding hand of Mr. Musk, the White House Tuesday announced who is serving as acting administrator of DOGE: Amy Gleason, whose background includes work for the U.S. Digital Service during the first Trump administration. These actions have stirred up debate around topics that don\u2019t usually make everyday conversation: What are hiring rules for the civil service? Where does agency authority come from? Arcane government laws are suddenly front and center as Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk attempt a dramatic reshaping of the federal government. \u201cThese are some of the wonkiest questions that really experts in government and policy would only know,\u201d says Roger Nober, director of the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University. But \u201cNow these are everyday, banner-headline matters.\u201d Even DOGE\u2019s name creates confusion \u2013 the Department of Government Efficiency is not really a \u201cdepartment\u201d at all. (The name allows for an acronym that sounds like a cryptocurrency that Mr. Musk has been a fan of.) But what exactly is it? Here\u2019s a look at how federal agencies and departments work, and how DOGE fits in. The United States has more than 400 federal agencies. Fifteen of those are Cabinet departments, like the Department of State. The rest are a scattering of organizations that administer various government activities. Some of these agencies are nested within Cabinet departments. For example, the FBI functions under the Department of Justice. Others are independent, meaning they\u2019re still part of the executive branch, but are intended by Congress to be freer from presidential control. Typically, Congress creates government agencies. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\u201d for carrying out the powers that it\u2019s granted by the Constitution. Since the days of the Founding Fathers, courts have interpreted that phrase to mean that it\u2019s Congress\u2019 role to pass laws that put federal agencies into place. However, it\u2019s the president\u2019s job to make sure laws are \u201cfaithfully executed.\u201d Presidents get to select the heads of agencies, with the caveat that top leadership positions must be approved by the Senate \u2013 a compromise that dates back to the Constitutional Convention. The president can also make changes in the day-to-day operations of an agency, such as creating new offices or eliminating specific divisions. \u201cThe president has great latitude to create his own staff and the structure of his advisers,\u201d says Mr. Nober. Many people expected that Mr. Trump would create DOGE as an outside advisory body. Instead, he signed an executive order to rename an existing organization, the U.S. Digital Service, as the U.S. DOGE Service. The U.S. Digital Service was established within the Executive Office of the President in 2014 after the Obama administration\u2019s failed HealthCare.gov launch. Its goal was to create better user experiences through modern technology. According to the wording of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order, the mission of the newly renamed service is, \u201cmodernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\u201d Within the new U.S. DOGE Service, Mr. Trump established the DOGE Service Temporary Organization \u2013 which is the effort that Mr. Musk has touted. Its role is to \u201cbe dedicated to advancing the President\u2019s 18-month DOGE agenda.\u201d The temporary organization will expire July 4, 2026, the date Mr. Musk had previously advertised, but the overall U.S. DOGE Service will stay in place. On Tuesday, 21 employees who worked for the original Digital Service office resigned, according to The Associated Press. \u201cWe will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE\u2019s actions,\u201d the employees wrote in a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Additionally, Mr. Trump\u2019s order called for \u201cDOGE teams\u201d to operate within every government agency. The teams must consist of at least four employees and include a team lead, engineer, human resources specialist, and attorney. The teams are appointed by agency heads and the U.S. DOGE Service administrator, and will ostensibly work with the agencies to manage waste. An executive order Feb. 11 gave DOGE teams additional authority to create hiring plans. DOGE has been acting with an unprecedented degree of authority. It has accessed sensitive government data and been given veto power over hiring decisions. Many of DOGE\u2019s operations have been shrouded in mystery, including the people who have lead roles.\u00a0Mr. Musk's influence is evident, yet many had assumed until recently that he was officially in charge, since Mr. Trump has previously said Mr. Musk would \u201clead\u201d the department. But in a recent court document, a top White House official revealed that Mr. Musk is not DOGE\u2019s administrator. In fact, he\u2019s not even a DOGE employee. Instead, Mr. Musk is a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d \u2013 essentially a part-time federal employee \u2013 and an adviser to the president. Now Ms. Gleason has been publicly named \u2013 more than a month since DOGE was launched \u2013 as acting administrator. Mr. Musk has taken credit for most of DOGE\u2019s actions. \u201cWe spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,\u201d he said in a social media post. Most government agencies are also subject to certain transparency requirements. But it\u2019s unclear if those will apply to this initiative. For example, the Freedom of Information Act gives the public the right to request records from federal agencies. But DOGE could have a loophole. There\u2019s a rule saying that agencies within the Executive Office of the President are exempt from FOIA if their \u201csole function is to advise and assist the President.\u201d The White House might try to argue that DOGE falls into this category, further shielding it from scrutiny. DOGE is already facing at least 20 lawsuits, according to a New York Times tracker. Many allege privacy violations, given DOGE employees\u2019 access to federal databases. Others highlight constitutional concerns like the separation of powers between the branches of government. Among the U.S. public, reaction to DOGE is mixed. A recent poll found that 60% of voters think it is helping to make major cuts in government spending. A similar figure, 58% of voters, also say DOGE employees should not have access to sensitive records like Americans\u2019 names, Social Security numbers, and addresses. Earlier this month, 14 states filed a lawsuit against DOGE calling Mr. Musk\u2019s actions unconstitutional. They say the fact that Mr. Musk seems to be wielding great individual authority, despite not having been confirmed by Congress, violates a part of the Constitution called the appointments clause. \u201cPresident Trump has delegated virtually unchecked authority to Mr. Musk without proper legal authorization from Congress and without meaningful supervision of his activities,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cThe sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation\u2019s entire constitutional structure.\u201d A district judge in Washington temporarily paused the lawsuit last week, saying the states didn\u2019t prove that immediate, irreparable harm would come from DOGE\u2019s efforts. The judge expressed hesitation about Mr. Musk\u2019s role, however. So, is DOGE\u2019s activity inherently unconstitutional? The answer may depend on where its authority is vested. The White House has not made it clear which individual has final decision-making authority at DOGE. Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights. Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads. Thomas Berry, a constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute, says there might not necessarily be a constitutional problem if the department heads are making the ultimate calls. That\u2019s because department heads are already confirmed by Congress. But if it\u2019s Mr. Musk who gets to decide whether to fire officers or to cut spending at agencies, that would be a problem. \u201cBypassing that entirely \u2013 having someone with significant authority who hasn\u2019t been Senate-confirmed ... means you\u2019ve lost that security check that the framers thought was crucial to the system,\u201d he says.

At heart, that is what Donald Trump is arguing: He was elected president (again) last November, and therefore the American people have given him carte blanche to act as he sees fit. But the reality may be more than the United States bargained for. President Trump has been moving with lightning speed to carry out his agenda \u2013 signing a blizzard of executive orders and empowering Elon Musk\u2019s task force, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to remake the federal bureaucracy, as it dismantles agencies and pushes out civil servants. America\u2019s founders, wanting to prevent political factions, gave equal power to Congress, the courts, and the executive branch. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions are stressing that delicate balance. In the process, President Trump is essentially doing an end run around Congress, which holds the \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d But rather than trying to stop him, Republican lawmakers \u2013 who control both houses of Congress \u2013 are mostly urging him to keep going. Mr. Trump is also rhetorically challenging the authority of the judicial branch. He has attacked judges as \u201cliberal activists\u201d and suggested that anything he does to \u201csave\u201d the country cannot be illegal \u2013 though he has also stated that he would abide by court rulings. To Democrats and many scholars, the situation has all the markings of a constitutional crisis: The president is upending the United States\u2019 centuries-old balance of power as laid out by the Founding Fathers. Instead of three co-equal branches acting as a check on each other, power has become increasingly concentrated over the years in the White House \u2013 a trend that is now being supercharged under Mr. Trump in ways that, to critics, raise the specter of authoritarianism. \u201cThe executive branch is expanding its powers beyond what any other administration has tried to do,\u201d says Shana Kushner Gadarian, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University. \u201cThat\u2019s the crisis we\u2019re in.\u201d To justify their actions, Mr. Trump and his supporters argue it\u2019s the status quo that has broken to the point of being undemocratic. The federal bureaucracy had grown so large and Congress so gridlocked, they say, that it had become impossible for the government to do what the voters want. \u201cIt does not match the will of the people,\u201d Mr. Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, said during a recent informal press conference with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last week. Voters, though, gave Mr. Trump a relatively narrow victory, with slightly less than half of the more than 155 million votes cast. The bureaucracy, the tech executive said, had become an \u201cunelected, fourth, unconstitutional branch of government \u2013 which has, in a lot of ways, currently, more power than any elected representative.\u201d In just one month, Mr. Trump \u2013 aided by Mr. Musk and his DOGE team \u2013 has dramatically cut foreign aid by almost entirely eliminating the U.S. Agency for International Development, begun dismantling the Department of Education, and raised alarm bells over the safety of taxpayer information at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service as DOGE aides look for evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse. Most Republicans in Congress are complying as Mr. Trump usurps the power of the national legislature, as laid out in Article 1 of the Constitution. But some are quietly pushing back, particularly those in battleground districts who at times espouse centrist positions. Take GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who represents such a district in Nebraska. Though he supports the elimination of the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he says it must be done correctly. \u201cWe have got to follow the law,\u201d Representative Bacon told CNN. \u201cIf there are things we have to redirect, let\u2019s do it the constitutional way.\u201d Still, voices like Mr. Bacon\u2019s are few and far between; the vast majority of Republicans in Congress occupy safe GOP seats. If they face a threat, it\u2019s a primary challenge from the right if they are perceived as anti-Trump. And they know that the vast resources available to the Republican Party \u2013 including Mr. Musk\u2019s billions \u2013 could potentially support such a challenger. Compounding the issue is the fact that Republican control of both houses of Congress is exceedingly narrow, with members on both sides unwilling in most cases to break party ranks. This makes Mr. Trump inherently weak in his ability to pass the more controversial elements of his agenda through Congress. So he is focusing on executive actions \u2013 even though several have been challenged in court and could prove to be illegal. Partisan polarization, growing for decades, hinders Congress\u2019 ability to claw back its own power. \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans, including outspoken former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, are now in the political wilderness. And the center has hollowed out, a reflection of the gerrymandering that has made most congressional districts safe for one or the other major party. This scenario demonstrates why the Founding Fathers didn\u2019t mention political parties in the Constitution. They were concerned about factions. But human nature suggests that factions were inevitable, and the founders knew that, says Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. \u201cThey hoped that they had figured out what [James] Madison called \u2018the extent and proper structure\u2019 of our country,\u201d Dr. Perry says. \u201cThe structures were all these checks and balances.\u201d But what they weren\u2019t counting on was lockstep partisanship, which translates today into a pro-Trump, pro-MAGA congressional majority that is likely to reinforce the president\u2019s agenda, at least until the 2026 midterm elections. But even some Republicans are distressed enough by the administration withholding congressionally approved funding that they are asking President Trump to release money meant for farmers and infrastructure projects, among other things. Congress ceding power to the president, and the president aggressively taking it, is not just a Republican phenomenon. It\u2019s been happening for decades. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who took office amid the Great Depression, signed hundreds of executive orders in his first year and, unlike President Trump so far, got Congress to pass major pieces of legislation that massively expanded the federal government. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Republican President George W. Bush created the current-day homeland security structure, and aggressively used \u201csigning statements\u201d when he signed bills into law. Such statements, though not legally binding, provided interpretations of the law that pushed the envelope of executive power. When President Barack Obama\u2019s Democrats lost control of Congress in his first midterm elections, he used what he called a \u201cpen and phone\u201d strategy to enact his agenda: the signing of executive actions and phone calls to outside groups to put pressure on Congress to pass legislation. More recently, President Joe Biden signed more than 40 executive orders in his first 100 days, a record for the post-FDR era. Many of those orders were efforts to undo what his predecessor, Mr. Trump, had done \u2013 creating a pingpong effect as administrations change hands and parties. Mr. Trump has now undone many of Mr. Biden\u2019s orders, signing more than 60 of his own so far. Efforts to reform or rein in the executive branch have waxed and waned over the years. President Ronald Reagan set up the Grace Commission, chaired by businessman J. Peter Grace, to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. While most of its recommendations were never implemented, the commission is credited with conceptualizing future efforts to rein in the federal bureaucracy. Perhaps the most successful government restructuring was launched in 1993 by Vice President Al Gore. In its five years, the National Partnership for Reinventing Government eliminated more than 100 programs and 250,000 federal jobs, and consolidated more than 800 agencies. But unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s effort, the Gore initiative involved careful review of programs and expenditures before action was taken. By all appearances, President Biden lacked interest in government reform. During his first two years in office, he launched only two reform initiatives, compared with 37 during President Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms and 31 during the Reagan presidency. As a result, President Biden may have helped pave the way for the current Trump-Musk effort. Public trust in democracy has been in near-steady decline since the 1980s. A recent uptick in Gallup polling, after the November election and before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, reflects higher satisfaction among Republicans. Mr. Musk has latched on to public unhappiness with government and turned it into a crusade. The DOGE team has been going into the data systems of various government agencies targeted for downsizing or outright elimination, alarming public-interest watchdogs. Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Musk\u2019s efforts, and made him a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d amid concerns that the multibillionaire was operating without any legal guidelines or oversight. One looming question centers on Mr. Musk\u2019s many corporate interests that have business with the federal government, and whether he is benefiting from DOGE\u2019s actions. When asked, he denies any conflict of interest. For American governance writ large, the biggest test is yet to come. Legal challenges to many of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are in court, and a key question is, What happens if the Supreme Court rules against him? Does he comply? Or will Mr. Trump follow the example of an earlier disrupter in chief, President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait hangs in the Oval Office? In 1832, President Jackson famously ignored a Supreme Court ruling on Native American rights, and challenged the high court to enforce its decision. It could not.

Feb. 24, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET\n\t\n\n|\nWashington President Donald Trump and his new efficiency head, Elon Musk, are taking aim at government fraud as part of their campaign to reshape and streamline the federal bureaucracy. So far, the duo has hinted at widespread fraud without posting true evidence. For example, they have said that Social Security payments may be going out in the names of tens of millions of dead centenarians. Lee Dudek, the administration\u2019s new head of the Social Security Administration, said that is not the case. Still, they are onto something. Eliminating fraud \u2013 if possible \u2013 could reduce federal spending by as much as 8%. But addressing the problem is costly and requires greater precision than President Donald Trump\u2019s unconventional anti-fraud effort so far. Every year, the federal government could be losing between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). At the high end, that is about 8% of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in its last fiscal year. A rush of pandemic spending contributed to the problem. At a congressional hearing this month, Haywood Talcove, a CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, estimated that COVID-19 relief programs were defrauded of more than $1 trillion, much of it going to overseas criminals. If it focuses effectively on combating fraud, the Trump administration has the chance to create common ground in its controversial streamlining efforts. \u201cAs citizens, as taxpayers, we want to ensure that our dollars are well spent,\u201d says Joseph Mauriello, director of the Center for Internal Auditing Excellence at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cWe may not agree, politically speaking, with how those dollars are spent,\u201d but Americans should be able to rally around keeping them out of the hands of fraudsters. The surge in fraud is one factor that has given President Trump and Mr. Musk the political momentum to focus attention on the federal bureaucracy, reviewing budgets of different government agencies and departments. One month into the process, they have also used it to highlight waste and abuse, a separate problem and one that is often in the eye of the beholder. It\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019ll initiate the hard work of rooting out actual fraud. If they don\u2019t tackle fraud, it represents a lost opportunity to crack down on criminal activity that siphons off billions of dollars a year in federal payments. It could also lead to a worse situation than exists today, auditing professionals say. \u201cThis could be a thoughtful way to begin a serious conversation\u201d about what services the government should provide, suggests Shivaram Rajgopal, professor of accounting and auditing at Columbia Business School, in a written response to questions. \u201cHowever, \u2018Move fast and break things\u2019 may not be a wise strategy for a lumbering old giant that is accountable to 300 million people.\u201d Some auditing professionals peg overall fraud, as a share of federal spending, closer to the private sector\u2019s typical 3% to 5%. The total has surged in recent years in part because of pandemic-era emergency spending that included fraudulently obtained loans, credits, and payments meant for American workers, families, and small businesses under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Estimating the scale of the problem matters because detecting and prosecuting fraud does not come cheap. If the federal government spends $10 million to prosecute fraud worth $1 million, that might not be worth the effort. This can involve judgment calls. According to Mr. Dudek, the Social Security Administration decided not to upgrade the antiquated system that apparently confused Mr. Musk because it would cost upwards of $9 million. That is why auditing professionals say anti-fraud teams should follow the money. Targeting big federal agencies and those with a history of poor recordkeeping is likely to yield the biggest payoffs, such as with the Defense Department and Medicare. President Trump\u2019s streamlining effort, called the Department of Government Efficiency, has instead spread its fire. DOGE has targeted Social Security and reportedly looked into data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (which issues Medicare checks) and the National Institutes of Health, both part of the Department of Health and Human Services. It has also gotten read-only access to Treasury Department records, which show where other federal payments have gone. Outside of that, it has targeted much smaller departments, such as the Education Department (4% of the budget), and a host of even smaller agencies that spend about 1% or less of the budget. Then there\u2019s the time factor. If the GAO were to initiate an agency audit, it would use a standardized process that involves gathering the right group of people, meeting with interested parties to iron out goals and get feedback, collecting and examining evidence, reviewing comments on drafts and findings, and writing a comprehensive report. In all, the process might take nine months. \u201cIt\u2019s a really rigorous process,\u201d says Rebecca Shea, a director in GAO\u2019s Forensic Audits and Investigative Service. \u201cEvery word in the report, every line, every number, is indexed and referenced. It is tied back, linked back, to a piece of evidence that we have collected.\u201d DOGE, by contrast, has started down a much different path. Instead of deliberation, it has moved with entrepreneurial speed. Instead of the fact-checking rigor of a GAO audit, Mr. Musk has made unsubstantiated claims, some of which have turned out to be false. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to bat a thousand,\u201d he told reporters in a recent press briefing. He promised to quickly fix any problems. Mr. Musk\u2019s own status within DOGE is nebulous. Although a White House court filing describes him as a senior adviser to the president with no authority over DOGE, President Trump said last Wednesday he had put Mr. Musk in charge of the project. One feature of the government\u2019s initial response to the pandemic was that Congress emphasized payout speed over accountability. That allowed criminal gangs, often overseas, to steal Americans\u2019 identities and apply for benefits under their names. Since then, the federal government has made some progress in addressing these losses. In fiscal year 2022, four other agencies joined the 10 already compliant with federal standards for reducing improper payments, which include fraudulent ones. On the fraud front, the Biden administration created the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force in 2021. As of April 2024, it had recovered $1.4 billion in fraudulent claims and charged more than 3,500 defendants, leading to 250 indictments, including for members of gangs and overseas crime rings. But that\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared with the estimated hundreds of billions of federal dollars that were stolen in recent years. And it illustrates what many reformers have long urged. It\u2019s far securer and cheaper for agencies to better verify recipients of payments before they actually send the funds. Technology could help. \u201cThe tools that are used in the private sector aren\u2019t used in the public sector,\u201d Mr. Talcove of LexisNexis told the congressional subcommittee. If the government would implement such processes as front-end identity verification, \u201cYou will see the fraud rate go down dramatically.\u201d Artificial intelligence and other technologies might also allow agencies to detect more fraud, with fewer staff hours required. But \u201cWhen you find evidence of fraud, you still have to build a case,\u201d says Robert Bixby, executive director of The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that encourages fiscal responsibility in Washington. \u201cYou have to develop the evidence and present it in court and get a conviction. You still need people to do that.\u201d Amid the move to fight fraud, waste, and abuse, the Trump administration fired more than a dozen inspectors general at federal agencies. IGs are the watchdogs within agencies who make sure taxpayer money is well spent. Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights. Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads.

Feb. 21, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held his first official meeting in Washington last week, he brought his foreign minister and security adviser. The U.S. official he was meeting with, Elon Musk, brought three of his children and the mother of two of them. At the end, the two men exchanged gifts; Mr. Modi distributed books to the children. The family-style sit-down with Mr. Musk, the owner of SpaceX and chief executive of Tesla, preceded Mr. Modi\u2019s bilateral meetings with President Donald Trump and senior Cabinet members. Asked by reporters whether Mr. Musk had been acting in a private or official capacity, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t know. \u201cThey met, and I assume he wants to do business in India.\u201d Blurred lines and proximity to power have become hallmarks of Mr. Musk\u2019s virtual takeover of Washington. Over the past month, the tech billionaire who leveraged his wealth and fame to help reelect Mr. Trump has become perhaps the most prominent, prolific, and feared figure in his administration. His self-styled Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) within the White House has taken an axe to a swath of federal agencies and to the government\u2019s professional workforce. President Trump credits Elon Musk with leading efforts to disrupt, shrink, and overhaul the federal bureacuracy. Mr. Musk has major business interests intertwined with the very government he is remaking. Mr. Musk\u2019s precise role is amorphous. On paper, he\u2019s an unpaid adviser to Mr. Trump and has no legal authority over DOGE, which was originally billed as an outside commission providing recommendations. In reality, he\u2019s emerged as the president\u2019s indefatigable attack dog, propagandist, and auditing specialist. Analysts say there\u2019s no precedent for such an unelected individual to sit at the nexus of power and politics with a mandate to orchestrate a sweeping makeover of how government works. Some Democrats have chided Mr. Musk for acting as \u201cco-president,\u201d a calculated jibe at the elected president he serves. In an unusual joint appearance on Fox News that aired Tuesday, the two men rebutted this criticism. Mr. Musk began by telling host Sean Hannity that he loved the president and that he is \u201ca good man.\u201d Mr. Trump thanked him and called him a \u201cbrilliant guy.\u201d Both laughed at jokes made by the other; Mr. Hannity likened them to brothers. When the host brought up criticism of \u201cPresident Musk\u201d\u00a0imagery used by Time magazine, Mr. Trump jumped in. \u201cElon called me. He said, \u2018You know they\u2019re trying to drive us apart.\u2019 I said \u2018absolutely.\u2019\u201d Mr. Musk insists that his role is simply to ensure the elected president\u2019s orders are fully implemented by the federal bureaucracy. \u201cSo what we\u2019re doing here, one of the biggest functions of the DOGE team, is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out,\u201d he told Mr. Hannity. Mr. Musk has taken to his mission with gusto, sleeping at work and hiring young workers with a Silicon Valley startup mindset to disrupt the slow-moving, deliberative process in public institutions. On the disruption front, supporters and critics alike agree, he\u2019s succeeding. \u201cThe extra sauce that he brings is the optics of doing things very, very quickly, and shockingly. He\u2019s clearly uninterested \u2026 about the legal consequences of doing things\u201d that may violate norms or even the Constitution, says Thomas Pepinsky, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies political economies. Mr. Musk also eschews any fear of failure or political blowback that would typically constrain politicians in his position, says Gary Gerstle, an emeritus professor of American History at the University of Cambridge. This clashes with a culture of public administration that discourages risk-taking. Mr. Musk himself has said he and his team are likely to \u201cmake mistakes\u201d but that when they do, they will try to correct them. \u201cHe adds a manic energy and a single-mindedness that has been characteristic of all his endeavors, and also his deep belief that you\u2019ve got to break things in order to fix them. That\u2019s his business model \u2026 never being afraid to blow up rockets in search for the right rocket,\u201d Professor Gerstle says. Much of DOGE\u2019s agenda maps onto Project 2025, a plan of action drawn up by conservative groups allied with Mr. Trump to shrink the federal bureaucracy and greatly enhance presidential authority. During the campaign, Mr. Trump publicly distanced himself from the document. Acting alone and with other White House staff, DOGE has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and forced the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, and other major agencies to allow access to closely guarded databases, while pushing for personnel restructuring and layoffs. It claims to have already uncovered $55 billion in fraud, waste, and abuse, though documents posted by DOGE suggest this amount may be greatly exaggerated. Mr. Musk has said that layoffs and artificial-intelligence-based fraud audits will help close the federal deficit, currently $1.8 trillion a year. Many of Mr. Musk\u2019s misleading or outright incorrect claims have become talking points for Mr. Trump. Last week, Mr. Musk claimed that his team had uncovered millions of Social Security recipients more than 100 years old, including some as old as 150, which \u201cmight be the biggest fraud in history.\u201d Experts quickly countered that this appeared to be a misreading of a database that didn\u2019t have certified death information for people born before 1920, something auditors already knew about, and not evidence of claims being processed for deceased recipients. But Mr. Trump has continued to repeat these claims, telling a Saudi-backed investment summit in Miami on Wednesday night about millions of purported Americans over the age of 100 receiving government checks. DOGE has drawn considerable criticism for its haphazard dismissals of federal employees to meet reduction targets without apparent consideration of impacts. Nuclear inspectors were laid off, then called back to work. This week the Department of Agriculture had to backtrack on DOGE-instigated layoffs of employees working on the federal response to bird flu. Mr. Musk\u2019s lightning strikes have also triggered numerous lawsuits. One, filed by 14 Democratic state attorneys general, argues that he lacks the constitutional authority to resize the government since he isn\u2019t a Senate-confirmed officeholder. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington, Tanya Chutkan, rejected their immediate request to block DOGE from firing workers at federal agencies, saying they couldn\u2019t prove irreparable harm. But Judge Chutkan wrote that the plaintiffs were right to question \u201cwhat appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight.\u201d In a filing to the court, a White House official stated that, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t run DOGE and doesn\u2019t even work there but was simply a \u201csenior advisor\u201d to the president. \u201cLike other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President\u2019s directives,\u201d the White House wrote. Analysts say the legal ambiguity around Mr. Musk, whom Mr. Trump repeatedly praises for his leadership of DOGE, adds to the confusion over its secretive work inside agencies. Pushback by Congress has been noticeably lacking, because Republican lawmakers both mostly support DOGE\u2019s cost-cutting goals and are reluctant to cross Mr. Trump and risk a primary-election challenge. The passivity of Congress is striking when DOGE is dismantling agencies whose budgets have been appropriated by lawmakers, says Andrew Rudalevige, a professor of government at Bowdoin College who studies executive orders. \u201cIf they wanted to cut spending on foreign aid, if they wanted to reorganize the executive branch, if they wanted to slash government employment, those are things you do in law,\u201d he says. This controversy has shone a spotlight on Mr. Musk and DOGE, whose team was given expanded powers by Mr. Trump last week to oversee hiring and firing at key agencies. Legal scholars say DOGE\u2019s access to government databases that had been walled off to political appointees appears to violate the 1974 Privacy Act passed after Watergate. Most of the lawsuits filed against DOGE have cited the act\u2019s protections. As a federal contractor and businessman whose companies are regulated by government agencies, Mr. Musk has multiple conflicts of interest when it comes to DOGE\u2019s cost-cutting agenda, as well as the White House\u2019s domestic and foreign policies. For example, his company SpaceX is a major contractor to the Defense Department and NASA, whose budgets and personnel Mr. Musk is slashing. SpaceX is also under multiple investigations for its labor practices. Mr. Trump has waved away these concerns. Last week he told reporters in the Oval Office, in front of Mr. Musk, that \u201cwe would not let him do that segment or look in that area if we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest.\u201d Sources: The New York Times, Reuters, The Associated Press, and federal agencies It\u2019s a criminal offense for federal employees to participate in any government decisions that could have a direct impact on their personal finances, such as a business deal or contract, says Richard Painter, the former chief ethics officer for President George W. Bush. Advisers to the president must also file a disclosure statement about their holdings. The White House says Mr. Musk is a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a temporary position that applies to those who work for 130 days or less during a year. This designation means that Mr. Musk\u2019s disclosure statement isn\u2019t required to be made public until eight years after the president leaves office, unlike full-time government officials. Special government employees typically serve on advisory commissions and bring specialist knowledge, says Professor Painter, who now teaches law at the University of Minnesota. \u201cI never saw someone like Musk do what Musk does,\u201d he says, calling the situation \u201cinappropriate.\u201d In its filing, the White House compared Mr. Musk to Anita Dunn, a political consultant hired by President Joe Biden as a special employee. Ms. Dunn eventually joined the White House as a full-time strategist and was required to disclose her assets and recuse herself from related decisions. Another point of comparison, says Professor Rudalevige, is Jack Smith, the special prosecutor appointed by the Department of Justice to handle Mr. Trump\u2019s criminal cases. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers persuaded one judge that Mr. Smith\u2019s actions were illegitimate because he hadn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate. \u201cAnd yet here we have Mr. Musk, who is apparently just a temporary White House employee, bragging about feeding agencies into wood-chippers,\u201d he says. Like the president he serves, Mr. Musk is often dismissive of courts that rule against him. \u201cA corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!\u201d he wrote on X, the social media platform he owns, after a court temporarily blocked DOGE\u2019s access to Treasury databases. On Saturday, Mr. Trump posted on his own social-media platform that \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d He later pinned the tweet at the top of his page.

Given the uncertainty over how courts interpret the Constitution, coupled with the possibility that the president defies their rulings, Democrats and others who oppose what DOGE is doing shouldn\u2019t put too much stock in the courts stopping Mr. Musk, says Daniel Farbman, professor of constitutional law at Boston College. Instead, they need to bring the public along by exposing the risks posed by Mr. Musk\u2019s unfettered power. Judges are also aware of the risk of ruling actions unconstitutional after they have already happened, such as DOGE\u2019s examination of tax databases, without obvious means of redress. \u201cI don\u2019t think Elon Musk feels constrained by anything,\u201d Professor Farbman says. \u201cThe question is whether you can build a politics that makes it necessary\u201d for Mr. Musk and the administration to obey the courts.

Donald Trump\u2019s blizzard of immigration policy changes has spanned the borders, the interior, and deportation plans. They\u2019ve largely prioritized security over humanitarian concerns. His government paints unauthorized immigrants as national threats requiring a military response. This early on, the impact on public safety and the economy remains to be seen. Yet the number of illegal southern border crossings have continued a downward trend. In the interior, fear and confusion in immigrant communities have taken root, keeping adults home from work and children home from school. President Donald Trump\u2019s first month featured significant change in U.S. immigration policy. The future of the transformation now rests partly with courts. Mr. Trump is also broadening the scope of whom he could remove. Beyond talk of targeting \u201cthe worst\u201d criminals, he\u2019s stripping legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants previously shielded from deportation. In a national ad campaign, the Department of Homeland Security is telling unauthorized immigrants to leave \u2013 or, \u201cWe will find you, and we will deport you,\u201d said Kristi Noem, the department\u2019s new secretary. The president has proved that \u201cThe crisis that we experienced over the past four years was completely unnecessary, that the border is controllable, that our laws are enforceable,\u201d says Ira Mehlman, media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \u201cHe seems to have kept an awful lot of his promises.\u201d Mr. Trump signed 11 executive actions concerning immigration on his first day. And over his first month, more than 100 immigration policy developments have emerged, reports the Immigration Policy Tracking Project. Those actions and policies carry risk, says Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford law professor and Yale research scholar who created the tracking project. The administration is trying to \u201csqueeze every last ounce of justice and humanity out of the immigration system,\u201d he says, and doing so \u201cin ways that the courts have found and will find violates the law of the Constitution.\u201d Some orders were quickly implemented. Others may take time. Lawsuits brought by immigrant advocates may also stall plans, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to withhold birthright citizenship from children of certain immigrants. As heads spin from law and policy changes so far, more are expected. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing both immediate changes, but also the laying of the groundwork for future changes,\u201d says Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. She\u2019s seeing a \u201csimilar playbook return,\u201d compared to the first Trump term, but implemented faster. Here\u2019s a look at key developments to date. \u2022\u00a0National emergency declared at the southern border.\u00a0Claiming the sovereignty of the United States is \u201cunder attack\u201d with the entry of criminals and drugs, President Trump declared this emergency on Day 1. He directed the military to help obtain control of the border and suspended the entry of \u201caliens involved in an invasion.\u201d Mr. Trump took office with the number of Border Patrol encounters \u2013 or stops of those crossing illegally \u2013 lower than when he left in 2021. Illegal entries along the southern border have fallen since hitting a record high in December 2023. Border Patrol encounters stood around 47,300 for the month of December. With the U.S. suspending entry, they plummeted in January to 29,100. That is the lowest since May 2020. Immigrant advocates have sued the government over access to asylum, which U.S. law says immigrants may seek even if they entered illegally. \u2022\u00a0Migrant appointments at ports of entry ended.\u00a0The government stopped the use of an app called CBP One for migrants seeking lawful entry into the U.S. To deter illegal crossings, the Biden administration had encouraged migrants to set up initial appointments at official ports of entry through the app, after which they could be let in and apply for asylum. Republicans had decried the app\u2019s use as a backdoor for otherwise unauthorized immigrants. Since 2023, over 900,000 people had been let in through the process, CBS News reports. \u2022 Limits to citizenship blocked by courts.\u00a0The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted to guarantee U.S. citizenship to virtually all children born here, regardless of their immigration status. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Day 1 seeking to bar birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants and those here temporarily. Four courts have so far blocked the order; the government is appealing two of those decisions. If a case challenging the executive order reaches the Supreme Court, it will have the final say. \u2022\u00a0Laken Riley Act signed into law.\u00a0Signed by the president Jan. 29, the law mandates the federal detention of unauthorized immigrants charged with theft and violent crimes in the U.S. The act\u2019s namesake was a Georgia nursing student who was murdered by a Venezuelan man who authorities say had entered illegally and was cited for theft by shoplifting. \u2022 Temporary protections for immigrants revoked.\u00a0The Trump administration has targeted immigrants who are here without permission. Now, it\u2019s expanding that group by ending temporary deportation relief for others. That revocation includes ending temporary protected status for many Venezuelans, now set to expire in April. The government says extending their temporary stay in the U.S. is \u201ccontrary to the national interest.\u201d He also moved to terminate a separate program, based on a permission to enter called parole, that let in over half a million immigrants. Both temporary statuses have, based on humanitarian grounds, allowed immigrants to live and work in the U.S. \u2022 Refugees barred.\u00a0Refugees, who are fleeing identity-based persecution, are vetted and approved for protection in the U.S. before they arrive. Now Mr. Trump has suspended refugee resettlement indefinitely. (During his first term, he downsized the program, which the Biden White House then rebuilt.) There\u2019s no single definition for \u201csanctuary\u201d cities and states. But the term often implies that officials provide limited cooperation with the federal government on immigration enforcement. The Department of Justice has said it will cut off funding to such cities and states, and has sued Illinois and Chicago over what it calls unconstitutional interference with federal powers. Another lawsuit against New York takes aim at a state law that allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s licenses while limiting federal immigration agencies\u2019 access to driver information. The government has publicized recent operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cities like New York, Chicago, and Denver. ICE is pursuing arrests of unauthorized immigrants in partnership with other federal agencies. Still, \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan has blamed media leaks for hampering plans. ICE initially published daily arrests, but stopped earlier this month. The White House last week announced that ICE arrested 11,000 \u201ccriminals\u201d in an 18-day period. According to a recent estimate, around 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of mid-2023. Against the targeted-criminal narrative, the number of immigrants detained by ICE without criminal histories has been rising since inauguration, reports researcher Austin Kocher. Religious groups and Denver Public Schools, meanwhile, have sued to block ICE enforcement in and around sensitive locations such as churches and schools, which is no longer discouraged by the government. Proponents of the agency say that arrests at such locations are rare, and rather the ability to pursue arrests near such sites makes operations more efficient. \u2022 Promised deportation campaign begins.\u00a0Monthly data on deportations under the Trump administration is not yet available. Yet the government has paved the way for more fast-track deportations. A creation of the Clinton administration, \u201cexpedited removal\u201d takes away immigrants\u2019 access to an immigration judge. \u2022 Military involved in deportation flights and detention.\u00a0Beyond National Guard units stationed at the southern border, the military has also been tapped for costly deportation flights. Those have included military planes to Guatemala, India, and Panama, a country now accepting migrants from places where the U.S. can\u2019t easily send deportees. (Venezuela is also accepting its deported citizens back, reportedly with its own planes.) Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights. Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads. Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay is being used for migrant detention, which the White House says could hold up to 30,000 such beds. Through photos, the government has publicized the faces of immigrants sent to the detention site, claiming that many are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which officials have linked to violent crimes across the U.S. Family members of those sent to \u201cGitmo,\u201d however, have refuted alleged Tren de Aragua ties, reports\u00a0The Washington Post. It\u2019s unclear how ICE is determining such gang membership, though the agency has said indicators include tattoos. Immigrant advocates have sued the Trump administration over detainees\u2019 lack of access to counsel. Already a subscriber?

Tom Homan, the \u201cborder czar\u201d handpicked by President Donald Trump, has arrested, detained, and deported unauthorized immigrants since 1984. Friends call him loyal. Critics have likened him to a Nazi; he counters that the agency he once led deported real ones. Mr. Homan is positioned to play an integral role in shaping the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration. President Trump elevated him to a top White House post and tasked him with being \u201cin charge\u201d of border security and deportation efforts that have already begun. Mr. Homan\u2019s role doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation, and he\u2019ll need to work with others like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. But the president has given him strong backing. \u201cI have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. President Donald Trump has tasked his new \u201cborder czar\u201d with significant responsibilities. The next immigration chapter for the United States may well be shaped by his aggressive plans. The border czar and the president are like-minded on illegal immigration, says Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cIf anything, I think Tom Homan\u2019s understanding of this issue has informed Donald Trump\u2019s \u2013 not the other way around.\u201d In philosophy, though, there appears to be a sliver of difference between the men. The president largely speaks of unauthorized immigrants as endangering the nation. Mr. Homan adds that, by crossing in illegally, they\u2019re also endangering themselves. Mr. Homan\u2019s outlook, shaped over three decades, comes in part from witnessing despair at the border. The country\u2019s next immigration chapter may well be shaped by his hard-line plans. Mr. Homan has a pugilistic air. A fixture of conservative TV, he\u2019ll often raise his voice. He cites immigration law, in favor of more enforcement. Sometimes he\u2019ll curse. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to help us, then just get the hell out of the way,\u201d he says of uncooperative local politicians. And if they impede, \u201cThere will be consequences.\u201d He often speaks of consequences. Not just for \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions and immigrants who don\u2019t abide by laws. But also for the country, with the entry of drugs and criminals that he says the last White House left unchecked. \u201cThe gruff exterior that you see on TV is how he is in person,\u201d says John Fabbricatore, a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement official in Colorado who knows the border czar. \u201cHe demands excellence from the people that work for him. But he\u2019s also very loyal.\u201d Mr. Homan grew up 40 miles south of Canada, in West Carthage, New York, along with six siblings. In high school, he wrestled. He describes his family as \u201cvery conservative and very Catholic,\u201d filling the same pew each Sunday Mass. After a stint in community college, he graduated with honors from SUNY Polytechnic Institute in 1983 with a bachelor of professional studies in criminal justice. Mr. Homan served in his town\u2019s police force after that. His father and grandfather also served in law enforcement. In 1984, he began working for the U.S. Border Patrol, then as a special agent. In Texas, he helped set up an undercover operation that he says ensnared 11 smuggling groups. He\u2019d find migrants stashed in the back of stiflingly hot and crowded tractor-trailer rigs, desperate to head north. In the sweltering Texas heat, it could be 20 or 50 degrees hotter in the back of those trucks, Mr. Homan told a newspaper in 2001. \u201cThe more they use these trucks, the greater the chance for tragedy.\u201d His words foretold a tragedy that would change his life. In May 2003 in Victoria, Texas, a smuggling scheme inside a tractor trailer turned deadly in extreme heat. Nineteen unauthorized immigrants died. Mr. Homan, then working with what is now ICE, assisted the investigation. He noticed a boy inside, around the same age as his youngest son, lying dead in his underwear. It seemed the boy\u2019s father, also dead, had tried to embrace him in their last moments alive. That experience \u201cmade Tom Homan who he is today,\u201d he writes in his book \u201cDefend the Border and Save Lives.\u201d For four nights, he says, he couldn\u2019t sleep. The grim images would fuel what appears to have become his philosophy of deterrence: Remove migrants\u2019 desire to arrive illegally in the first place. Preempt the grief. That perspective doesn\u2019t always consider the civil unrest and other violence driving many asylum-seekers to flee their homes, from places like Haiti and Venezuela. Still, Selene Rodriguez, a campaign director at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, says it\u2019s incorrect to assume that being pro-border security is also anti-humanitarian. \u201cEverybody who comes through Mexico to get to the U.S.-Mexico border has to go through some sort of a cartel network,\u201d she says. That exposes migrants to potential assault, rape, and murder. \u201cNo human being wants anybody to go through something like that.\u201d Mr. Homan says he went to therapy after witnessing the tractor trailer deaths. He continued his job, rising in the ranks. Under the Obama administration, Mr. Homan served as executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations at ICE. Then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson says he called on Mr. Homan as part of a core group of advisers who held varying points of view. He was \u201ca trusted voice,\u201d says Secretary Johnson. While reliably pro-enforcement, Mr. Homan came to meetings \u201carmed with facts, armed with experience and wisdom.\u201d During this era, Central American children and families were arriving en masse. At one point, Mr. Homan presented the idea of separating migrant families at the border, Secretary Johnson recalls. The DHS leader also recalls saying no. Secretary Johnson visualized \u201ctrying to take a small child out of its mother\u2019s arms,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d Still, the administration expanded detention for unauthorized migrant families. President Barack Obama, nicknamed the \u201cdeporter in chief,\u201d gave Mr. Homan the country\u2019s highest award for civil service in 2015. After three decades, Mr. Homan retired from government in January 2017. Then came a phone call at his retirement party. Would he consider coming back for Donald Trump? Mr. Homan put off retirement for a man he calls \u201ctruly a friendly, caring, and honest person,\u201d as he writes in his 2020 book. During the first Trump term, as acting director of ICE, Mr. Homan was an architect of one of its most controversial immigration policies. \u201cKids in cages,\u201d Democrats called it. Mr. Homan has said he suggested the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which resulted in separating children from their parents at the southern border as a deterrent to illegal crossings. The result was thousands of traumatized minors and adults, immigrant advocates say. The American Civil Liberties Union helped arrange reunifications. \u201cOften the child comes back and the first words out of their mouth are, Mommy, Daddy, why didn\u2019t you love me enough to keep me?\u201d says Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney. Family separation was \u201cthe worst thing\u201d that Mr. Gelernt says he has seen in three decades of work. It\u2019s one of several high-profile court challenges that he argued against the first Trump administration. That case ended in a court-ordered settlement agreement in 2023, barring the practice for eight years. The ACLU estimates as many as 1,000 families are still separated from their children. Incoming officials involved in family separation the first time have expressed \u201creally no recognition that the policy was brutal and inhumane,\u201d says Mr. Gelernt. Mr. Homan has said he\u2019s \u201csick and tired\u201d of hearing about family separation. The adviser has said that ICE will look to bring back family detention in \u201csoft-sided\u201d tent setups. It\u2019s unclear whether some form of family separation will evolve under the current administration. \u201cFamilies can be deported together,\u201d he told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October. The White House last week\u00a0announced\u00a0that ICE arrested 11,000 \u201ccriminals\u201d in an 18-day period. According to a\u00a0recent estimate, around 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of mid-2023.\u00a0Along the border with Mexico, Border Patrol encounters \u2014 a proxy for illegal crossings \u2014 dropped to around 29,100 last month. That\u2019s the lowest since May 2020. Mr. Homan\u2019s words \u2013 and the president\u2019s plans \u2013 send a chilling message to many immigrants. \u201cI\u2019m keeping my kids home from school, because I\u2019m scared\u201d of deportation, says a Venezuelan mother, bundled up against the cold at a pro-immigrant rally in Aurora, Colorado, last month. Since the summer, the city has drawn national scrutiny for crimes that officials have linked to suspected members of a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. Mr. Homan\u2019s words for that group? \u201cMy gang\u2019s bigger than your gang.\u201d In Chicago recently, he viewed an early wave of ICE arrests. He says the agency has \u201cgot to do more.\u201d Part of that, in his view, involves communicating results with the American public. Mr. Homan once told The Washington Post that he started every day reading media reports about immigration. And what he read frustrated him: \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what we do or how we do it.\u201d To that end, he has called for the need for weekly press briefings. Those have not yet started.

At the Munich Security Conference, Vice President Vance said German political coalitions that refuse to work with far right parties violate democracy. Loading... Feb. 15, 2025, 9:14 p.m. ET\n\t\n\n|\nMUNICH U.S. Vice President JD Vance met the leader of a German far-right party during a visit to Munich on Friday, nine days before a German election and after lecturing European leaders about the state of democracy. He said there is no place for \u201cfirewalls.\u201d Mr. Vance met with Alice Weidel, the co-leader and candidate for chancellor of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, his office said. Mainstream German parties say they won\u2019t work with the party, a stance often referred to as a \u201cfirewall.\u201d Polls put Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in second place going into the Feb. 23 election with about 20% support. News of the meeting came after top German officials pushed back hard against Mr. Vance\u2019s complaints about the state of democracy in Europe, with the defense minister calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d to draw a parallel with authoritarian governments. He and Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended German mainstream parties\u2019 firewall. Mr. Vance said Friday at the Munich Security Conference that he fears free speech is \u201cin retreat\u201d across the continent. \u201cTo many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don\u2019t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election,\u201d Mr. Vance said. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, speaking a couple of hours later, said he couldn\u2019t let the speech go without comment. \u201cIf I understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes,\u201d Mr. Pistorius said. \u201cThat is unacceptable, and it is not the Europe and not the democracy in which I live and am currently campaigning.\u201d Mr. Vance also told European leaders that \u201cif you\u2019re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.\u201d He said no democracy could survive telling millions of voters that their concerns \u201care invalid or unworthy of even being considered.\u201d \u201cDemocracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for firewalls.\u201d Mr. Pistorius countered that \u201cevery opinion has a voice in this democracy. It makes it possible for partly extremist parties like AfD to campaign completely normally, just like every other party.\u201d He noted that Weidel was on prime-time German television on Thursday night along with the other contenders. But he added that \u201cdemocracy doesn\u2019t mean that the loud minority is automatically right,\u201d and that \u201cdemocracy must be able to defend itself against the extremists who want to destroy it.\u201d Mr. Scholz posted on social network X to \u201cemphatically reject\u201d Mr. Vance\u2019s comments. \u201cOut of the experiences of Nazism, the democratic parties in Germany have a joint consensus \u2013 that is the firewall against extreme right-wing parties,\u201d he wrote. Bavarian governor Markus S\u00f6der \u2013 a prominent figure in Germany\u2019s center-right opposition bloc, which leads pre-election polls \u2013 told reporters that \u201cwe take every opinion seriously, but we decide ourselves with whom we form a coalition,\u201d German news agency dpa reported. In a post on X earlier Friday, Ms. Weidel wrote, \u201cExcellent speech! \u2018There\u2019s no room for firewalls!\u2019\u201d Mr. Vance\u2019s meeting with Ms. Weidel came after she was received on Wednesday by Hungary\u2019s right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The vice president\u2019s office said Mr. Vance also met Friday with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and opposition leader Friedrich Merz, while he met Mr. Scholz earlier this week when both were in Paris for a summit on artificial intelligence Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re took issue with how Mr. Vance urged European officials to stem irregular migration in Friday\u2019s speech. Mr. Vance said the European electorate didn\u2019t vote to open \u201cfloodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants.\u201d \u201cHe speaks as though we are not focused on immigration in Europe,\u201d Mr. Gahr St\u00f8re said. \u201cI mean, this is the big theme in every country, that we want to have control of our borders.\u201d He argued that Ukrainian refugees accounted for a significant increase in unvetted immigrants in recent years \u2013 and they were accepted \u201cbecause there is a bloody war going on, which he did not mention, which I think is not really addressing reality.\u201d Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review \u2013 under the charming heading of \u201cdo things that don\u2019t interest you\u201d: \u201cMany things that end up\u201d being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, \u201chave come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things \u2018boring\u2019 simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.\u201d If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We\u2019re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We\u2019re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I\u2019m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that\u2019s hard for the world to figure out. We\u2019re run by a church, but we\u2019re not only for church members and we\u2019re not about converting people. We\u2019re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper\u2019s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will make English the official language of the U.S., Fox News Digital confirmed Friday morning. Trump will sign the executive order later on Friday, which rescinds a mandate issued by former President Bill Clinton in 2000 that required federal agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers, a White House official shared with Fox News Digital. The U.S. has never had an official language across its nearly 250-year history, though every major document, including the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, has been written in English. About 180 of the 195 countries across the globe have official languages, leaving the U.S. as one of the few countries that has not officiated a language, a White House official shared. It will be left to individual federal agencies to assess whether to offer services in languages other than English, Fox Digital learned.

Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley breaks down a new diversity in hiring case being brought to the Supreme Court and a judge halting President Donald Trump's mass firings on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Five former defense secretaries issued a scathing letter on Thursday assailing President Donald Trump for firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officers. In an open letter published Thursday, former\u00a0Defense\u00a0Secretaries\u00a0James Mattis, Leon Panetta, Lloyd Austin, Chuck Hagel, and William Perry urged Congress to hold immediate hearings on Trump's recent firings of Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown and several other senior military leaders. They said senators should \"refuse to confirm\" any new DOD nominations in response to the firings. TRUMP ACCEPTS SECOND STATE VISIT TO UK, REVEALS LETTER FROM KING CHARLES Five former defense secretaries have criticized President Donald Trump in a letter for firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior military officers. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In the letter, they alleged that Trump\u2019s actions undermined \"our all-volunteer force and weaken our national security\" and they accused the president of trying to turn the apolitical U.S. military into an instrument of partisan politics and using firings, which extend to the top Army, Navy and Air Force lawyers, to do so. All defense secretaries but one, James Mattis, served under Democratic administrations. TRUMP SAYS \u2018I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE I SAID THAT' WHEN ASKED IF HE STILL THINKS ZELENSKYY IS A DICTATOR Trump announced the firings late on Friday, but his administration has yet to clarify in any detail what caused the unprecedented shakeup, which also included the dismissal of the head of the Navy, Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first female officer to lead a military service. All but one of the former defense secretaries who penned the letter to President Trump worked under Democratic administrations. (DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images) Air Force General C.Q. Brown was only the second Black officer to become Joint Chiefs chairman and he was less than halfway through his four-year term when he was let go. \"Mr. Trump's dismissals raise troubling questions about the administration's desire to politicize the military,\" they wrote. \"We, like many Americans - including many troops - are therefore left to conclude that these leaders are being fired for purely partisan reasons.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter. The former defense secretaries called on Congress to hold hearings to \"assess the national security implications\" of Trump's dismissals. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown was let go not even have way into his four-year term under the Trump administration. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) The letter cautioned that the actions at the Pentagon could deter Americans from choosing a life in the military, should their careers be judged through the lens of partisan politics. It could also have a chilling effect on speaking \"truth to power,\" they cautioned.

President Donald Trump filled two more roles within his administration late Thursday by announcing who will be serving as deputy secretary of commerce and under secretary of the Navy. Trump selected former Virginia congressional candidate, Hung Cao, to serve as the next under secretary of the Navy and former under secretary of energy for science, Paul Dabbar, to serve as deputy secretary of commerce. The president congratulated both men, who are Navy veterans and graduates of the United States Naval Academy, in separate Truth Social posts Thursday night. TRUMP REVEALS SLEW OF PICKS FOR BIG JOBS, INCLUDING FRIEND OF MIKE PENCE, BILLIONAIRE'S WIFE President Donald Trump appointed Hung Cao to under secretary of the Navy and Paul Dabbar to deputy secretary of commerce late Thursday. (Evan Vucci/AP) Cao, who came to the U.S. in 1975 after his family escaped Vietnam shortly before the fall of Saigon, most recently ran for U.S. Senate in Virginia against Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine during the 2024 election, losing to the incumbent senator. He was endorsed by Trump during the race. He retired from the Navy as a captain after 25 years in Special Operations. While Cao served in combat roles, he also worked at the Pentagon and was assigned to balancing the Navy's $140 billion budget. \"Hung is the embodiment of the American Dream. As a refugee to our Great Nation, Hung worked tirelessly to make proud the Country that gave his family a home. He went to our amazing United States Naval Academy, and later earned his Master\u2019s Degree in Physics. Hung served in combat as a Special Operations Officer for twenty five years. With Hung\u2019s experience both in combat, and in the Pentagon, he will get the job done. Congratulations to Hung, and his wonderful family!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Cao thanked the president for selecting him in a post on X and said \"let's get to work.\" Hung Cao ran for U.S. Senate in Virginia against Democrat incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine during the 2024 race.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. An audit requested by state GOP lawmakers shows Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s administration underestimated costs and demand for illegal immigrant health programs, totaling $1.6B. Illinois taxpayers paid out $1.6 billion for healthcare programs for illegal immigrants since 2020, well above the spending projections estimated by Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s administration, per a new state audit released this week at the request of GOP legislators. The audit also found that, in many cases, state money was spent on people who were actually U.S. citizens or otherwise eligible for federal programs. \"This audit shows that the governor, that the program was rampant in overspending. It spent well in excess of 200% more than what was estimated in budgets and in appropriations,\" state Senate Republican leader John Curran told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"And it also showed that the governor was unable to manage this program,\" he said. \"Thousands of people were allowed to sign up for free healthcare for years on the state taxpayer dime that should not have been eligible under the parameters laid out for this program, and the governor failed to even seek federal reimbursement when eligible on certain services for years, leaving federal dollars on the table.\" ILLINOIS TO CUT STATE-FUNDED HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, GREEN CARD HOLDERS AFTER SOARING COSTS A new audit shows $1.6 billion in Illinois taxpayer funds went to healthcare programs for illegal immigrants under the Pritzker administration. Shown here are Gov. JB Pritzker, left, and state Senate Republican leader John Curran. (Getty Images | Fox News Digital) Illinois Auditor General Frank J. Mautino flagged more than 6,000 people listed as \"undocumented\" in the programs but who had Social Security numbers, and some of those individuals may actually be legal permanent residents who are eligible for Medicaid, meaning the state could get federal funding for them. The state reviewed 94 cases and found that 19 should have been classified as legal residents instead of noncitizens. There were also nearly 700 people in the senior health program who were under 65. A review confirmed that many of the errors were due to incorrect birth dates, which were corrected later. Nearly 400 enrollees appeared to have been in the country for more than five years and should have qualified for Medicaid, the audit also found. The state acknowledged that some of those people were enrolled incorrectly, which cost the state federal matching funds. The report recommended that the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services seek federal reimbursement for the lost funds.

(U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) The auditor's report, which Curran dubbed \"gross mismanagement\" in a press conference, was released just one week after Pritzker suggested cutting funding for a program that offers Medicaid-like coverage to illegal immigrants under 65 or legal immigrants without a green card. The proposed reduction, expected to save $330 million, was a key part of Pritzker's strategy to address a more than $3 billion budget shortfall. \"The governor was papering over this large spending with tax increases over the last several years, as well as COVID relief funds being spent on this rather than actually trying to rein in spending in the state of Illinois,\" Curran said. \"Now that federal dollars have tapered off, we have a large budget deficit in Illinois this year and the governor is now being forced to try to end the program for all working adults.\" \"We cannot afford this,\" Curran continued. \"The state of Illinois, state taxpayers, should not be burdened with providing free healthcare, especially for [the] working-age population. People that should be out and working in paying taxes and getting healthcare in the marketplace, just like every other Illinois state taxpayer is doing, so we want to bring the program to an end.\" As of December, 41,505 individuals were enrolled in the two programs, part of the Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults program, which Pritzker has proposed cutting starting July 1.

(Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Despite Pritzker's plan to cut funding for healthcare programs, he said during a Wednesday press conference that he supports some kind of universal health coverage: \"The broader context is people need to get health care.\" He added, \"It\u2019s some evidence, anyway, that there are an awful lot of people out there that need coverage who aren\u2019t getting it or who will do anything to get it, and I think that\u2019s a sad state of affairs in our society.\" Curran said \"Pritzker, from day 1, is taking an adversarial approach to President Donald Trump and his administration, and that has really put Illinois and really the city of Chicago in focus.\" \"What we would like to see is a more cooperative tone,\" he said. Hundreds of illegal immigrants in Chicago, which is deemed a sanctuary city, have been detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement since Trump took office. Both Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson bucked Trump's mass deportation move, vowing in January to protect residents regardless of their immigration status.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer discusses his meeting with President Donald Trump, security guarantees for Ukraine and ending the Israel-Hamas war on 'Special Report.' Things got awkward when Vice President JD Vance remarked on his previous comments on Britain's free speech environment, just feet away from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during an Oval Office meeting. Vance doubled down on his comments at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month when he said he feared that free speech was \"in retreat\" in Europe. \"To many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don\u2019t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election,\" Vance said.

(Carl Court/Pool via AP) On Thursday, as Starmer met with President Donald Trump and administration officials at the White House, Vance stood by his comments. \"I said what I said, which is that we do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies,\" he said. \"But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British. Of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them,\" Vance added. \"But (it also affects) American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens. So, that is something that we\u2019ll talk about today at lunch.\" VANCE EVISCERATES 'SOVIET'-STYLE EUROPEAN CENSORSHIP IN ADDRESS TO MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE Trump shakes hands with Starmer at the White House. (Carl Court/Pool via AP) Starmer, seated just a few feet away next to Trump, quickly chimed in. \"We\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time,\" the Labour Party politician said. \"Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across, and [regulate] U.S. citizens, and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\" he told Vance. \"But in relation to free speech in the U.K., I\u2019m really proud of that \u2014 our history there.\" In Munich, Vance cited the case of a British army veteran who was convicted of breaching a safe zone around an abortion clinic where he silently prayed outside.

        "title": "Trump questioned about Zelenskyy 'dictator' comment - and says he will visit UK soon | Politics News | Sky News",
        "text": "Sir Keir Starmer and the US president put up a united front ahead of crucial talks on Ukraine's future and trade with the UK. Political reporter\n              @alexrogerssky Thursday 27 February 2025 22:00, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Donald Trump has questioned whether he ever called President Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" \u00a0- after he was invited by King Charles for an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK. Sir Keir Starmer presented the US president with a copy of the invitation while the pair met in the Oval Office. The prime minister and his US counterpart shared warm words as they spoke ahead of a press conference in which they are expected to reveal details of their discussions on the Ukraine war and trade. Politics latest: Trump asks Starmer if the UK could take on Russia by itself Mr Trump called Sir Keir a \"special man\" and a \"great gentleman\" as he said he would be visiting the UK in the \"near future\". Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office, President Trump said it was a \"great honour to have Prime Minister Starmer at the Oval Office\". \"It's a very special place, and he's a special man - and the United Kingdom is a wonderful country that I know very well, I'm there a lot.\" He said the pair would discuss the Russia-Ukraine war, trade, and \"lots of other items\". \"And I think we can say we are going to be getting along on every one of them,\" the president added. Analysis: 'That was a lot': Inside the Oval Office with Donald Trump and Keir Starmer Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 'A backstop, you could say' Sir Keir also made opening remarks and praised Mr Trump for \"changing the conversation\" on Ukraine \"to bring about the possibility that now we can have a peace deal\". \"We want to work with you to make sure that this deal, is enduring, that it lasts, that it's a deal that goes down as a historic deal that nobody breaches,\" he said. \"And we'll work with you, to make sure that that absolutely happens.\" The condition of a US security \"backstop\" to deter Vladimir Putin from future aggression has been a key demand of the UK and European allies, with the prime minister saying it was the only path to peace in Ukraine. There had been concern that Mr Trump would stop short of providing the commitment after he said cryptically that he would not \"make security guarantees beyond very much\". Later in the exchange, Mr Trump appeared to suggest that a planned deal on minerals with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy would effectively be a security \"backstop\". \"President Zelenskyy is coming to see me on Friday morning. And we're going be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it's really going to get us into that country, working there,\" he said. He added it was a \"backstop, you could say\". However, in an awkward moment, the president spoke warmly of his relationship with Putin, saying he had a \"very good relationship\" with him as well as Mr Zelenskyy. And asked why he appeared to trust Putin when Sir Keir did not, Mr Trump replied: \"I know a lot of people that you would say no chance that they would ever deceive you, and they are the worst people in the world. \"I know others that you would guarantee they would deceive you, and you know what, they're 100% honourable, so you never know what you're getting. \"No, I have confidence that if we make a deal, it's going to hold.\" 'We've had free speech for a long time' There was also some disruption to the positive mood music in the form of US Vice President JD Vance, who challenged the prime minister on what he called \"infringements on free speech\" in the UK. Sir Keir issued a swift rebuttal to Mr Vance, saying: \"Well, we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time. \"Certainly, we wouldn't want to reach across US citizens, and we don't, and that's absolutely right - but in relation to free speech in the UK I'm very proud of our history there.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 'Did I say that?' The apparent positive exchange bodes well for the prime minister, who has been seeking to act as a bridge between the US and Europe, who appear to be increasingly at odds over the ongoing war in Ukraine. Mr Trump stunned Ukraine and European leaders earlier this month when he announced he had called Mr Putin - a pariah on the international stage - to discuss ending the war, without consulting them. Talks were then held between top US and Russian officials in Saudia Arabia with the aim of restoring ties and setting up negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. A series of controversial statements made by the president - including that Ukraine started the war and that President Zelenskyy was a \"dictator\" because he had not held elections during the war - also sparked fear that the US would reach a deal with Russia that would have been damaging to Ukraine. Asked by a journalist to repeat his statement about the Ukrainian president, Mr Trump said: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\" Chagos deal 'doesn't sound bad' In another positive sign for Sir Keir, the US president appeared to speak approvingly of the contentious Chagos Islands deal, in which the Indian Ocean archipelago would be transferred to Mauritius after a decades-long dispute. The agreement includes the tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, home to a UK-US military base that plays a crucial role in the region's stability and international security. Read more:Two reasons why Starmer's meeting with Trump really mattersBritain remains vulnerable with an unpredictable Trump Under the proposed agreement, the UK would lease back Diego Garcia for 99 years at a reported annual cost of around \u00a390m. Although the Biden administration welcomed the deal as a \"win for diplomacy\", Mr Trump's White House had expressed reservations about the deal owing to its concerns over China's influence in Mauritius. The US president was asked whether he agreed with the deal, to which he replied: \"Well, we're going to have some discussions about that very soon.\" He added: \"I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country. We have to be given the details, but it doesn't sound bad.\" Mr Trump's invitation from the King would be the second state visit to the UK after former prime minister Theresa May made a similar gesture to Sir Keir in 2017.",

        "text": "Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone has been pulled from iPlayer and will not be broadcast again, the BBC has said. It featured narration from the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Friday 28 February 2025 11:58, UK The government has called an \"urgent meeting\" with the head of the BBC over a controversial documentary about Gaza. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said she will be meeting with the chair of the corporation today to get \"assurances that no stone will be left unturned\" in the inquiry into the programme. Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone has been pulled from iPlayer and will not be broadcast on channels again after it emerged that the child narrator is the son of Ayman Alyazouri, who has worked as Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Politics latest: What did Starmer and Trump gift each other? In a statement, the BBC confirmed the family had been paid for the work. The corporation said the documentary was made on commission by a company called Hoyo Films, and that Hoyo did not say the narrator had links to Hamas despite being asked and knowing it to be the case. Ms Nandy said: \"The BBC has acknowledged serious failings by them and the production company Hoyo Films. \"The public rightly holds the BBC to the highest standards of reporting and governance which is why I will be having an urgent meeting with the BBC Chair later today. I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC's director general. \"This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case. It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.\" Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew raised concerns that public funds had \"indirectly supported a terrorist organisation\", and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to the BBC calling for an inquiry into \"the BBC's entire pattern of systemic bias against Israel\". After the discovery about the father of 13-year-old Abdullah al Yazouri, who speaks about life in Gaza during the war between Israel and Hamas, the BBC added a disclaimer to the programme and later removed it from its online catch-up service. In a statement released last night, a BBC spokesperson said \"serious flaws\" had been found in the making of the documentary. \"Some of these were made by the production company, and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable,\" they added. \"BBC News takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation. We apologise for this.\" It went on: \"Although the programme was made by an independent production company, who were commissioned to deliver a fully compliant documentary, the BBC has ultimate editorial responsibility for this programme as broadcast.\" Turning to Hoyo Films, the spokesperson said: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC, about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas. \"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact. \"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\" Read more:Trump shares AI video of Gaza visionHostage 'tortured and starved' in GazaSix newborns die from severe cold in Gaza Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Hoyo Films have told us that they paid the boy's mother, via his sister's bank account, a limited sum of money for the narration. \"While Hoyo Films have assured us that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift, the BBC is seeking additional assurance around the budget of the programme and will undertake a full audit of expenditure. \"We are requesting the relevant financial accounts of the production company in order to do that.\" The spokesperson said complaints about the programme will be expedited, and will be adjudicated by an independent reviewer.

Friday 28 February 2025 08:22, UK More patients in England will be able to book appointments online and request to see their regular doctor as part of a new deal agreed with GPs in England, the government has said. The deal includes an additional \u00a3889m in funding for the year 2025 to 2026 and is designed to end the \"8am scramble\" for appointments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Sky News it would \"modernise the way that people can book appointments\" and \"bring back the family-doctor relationship\". He said it was \"slashing the red tape that ties GPs up\" and had \"almost halved the number of measures and bureaucracy that GPs have to undertake\". From October, the reforms will require GP surgeries to allow patients to request appointments online in a bid to free-up phone lines for urgent enquires and help end the 8am rush to book appointments over the phone. GPs will also be incentivised to identify patients who would benefit from seeing their regular doctor at every consultation. Targets, including those requiring surgeries to report on staff wellbeing meetings, have also been scrapped to allow doctors to spend more time treating patients. Announcing the agreement, Mr Streeting said: \"Today, we have taken the first step to fixing the front door to the NHS, bringing back the family doctor, and ending the 8am scramble. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared.

        "text": "Listen to Story The Karnataka BJP made a provocative statement, drawing parallels between Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar and Maharashtra\u2019s Eknath Shinde. \u201cThere are many in Congress who could be like Eknath Shinde, DK Shivakumar might be one of them,\u201d Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka said, suggesting that the Congress strongman could be on the verge of engineering a split within the party. Ashoka\u2019s remarks come amid heightened speculation over Shivakumar\u2019s proximity to the BJP, following his attendance at Isha Foundation\u2019s Mahashivratri event in Coimbatore, where Union Home Minister Amit Shah was also present. The Karnataka BJP leadership seized upon this, fuelling murmurs of infighting within the ruling Congress. Ashoka, sensing an opportunity to deepen the cracks, said on Thursday that he had long anticipated a leadership change within the Congress-led government, hinting that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah could soon make way for Shivakumar. Ashoka went a step further, asserting that a leadership transition was imminent and that he had even \u201cfixed the auspicious time\u201d for it\u2014November 16 this year. Meanwhile, state BJP chief BY Vijayendra said, \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that the infighting has increased in Congress. Everyone is targeting DK Shivakumar now.\u201d Ashoka, however, was more direct in his prediction. Declaring that Karnataka would soon have its own version of the Maharashtra upheaval that saw Shinde break away from the Shiv Sena. He claimed Shivakumar could well be the leader to align with the BJP and topple the Congress government. \u201cBut it is an internal matter of the Congress, and it is up to them whether they want to take disciplinary action against Shivakumar for going to Prayagraj to take a holy dip at the Kumbh and participating in Shivaratri celebrations, where he was in the same frame as Union Minister Amit Shah,\u201d Ashoka added. Shivakumar, however, dismissed all speculation of a political switch as baseless. On Wednesday, he categorically denied any plans to defect to the BJP, calling the claims \u201cBJP propaganda.\u201d \u201cI am a born Congressman and committed to leading the party to victory in the 2028 assembly elections,\u201d he asserted. As for his recent religious visits, Shivakumar downplayed their political significance, stating that his participation in the Kumbh and the Shivaratri celebrations in Coimbatore was a matter of personal faith and should not be misinterpreted.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Published - February 28, 2025 09:11 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]  State secretary M.V. Govindan did not rule out Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan heading a prospective third consecutive Left Democratic Front (LDF) government after the 2026 Assembly elections. Speaking to newspersons at the AKG Centre, Mr. Govindan said the CPI(M)\u00a0 had consented to waive the two-term limit for party members holding high public office. \u201cThe exception for Mr. Vijayan has been the case. It is not anything new. Mr. Vijayan heads the only CPI(M) government in the country. He led the LDF to a second consecutive victory in 2021. However, the LDF does not follow the practice of announcing its Chief Minister candidate before the polls. The party fights elections based on the LDF\u2019s welfare and development manifesto,\u201d he said. He said Mr. Vijayan would present the CPI(M)\u2018s vision for a modern Kerala at the party\u2019s State conference in Kollam in March. The vision statement would inform the LDF\u2019s policy declaration for the State\u2019s development ahead of the 2026 Assembly campaign. Mr. Govindan said the very nihilistic forces opposed to Kerala\u2019s development had instigated a section of the ASHAs to protest against the government. He blamed the Socialist Unity Centre of India, Social Democratic Party of India, and Jamaat-e-Islami for causing disaffection among a section of ASHAs. \u201cThe very forces had tried to resist the GAIL pipeline project and acquisition of land in north Kerala for the National Highway development. Their anarchist bid to retard the State\u2019s development failed,\u201d he added. Mr. Govindan said the CPI(M) was not against ASHAs. Since coming to power in 2016, the LDF has increased theirhonorarium by \u20b91,000 annually. The government has not defaulted on paying ASHAs despite the Union government cutting back on its allocation for a National Health Mission programme. \u201cThe Union government owed \u20b9100 crore in ASHAs honorarium to the State government. Despite serious financial constraints, the LDF has ensured that ASHAs remained compensated,\u201d he said. Mr. Govindan also criticised the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) for rejecting the LDF\u2019s call for a joint agitation against the Centre\u2019s decision to permit corporations to mine the mineral-rich sea bed off Kerala\u2019s coast. He also denied the UDF\u2019s accusation that the LDF government had shepherded corporates who arrived in the State to explore off-shore industrial mining prospects for their investors. Mr. Govindan said the government had strongly objected to the move in meetings initiated by the Centre.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 28, 2025 09:16 pm IST - KOLKATA Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar addressed the gathering at the closing ceremony of the 150th Advent Commemoration of Gaudiya Mission\u2019s founder, Acharya Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad Ji at Science City in Kolkata, West Bengal on February 28, 2025. \n                                          | Photo Credit: X/@VPIndia Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar on Friday (February 28, 2025), during his visit to Kolkata emphasised the importance of the preservation of sustenance of Indian culture, especially through Sanatana\u00a0Dharma. Also Read:The many cultures of India \u201cThere is no other country in the world with such great reserves of knowledge, whose culture is over 5,000 years old. India is the spiritual centre of the world\u2026 We will have to act in a manner to protect, preserve, and to some extent, retrieve and revitalise our civilisation and value system. All answers can be found in Sanatana Dharma,\u201d he said. He added that being Indian is the people\u2019s identity and patriotism is the people\u2019s dharma. \u201cNo one is above the country and its values. Personal politics is beneath it,\u201d he said during his address at the closing ceremony of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of the founder of Gaudiya Mission, Acharya Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad, in Kolkata on Friday. On Friday, during his one-day visit to West Bengal, Mr. Dhankhar presided over the event by Gaudiya Mission at Kolkata and later offered prayers at the Tarapeeth temple. This was his first public appearance in West Bengal since assuming office as the 14th Vice President of India. Notably, Mr. Dhankhar served as the Governor of West Bengal between 2019 and 2022, before assuming office as the Vice President. The Vice President also said there is an atmosphere of intolerance and dissonance, which he claimed goes against the core values of Indian culture. \u201cNowadays people cannot tolerate each other. There is an atmosphere of conflict. People are quick to disagree with one another,\u201d Mr. Dhankar said. In his address, which followed that of the current Governor of West Bengal C.V. Ananda Bose, Mr. Dhankar called Kolkata \u201cthe epicentre of culture\u201d and highlighted the role of Bengal in the nation\u2019s spiritual and cultural history. \u201cIndia is the cultural centre of the world and Kolkata is one of the epicentres of culture. This land has witnessed contributions of spiritual luminaries Shri Chaitanya Maharaj, Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Vivekananda, and karmayogis Subhas Chandra Bose, Khudiram Bose, Chittaranjan Das, and stalwarts like Rabindranath Tagore, Abanindranath\u2026 this is the land of Syama Prasad Mukherjee,\u201d Mr. Dhankar said, addressing an audience during the closing ceremony of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of the founder of Gaudiya Mission, Acharya Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad. He added that Bengal has major contributions to India\u2019s fight for freedom. \u201cI saw Indian culture in its most superior form in Kolkata. During COVID, no one hesitated to help each other here,\u201d he also said. In his address, Mr. Dhankhar also recalled that India has survived many brutal attacks and transgressions throughout its history. \u201cWhat kind of barbarity, enormity, extremity of reckless destruction of our religious faces, our symbols of culture we have witnessed. Imagine when Nalanda was set on fire, there were lakhs of books. Those belonged just not to India but to the world,\u201d he said. Governor C.V. Ananda Bose also shared similar sentiments at the programme. \u201cIndia is recognised as a prominent spiritual centre. Kolkata, a historic spiritual and cultural hub has been at the heart of many discussions... However, if we lose our traditions, we lose ourselves. Ideological subversion is a real threat - we must stay vigilant,\u201d he said. He added that Sanatana Dharma stands for inclusivity, universal well-being, and moral strength. \u201cIt is our duty to preserve and propagate it. India\u2019s spiritual fabric is its greatest strength. We must protect it - not just for ourselves but for the world,\u201d Mr Bose said. After the Gaudiya Mission event, Mr. Dhankar and his spouse offered prayers at the renowned Shaktipeeth temple at Tarapeeth in West Bengal\u2019s Birbhum district. The Vice President wrote on the social media platform X, \u201cI received the divine blessings of Maa Tara at the sacred Tarapeeth temple in Birbhum. This Shaktipeeth is a symbol of our rich cultural heritage and ancient traditions. At the feet of the Goddess, I pray for the progress of India and the welfare of all our people.\u201d Published - February 28, 2025 09:06 pm IST culture (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history and culture\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kolkata\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        West Bengal Copyright\u00a9 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

February 28, 2025e-Paper Published - February 28, 2025 09:05 pm IST - ALAPPUZHA Thomas K. Thomas Kuttanad MLA Thomas K. Thomas has been appointed as the president of the Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar [NCP(SP)] Kerala unit. The formal announcement was made by party national president Sharad Pawar on Friday. Party leaders P.M. Suresh Babu and P.K. Rajan have been named as working presidents. Speaking to media persons, Mr. Thomas expressed his happiness at leading NCP(SP) in Kerala. \u201cThere are no major issues within the party. As president, I will focus on unity and strengthening the party,\u201d Mr. Thomas said, adding that he would soon meet Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He also dismissed discussions on replacing NCP(SP)\u2018s nominee in the State Cabinet, calling it a closed chapter. The decision to appoint Mr. Thomas as the party\u2019s Kerala chief was made two weeks ago during a meeting in Mumbai, which was attended by Mr. Pawar, State Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran, party leader P.C. Chacko and Mr. Thomas. Later, on February 25, NCP(SP) national general secretary Jitendra Awhad held discussions with the party\u2019s State leaders. The majority of them supported Mr. Thomas for the position. Earlier in February, infighting within the party Kerala unit led to P.C. Chacko\u2019s resignation as the State president. Prior to that, Mr. Chacko attempted to replace Mr. Saseendran with Mr. Thomas as the party\u2019s representative in the State Cabinet. However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reportedly did not agree to it. Later, the Saseendran and Thomas factions joined hands, leading to Mr. Chacko\u2019s resignation.

During the election campaign, Merz triggered\u00a0heated debates with his plans to change migration policy and his repeated\u00a0promises\u00a0to \"secure the German border.\" However, he\u00a0did not mention \"closing the border.\" Weidel's claim that\u00a0Merz\u00a0was breaking election pledges was posted alongside a video where he spoke of a plan to tighten border controls. Merz concluded his answer by saying:\u00a0\"I also want to make it very clear once again: none of us are talking about border closures. Nobody is. Although that was claimed at times during the election campaign, none of us want to close the borders.\" The video was originally shared by former Bild tabloid head Julian Reichelt. In his post on X, Reichelt suggests Merz\u00a0was contradicting\u00a0an earlier statement following a knife attack in Aschaffenburg in January 2025\u00a0in which an Afghan deportee killed two people. Following that\u00a0attack, Merz\u00a0said:\u00a0\"There will be a de facto ban on entry into\u00a0Germany for anyone who does not have valid entry documents. This also expressly applies to persons entitled to protection.\" In a live statement on 23 January 2025, Merz had also outlined his plans to take a tough stance on immigration.\u00a0\"On my first day in office, I would\u00a0instruct the Federal Ministry of the Interior to permanently control Germany's national borders with all of our neighbors and reject all attempts at illegal entry without exception.\" The so-called \"Five Point Plan\" of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group (\"Five points for secure borders and the end of illegal migration\"), the motion for a resolution that was passed in the Bundestag at the end of January with votes from the AfD, also talks about \"securing Germany's borders\" and \"permanent border controls.\" However, the\u00a0word \"border closure\" was\u00a0not mentioned in the document. Nevertheless, some media have interpreted Merz's statement as a promise to \"close the border\": The Austrian medium Der Standard ran the headline: \"CDU leader Merz meets resistance in Germany with plans to close the border.\" And the German daily TAZ\u00a0wrote: \"Immediate program of the Union foresees\u00a0border closure.\" \"I understand a 'border closure' to mean an almost comprehensive travel ban, as was the case during the coronavirus pandemic,\" commented European law expert Daniel Thym from the University of Konstanz when asked by DW. \"Friedrich Merz never promised that. It was 'only' about the permanent extension of border controls, which have been in place at most German borders for a year now, without these borders being 'closed.' Merz also wants to turn back asylum seekers. This is tantamount to a de facto entry ban for this group.\" Germany's Interior Ministry ordered internal border controlsat all German land borders in mid-September 2024. The controls were brought in as\u00a0a temporary measure against irregular migration and people smuggling and\u00a0have since been extended until September 15, 2025. According to the\u00a0Interior Ministry, this order is based on the provisions of Art. 25 et seq. of the Schengen Borders Code and is only possible as a last resort under strict conditions. Germany justified the border controls to the EU Commission with \"serious threats to public safety and order due to persistently high levels of irregular migration and migrant smuggling as well as the strain on the asylum reception system.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This makes Germany one of the countries in the Schengen area that currently carry out border controls, along with the Netherlands, France, Austria, Italy, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In exceptional circumstances, countries may only extend the reintroduction of internal border controls three times in six months, so that a maximum duration of two years is not exceeded. By updating the Schengen Borders Code, it is also possible to extend controls by a further year in serious exceptional situations. Germany would therefore have to lift internal border controls at its land borders by fall 2027 at the latest. Third-country nationals seeking protection, for example,\u00a0people seeking asylum from outside the EU, will continue to be forwarded to the responsible reception facility in Germany. They are responsible for examining their\u00a0asylum status and transferring people to other EU member states. Merz's approach of rejecting\u00a0asylum seekers without any checks contravenes\u00a0the\u00a0EU's Dublin III Regulation. Article 3\u00a0of this regulation states: \"Member States shall examine any application for international protection lodged by a third-country national or a stateless person on the territory of a Member State, including at the border or in transit zones.\u201d European law expert Daniel Thym says it is still too early to assess whether\u00a0Friedrich Merz can implement all of his election promises. Only once the new government has been\u00a0formed will it be clear what concrete steps it\u00a0intends to take. Thym points out that in their election manifesto, the CDU/CSU wants to make internal border controls superfluous through a functioning EU external border control system. Effective border protection at the EU's external borders with uniform standards for registration and responsibilities, as well as a mandatory solidarity mechanism, are part of the reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), adopted in May 2024. This means that in the future, people will be checked and registered at the EU's outer borders. Anyone with little prospect of protection in the EU will have an\u00a0asylum procedure at the borders within a maximum of seven days, and will have to leave\u00a0if their application is rejected. These new regulations are due to come into force in June 2026 at the latest. This article was originally published in German.",

        "text": "A new youth-led party wants to reshape the political landscape in a country that has been grappling with unrest since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina last August. Students who played a major role in ousting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government last year have announced the formation of a new political faction which aims to shake up the political landscape in the South Asian country. The National Citizen Party (NCP) will be headed by Nahid Islam, one of the best-known protest leaders. Until recently, he served as an adviser to the interim government \u2014\u00a0led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus \u2014\u00a0that took charge of Bangladesh after Hasina's exit. Addressing a public rally in the capital Dhaka on Friday, Islam said, \"We believe the July 2024 uprising initiated the fight towards a second republic. By writing a new democratic constitution, we must eliminate any possibility of future constitutional autocracy.\" Bangladesh has been grappling with political infighting since Hasina fled following weeks of mass, anti-government protests during which over 1,000 people were killed.\u00a0Hasina currently remains in self-imposed exile in neighboring India. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Since gaining independence from Pakistan in 1971, two parties \u2014\u00a0Hasina's Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of her rival Khaleda Zia \u2014\u00a0have dominated\u00a0Bangladeshi politics, while smaller leftist and Islamic parties have struggled to gain significant voter support. The AL and the BNP have governed the country for most of the past three decades. And they have been accused of widespread corruption and authoritarianism as well as failing to act on issues such as\u00a0systemic inequality, discrimination and social injustice. Many Bangladeshis hope the new, youth-led party will now reshape the political landscape. Masud Kamal, a Dhaka-based political analyst, said Bangladeshis have so far had limited options on the ballot. \"The emergence of a third or fourth force could provide much-needed relief for the electorate,\"\u00a0he told DW. However, he is uncertain whether the NCP will achieve electoral success. Politics in Bangladesh are notoriously fractious. NCP representative Akhtar Hossain has said his party emphasizes \"participatory politics\"\u00a0and rejects both Islamophobia and religious extremism in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. \"In Bangladesh, we've seen Islamophobia on one side and extremism on the other,\" he said. \"We don't want this kind of politics in our party. We're advocating for participatory politics, where the civic dignity of people is the primary concern.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Political analyst Kamal said the NCP still lacks a clear ideology, which he described as a \"weakness.\" \"I don't understand the new party's policy or its ideology,\"\u00a0he told DW, adding: \"They talk about participatory politics, but almost all the party leaders are students from Dhaka University. Yet, the mass uprising included workers, farmers, rickshaw pullers, and even housewives.\" He also cast doubt on the new party's popularity. \"Calculating a voter base based on social media popularity is a foolish approach,\" Kamal noted. \"A lot of people in remote areas of Bangladesh are quite angry about the activities of the newcomers. I think if the NCP contests the elections without forming an alliance, it will stand in third or fourth place in terms of seats,\" he stressed. With Hasina's Awami League weakened by her ouster, its traditional rivals from the BNP have\u00a0emerged as the most powerful party in the country. And the BNP is also likely to be the NCP's toughest opponent in the next general election, which is expected to take place in late 2025 or early 2026. Samantha Sharmin from the new NCP party recently criticized the BNP, without naming it, for being an obstacle to \"unity.\" \"All our efforts to create national unity after the fall of Sheikh Hasina have been thwarted and obstructed by a party that considers itself the biggest party in Bangladesh,\" she told DW last week. The BNP has rejected the allegations, stating that it is focused on contesting the next elections and returning power to the people. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video BNP politician Harunur Rashid welcomed the formation of the NCP but doesn't see it as posing a challenge for his party. \"BNP has proven itself to the people. The NCP needs to wait a long time to gain the momentum to compete with us,\" he said. There are also disagreements between the NCP and the BNP over the elections, with NCP leaders calling for electing a new constituent assembly to draft a new constitution, while the BNP is favor of holding parliamentary elections first. Furthermore, the NCP wants the interim government to ban Hasina's Awami League, a demand that has so far not been supported by the BNP. The more established party has maintained that elections must decide the AL's fate. Sharmin has slammed the BNP's stance, saying that it's tantamount to \"playing with the people's emotions,\u201d \"betraying the spirit of the 2024 uprising,\u201d and \"keeping the otherwise irrelevant Awami League's hopes alive.\" Kamal warned that excluding the Awami League from elections could actually lead to a disaster for the NCP, as the AL's share of the vote \u2014 somewhere between\u00a030% and 35% \u2014 might shift to the BNP, potentially making it the largest party in Bangladeshi history.

        "text": "Riot police deployed tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a smaller group of protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and stones. Protesters have alleged that the government was involved in a cover-up of the deadly crash. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Athens in a demonstration to mark the second anniversary of a rail accident that killed 57. Greek riot police deployed tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a smaller group of protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and stones. Protesters have alleged that the government was involved in a cover-up of evidence, slowing down investigations into the crash. Over 170,000 people attended the protest in Athens, and some 325,000 people in total took to the streets nationwide, according to police. A total of 5,000 police officers have been deployed in the capital. Police said that between 500 and 700 people were involved in riots. Police arrested over 80 individuals. Riots also broke out in Greece's second-most populous city of Thessaloniki. Greece's ambulance service said some nine people were taken to hospital, including a photographer that had been hit in the head by a stun grenade. Alongside the protests, private-sector unions kicked off a 24-hour general strike, which paralyzed public transport and caused the closure of government offices and schools. Shops and businesses across the country also closed for several hours. GSEE, the biggest private-sector union, said it had called the strike \"so that the rule of law can finally be implemented; so that there is no cover-up; so that those responsible are punished.\" Protesters on Friday marked the second anniversary of the Tempi railway disaster, in which a passenger train from Athens to Thessaloniki collided with a freight train. 57 people died in the crash, including many students, and many more were injured. The two trains had traveled toward each other for miles without triggering any alarms. Polls indicate that between 70-80% of Greeks believe that the government was involved in a cover-up of evidence suggesting insufficient safety measures. An experts' report funded by victims' families has claimed the freight train was carrying an illegal and unreported load of explosive chemicals. The Hellenic Train operator has denied knowledge of any illegal cargo on the train. The government has denied allegations of a cover-up and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has dismissed calls to resign, accusing critics of attempts to \"destabilize\" the country. Greece's opposition parties are\u00a0set to call a no-confidence vote next week. Edited by: Rana Taha",

        "title": "Poland temporarily suspends right to asylum \u2013 DW \u2013 02/28/2025",
        "text": "Poland's parliament has approved a bill that permits the temporary suspension of asylum rights to curb irregular migration from Belarus in particular. Experts say it violates human rights and the Polish Constitution. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk considers his country to be under threat. The source of this threat is not just Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, but also migration to Poland from neighboring Belarus that is being orchestrated by that country and Russia. \"We are dealing with a new form of migration where authoritarian regimes are organizing human smuggling on a large scale,\" Tusk said in Brussels last October. Heads of governments from across the EU spoke at the time of a \"weaponization of migrants\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The situation began in 2021, when the number of attempted border crossings along the 418-kilometer (260-mile) Polish-Belarusian border suddenly rocketed. People from the Middle East, Asia and Africa came to Belarus on tourist visas and were brought straight to the Polish border, in many cases by Belarusian soldiers. Although Warsaw has since reinforced the border with barbed-wire fences, many migrants still attempt to use this route to enter the EU. The award-winning Polish director Agnieszka Holland described the appalling conditions on Poland's \"green border\" in her 2023 film of the same name. Poland's border guards have been accused of turning away people without allowing them to apply for international protection. Polish courts have repeatedly confirmed and condemned illegal pushbacks at the border. Donald Tusk now wants to address the matter by amending Polish asylum law to allow the temporary suspension of the right to claim asylum. On February 21, 386 lawmakers in the 460-seat Sejm, the lower house of the Polish parliament, approved a bill that would amend the country's asylum law in this way. If signed into law, the amendment would permit the suspension of the right to apply for international protection \"if instrumentalization of migration is taking place\" and if these actions constitute \"a serious and real threat to the security of the state or society.\" The new rule would not apply to minors, pregnant women, elderly or sick people or people who are persecuted in the neighboring country \u2014 in other words in Belarus. This persecution would, however, have to be proven first. The bill would allow the government to decree the suspension of asylum rights for up to 60 days. An extension would have to be approved by parliament. While some legal experts and left-wing lawmakers spoke of a violation of human rights, Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Duszczyk told the relevant parliamentary committee, \"We are only talking about suspending the rights of migrants. There is a grading of civil rights, of human rights. There is a state whose citizens have priority.\" Duszczyk went on to say that he didn't believe \"that a border guard who sees a mother with a child would refuse them entry to Poland. Such situations could simply not happen.\" The Association for Legal Intervention responded to the deputy minister's remarks with a strongly worded statement on Facebook: \"Mr. Maciej Duszczyk seems to have a remarkably limited imagination and would not seem to read the newspapers either, because the border crossing Brest-Terespol [on the Belarusian border] has been notorious for just such situations as these for quite some time now \u2014 not to mention what is happening in the forests on the borders.\" The association went on to say that the situation at the border \"does not justify such radical steps and violations of fundamental human rights\" in view of the relatively small number of 2,700 applications for international protection received by the border guards in the northeastern region of Podlaskie last year. For Urszula Wolfram, head of the Podlaskie Volunteer Humanitarian Emergency Service (POPH), the new rule is nothing more than \"a legalization of the current pushback practice\" of\u00a0the Polish authorities. \"How is that supposed to work?\" she asked, speaking to DW in Warsaw. \"Are the border guards supposed to just look people in the eye and then decide for themselves whether the people have a claim to international protection?\" Wolfram points out that it is not up to border guards to decide who has a right to international protection: \"In Poland, that's the job of the Immigration Office.\" Lawyer Hanna Machinska of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights and Poland's former deputy commissioner for human rights speaks of a \"drastic violation of international law.\" \"The law breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. So, if it comes to a case before the European Court of Human Rights, Poland will lose that case,\" she said. Machinska added that it was also a breach of the Polish Constitution, which guarantees the right to asylum. She considers the move purely political and says that with this anti-migration law, Tusk is trying to appeal to voters on the right. \"But you cannot act against the opposition by breaking international law,\" said Machinska. Poland will elect a new president in May. Whether the new anti-migration law will help Rafal Trzaskowski, the candidate backed by Donald Tusk's Civic Platform (PO), get more votes is impossible to say. What is certain is that the pro-European mayor of Warsaw has adopted new rhetoric in his election campaign. \"No one in Europe should think that they will force us to do anything,\" he said in an interview with the website interia.pl. He was referring to the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, which is due to come into force in 2026. Poland voted against the pact, arguing that its planned distribution of migrants within the EU\u00a0was unacceptable. Karol Nawrocki, the presidential candidate supported by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, has voiced his agreement with this position and\u00a0attacked\u00a0Germany. \"I do not agree with what is happening with migration policy in the European Union,\" he said at an election rally. \"As [future] president of Poland, I do not intend to tolerate the fact that our western neighbors, the Germans, regulate their problems, their mistakes regarding migration policy, risking the safety of our women and children in the process.\" With statements such as these, both politicians are hitting a nerve in Polish society. According to a poll conducted by broadcaster RMF24, 75% of respondents feel that Poland should not take in more migrants, 20% say it should, 5% are\u00a0undecided. The bill is now before the Senate, the upper house of the Polish parliament, where it is likely to be passed. If it does, the signature of conservative President Andrzej Duda can be considered a formality. The new law could, therefore, be in force by the time migrant numbers start to rise again in the spring. This article was originally published in German.",

        "title": "German election: Winning candidates angry over lost seats \u2013 DW \u2013 02/28/2025",
        "text": "Several German election candidates have cried foul as a new electoral reform meant they were left without a seat despite winning their district. The CDU/CSU wants to make electoral reform a condition of coalition talks. Volker Ulrich was in no mood for the usual magnanimous pleasantries on election night in Augsburg. The Bavarian politician, candidate for the Christian Social Union (CSU), had just discovered that, despite winning his constituency, he would not be entering parliament after all. That was down to an electoral reform introduced by the previous government in 2023: To reduce the unwieldy and increasingly costly size of the parliament, which reached a record 735 parliamentarians in 2021, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition of Social Democrats, Greens, and Free Democrats agreed to cap the number of Bundestag members at 630. Germans get two votes in each general election, designed to balance local representatives and national parties: The \"first\" vote is for their preferred local candidate, the \"second\" vote for the national party they support. As the party's overall representation \u2014 determined by the \"second vote\" \u2014 was not allowed to exceed their proportional representation in parliament, 23 candidates across Germany who won the most direct \"first votes\" for their seat couldn't enter parliament. One of these unlucky winners was Ulrich, and he was seething. So when Green Party candidate Claudia Roth\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who had voted with her party for the reform but was herself assured of a parliamentary seat via the second vote \u2014 came over to congratulate him, the winning conservative saw not green but red. In an ugly exchange captured on camera and inevitably uploaded to X, Ulrich refused to shake Roth's hand and told her: \"You are not a democrat!\" Ulrich later apologized for his outburst but maintained that his point was valid: The electoral reform passed by the previous government was \"unfair and undemocratic,\" he wrote on X. In the aftermath of the election, Friedrich Merz, leader of the victorious conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the CSU, vowed to overhaul the election reform. The likely next chancellor claimed it had been designed to disadvantage his bloc \u2014 because the CDU/CSU generally wins the most direct seats in German elections. Indeed, 18 of the 23 winning candidates deprived of a Bundestag seat on Sunday were from the CDU/CSU. In recent days, CSU leader Markus S\u00f6der has gone so far as to threaten to make scrapping the reform a condition in the upcoming coalition talks with the Social Democrats, claiming that his state of Bavaria\u00a0lost out. \"It was a final act of revenge by the government on southern Germany. We will change that again,\" he vowed to public broadcaster ARD. But that would come too late for Yannick Schwander, CDU candidate in Frankfurt, who won his district by a margin of only 0.3% of the vote. Since the new rules meant those with the narrowest wins were the first to miss out, he already knew his fate on election night. \"It was indeed very annoying,\" he told DW. \"I think the reform undermines one of the basic principles in a democracy: The person who gets the most votes gets the mandate. We keep talking about strengthening direct democracy in Germany, and this was an instrument of direct democracy that was undermined by this reform.\" But some experts aren't so sure. Sebastian J\u00e4ckle, political scientist at Freiburg University, who modelled various scenarios under the new rules, said that he could understand why winning-but-losing candidates felt hard done by, and that some voters are disgruntled, but said that the German constitution did not guarantee the direct representation that Schwander described. In fact, J\u00e4ckle points out that Article 38 of Germany's Basic Law says the opposite: \"All parliamentarians are representatives of the 'whole people,' and not any particular electoral district, so I think the criticism that the reform is undemocratic can't be supported,\" he told DW. Though the Bundestag is comprised of 299 directly-elected members and 331 PR members, there is no formal difference between them when it comes to their actual parliamentary work. But try telling that to any of the candidates who campaigned in their constituencies promising to \"represent the people of\" a certain town. In fact, some moderately-sized cities like Darmstadt ended up without any direct representatives in the new Bundestag at all. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The new rules raise another concern: The threat of further polarization.\u00a0Since the closest results tended to be in districts where there is a greater range of political views \u2014 often urban areas \u2014 candidates in those places tended to be more moderate to try to appeal to more voters. Schwander thinks this means that the reform will end up polarizing political debate in the new Bundestag over the next four years. \"Germany has always had a big divide between town and country,\" he said. \"Centrist parties like mine, the CDU/CSU, will now send more rural candidates into the Bundestag, who tend to be more conservative. At the same time, on the left, there will be more representatives from big cities who are significantly more left-wing, while pragmatic left-wing politicians from rural areas will miss out.\" Political scientist J\u00e4ckle agrees that this is not ideal: \"There is something to that,\" he said. \"We have a polarization between city and country in the Bundestag, between left and right, and that is a bit of a problem for democracy.\" Though there was a consensus that the Bundestag was too bloated, finding a compromise that everyone will be happy with won't be easy. One solution might be to simply reduce the number of electoral districts by making fewer, larger ones. But this would lead to complicated rows over how the new borders should be drawn. Bitter accusations of gerrymandering would be inevitable. \"One could also change the entire electoral law, by introducing parallel voting,\" said Schwander. Parallel voting means creating two entirely separate groups of parliamentarians that do not affect one another mathematically: One group is elected directly by district, the other nationally by proportional representation. Such a system has been proposed before, most recently in 2022, when the Bundestag was hashing out plans to reform the old system. It sounds simple enough, but it was opposed by smaller parties who felt their representation would be likely to suffer. \"All these systems have their advantages and disadvantages,\" said Schwander. \"But I think what is really important is that, if we do discuss a reform, that we include different viewpoints \u2014 the fact is we need to find a reform that on the one hand keeps the Bundestag as small as possible, but on other hand preserves the basic principle that an election victory leads to a mandate.\" Edited by Rina Goldenberg While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

        "text": "Friedrich Merz, Germany's likely next head of government, is already trying to shape foreign policy. He is especially concerned about Germany's ailing relationships with France and Poland. Just three days after the federal election victory of Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), the bloc's leader, Friedrich Merz, met with French President Emmanuel Macron for a private dinner in Paris. After the dinner, Merz posted in French and German on X : \"Thank you, dear Emmanuel Macron, for your friendship and your trust in Franco-German relations. Together, our countries can achieve great things for Europe.\" If he manages to forge a coalition government, Merz may come into office in a few weeks' time. Until then, Chancellor Olaf Scholz remains in office. But Merz is in a rush for a reason: US President Donald Trump may be on the verge of negotiating a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine. However, neither Ukraine nor the EU\u00a0are at the negotiating table, although Trump has said Europe should be responsible for subsequent security guarantees for Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Macron became the first European leader to visit Trump in Washington this week. However, he failed to make progress on Ukraine \u2014 and the US is still planning to impose its threatened import tariffs on European goods. Merz has accused the current German government of being too passive and letting German-Franco relations slide. \"We must change from being a sleeping middle power to being a leading middle power,\" said Merz in a keynote speech on foreign policy before the election. As head of government, he said he would prioritize reviving relations with France and Poland. The three countries together form what is called the \"Weimar Triangle,\"\u00a0which was formerly seen as an important alliance. During Scholz's center-left government \u2013 a coalition with the Greens and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) which came to office in 2021 \u2014 there was often tension with both France and Poland. While Poland's national-conservative\u00a0Law and Justice (PiS) government was in office, Berlin and Warsaw had completely different positions on migration and many social issues. Since the liberal Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office in 2023, relations have improved somewhat, but are still far from close. Poland has a prominent role in the first half of this year, since it holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and can therefore set its own European policy priorities. With regard to the situation in Ukraine, Polish Deputy Minister for European Affairs Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka told DW that, \"The most important motto of the Polish presidency is: Security in Europe.\u00a0At the moment, our primary goal is to keep Ukraine aid running,\" she added. And that is not a given: Countries such as Hungary and Slovakia identify more strongly with Donald Trump and want a normalization of relations with Moscow \u2014 even at Ukraine's expense. Sobkowiak-Czarnecka congratulated Germany's election winner, Friedrich Merz: \"We are close neighbors,\" she told DW. \"Cooperation with our partners in Germany is always very important to us, and we are happy about the new government.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video France is traditionally Germany's closest European partner. But relations have cooled considerably \u2014 not only because of disagreements within Germany's outgoing coalition government \u2014 but also due to the different personalities of Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron. While Scholz is sober and reserved, Macron is rousing and has big visions. Friedrich Merz and Emmanuel Macron now wish to make a new start in relations between their countries. However, there are potential obstacles. Until a new German government is formed, Merz may face some competition with the incumbent Chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Merz announced that he sent a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" to Scholz, in which he laid out clear guidelines on what the still-chancellor may and may not do, during his remaining time as head of government. The German daily newspaper, Bild, responded with the headline: \"Union wants to put Scholz on a leash!\" In addition, Macron is struggling domestically: With changing prime ministers, he is constantly worried about his parliamentary majority. If a new election were held in France today, opinion polls indicate that the far-right politician Marine Le Pen would win the race. While Merz and Macron agree they would like a Franco-German engine to motor the entire EU, not all EU members want to be driven by the \"big two nations.\"\u00a0And with the election of Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni \u2014 a Trump ally \u2014 an intra-European competitor has emerged. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video That is especially true for the current question of whether the EU would send peacekeeping ground troops to Ukraine to secure a peace deal between Trump and Putin. Macron is in favor. Merz is skeptical. And what about Poland? \"Each country should decide for itself \u2014 we don't do that at EU level,\" says Magdalena Sobkowiak-Czarnecka. \"But we have decided that we will not send troops to Ukraine. We can help Ukraine logistically and in other ways. But as a country bordering a war zone, we have to take care of our own security, first and foremost.\" EU leaders will be convening on March 6\u00a0in Brussels for a Ukraine crisis summit which will address aid for Ukraine. Merz will not be able to attend as German head of government, but incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to keep him informed during the transition phase. Whether Merz will manage to put German-French relations on a new track, remains to be seen in the coming months. This article was originally written in German.

        "text": "Friedrich Merz aims to swiftly form government after his conservative bloc's February 23 election win. SPD leader Lars Klingbeil stressed a coalition with the CDU/CSU was \"not automatic\" amid key policy disagreements. Germany's conservative CDU/CSU alliance on Friday began exploratory talks with the Social Democrats (SPD) aimed at forming a new government coalition. The CDU/CSU bloc is made up of likely future chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its smaller Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The conservative bloc came in first place in Germany's 23 February federal election, receiving some 28.5% of the vote. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD won just 16.4% in a historic low for the party. Merz has ruled out entering into coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which came in second place at 20.8%, and pledged to uphold the political \"firewall\" against the party. Friday's talks are expected to focus on setting a timetable for coalition negotiations. It is as of yet unclear when formal coalition talks will begin. Merz has said that he aims to form government before Easter.

The SPD has called for Germany's debt brake to be lifted in order to increase the federal budget, while the CDU/CSU has argued for keeping it in place while establishing a special fund for defense spending.

        "text": "Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said Friday it thwarted a Ukrainian-ordered plot to assassinate Metropolitan Tikhon Shevkunov, a senior Russian Orthodox Church bishop with close ties to President Vladimir Putin. Shevkunov, often described in media reports as \"Putin's confessor,\" has known the Russian leader personally since the 1990s and serves on his advisory council for culture and the arts. In 2014, he was appointed Metropolitan of Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine. The FSB said it had arrested a Ukrainian and a Russian man in Moscow on suspicion of planning the attack, alleging they were \"recruited by Ukraine's GUR intelligence service through Telegram.\" The state-run TASS news agency identified the suspects as Shevkunov's assistant, Denis Popovich, and fellow cleric Nikita Ivankovich. According to TASS, the two suspects received an improvised explosive device in December and planned to place it in the living quarters of Moscow's Sretensky Monastery while Shevkunov was visiting. The men were reportedly set to flee Moscow with false passports after the attack. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the alleged plot further evidence that \"the Kyiv regime does not shy away from anything. In this instance, nothing is sacred.\" Footage released by the Russian military broadcaster Zvezda appeared to show security forces detaining the suspects, including one being carried into a van and another lying face-down in a flat in handcuffs. Videos also purportedly showed them confessing. Ukraine has not commented on the allegations. Russia has seen multiple Russian or pro-Kremlin figures targeted in attacks over the past three years. Moscow has blamed Kyiv for most of them, including the December assassination of General Igor Kirillov. A Message from The Moscow Times: Dear readers, We are facing unprecedented challenges.

The probe, which found Israel's military had misjudged Hamas' intentions, is likely to put further pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's army has admitted its \"complete failure\" over the deadly 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, saying that it hugely underestimated the capabilities of the militant group. An investigation by the Israeli military released on Thursday said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had \"failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians\". The report could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the single deadliest attack in Israeli history, which triggered the now 16-month war in Gaza. The investigation's main findings were that the Israeli military misread Hamas' intentions, underestimated its strength, and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday. A main misconception was that Hamas, which took control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing than fighting Israel, the inquiry found. \"7 October was a complete failure,\" a senior Israeli army official said after the publication of the investigation. \"Too many civilians died that day asking themselves in their hearts or out loud, where was the IDF?\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In comments made to military commanders and shared with the media, the military's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said he took responsibility for the IDF's failures. \"I was the commander of the military on 7 October, and I have my own responsibility. I also carry the weight of all your responsibility \u2014 that, too, I see as mine,\" said Halevi, who announced his resignation in January and is set to step down next week. The attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Hamas abducted another 251. At least 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in Gaza since then, says the Hamas-run health ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The investigation said the perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision-makers away from taking action on 7 October that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence showed that the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar \u2014 who was killed last October \u2014 had started planning the attack as early as 2017. While the report did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, it is expected to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals. Besides Halevi, other high-ranking officers have resigned, such as the ex-head of military intelligence. Many Israelis believe the failures of 7 October extend beyond the army, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That approach included allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash into Gaza and sidelining Hamas' rival, the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu's administration has resisted appeals to open an inquiry into the government's responsibility for the attack, saying that it must wait until the war is over. The first phase of a three-stage ceasefire that began on 19 January is set to expire on Saturday. Talks between Israel and Hamas on the next phase are currently underway.",

        "title": "UK development minister resigns saying cuts will affect Gaza and Sudan | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "Anneliese Dodds, the UK's international development minister, has resigned after the government announced a massive cut of the international aid budget, which she said would likely impact programmes in Gaza and Sudan. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced plans to increase defence spending from 2 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent by 2027, with a target to hit 3 percent by the end of the next parliament. That would partly be funded, he announced, by slashing aid from 0.5 percent of gross national income to 0.3 percent. Dodds said on Friday that it would be \"impossible\" to deliver such aid cuts without it impacting programmes such as those in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine. She wrote in her resignation letter to Starmer that the postwar global order had \"come crashing down\" and that she agreed with increased defence spending. \"The tactical decision was taken for ODA [official development assistance] to absorb the entire burden. You have maintained that you want to continue support for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine; for vaccination; for climate; and for rules-based systems,\" she wrote. \"Yet it will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut;\u00a0the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.\" In September, Dodds wrote a column for Middle East Eye, in which she stated the plight of women and girls needed to be at the heart of the global response to the war in Sudan. The outgoing minister told Starmer that his decision would likely lead to the UK pulling out from African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations \"at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\". Dodds added that the UK would likely have to leave a number of multilateral bodies and have a reduced role in the G7, G20, World Bank and climate negotiations. \"I\u00a0know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID.\" Days earlier, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Britain would \"protect the most vital programmes in the world's worst conflict zones of Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan\", but other programmes doing vital work \"will have to be put on hold\". It was earlier this month that Lammy described Trump's decision to make large cuts in USAID was a \"big strategic mistake\" which would allow China to further its global influence. The Guardian reported on Friday that the cut would take overseas aid to its lowest percentage of national income since records began. Experts told the Guardian that aid programmes in Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nigeria are likely to be among those affected. On Thursday, 138 charities wrote to Starmer this week condemning the decision. \"It is alarming that the UK is now following in the US\u2019s footsteps and has accepted the false choice of cutting the already diminished UK aid to fund defence,\" they wrote. \"No government should balance its books on the backs of the world's most marginalised people. The previous UK aid cuts and the current US aid freeze have already shown their impact: children are now at risk of missing out on vaccines, girls may lose access to education, and healthcare services in refugee camps are being withdrawn.\" The charities said that in the long term, alternative funding could be secured through a wealth tax, while in the short term, the proceeds of the sale of Chelsea FC could be used. The football club was among a number of assets frozen from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovic after Russia invaded Ukraine. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Syrian Kurds say Ocalan\u2019s message 'has nothing to do with us' | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "Thousands of Kurds in northeast Syria headed to public squares on Thursday to listen to a long awaited message from Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey. In a historic statement,\u00a0Ocalan called on the group he founded to lay down its arms and disband. \"All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself,\" he said. Ocalan's call for \"all groups\" indicates that he likely means all PKK offshoots in Syria and Iran. Since 2012, Syrian Kurds have been able to carve out a semi-autonomous region in northeast Syria, which they refer to as Rojava, meaning Western Kurdistan. Turkey has repeatedly targeted the region, saying the US-backed\u00a0Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF),\u00a0the official military wing of Rojava, is an offshoot of the PKK, an armed group that has been fighting the Turkish state since 1984. The SDF\u00a0denies\u00a0links to the PKK. The Syrian Kurds hope that a renewed peace process in Turkey, which collapsed in July 2015, would bring greater stability and put an end to Turkish cross-border military operations and drone attacks. Syrian Kurdish officials travelled to Turkey for the last peace process, but have since been\u00a0branded terrorists. Although Ocalan did not mention Syria, the question for some is now whether the SDF will also disarm itself. Salih Muslim, an official from the Syrian Kurdish political party the Democratic Union Party (PYD),\u00a0told Al Arabiya that \"there will be no need for weapons if attacks against the Kurds come to an end.\" Samantha Teal, a researcher from the Syria-based Rojava Information Centre (RIC) told Middle East Eye that, \"SDF officials interviewed by RIC say paths such as simply laying down their weapons are impossible due to the current threats facing northeast Syria - primarily attacks from Turkey and the Turkish-backed SNA.\" On Thursday, SDF commander-in-chief Mazloum Abdi told reporters at a press conference in Washington DC that \"Ocalan\u2019s message concerns the PKK and has nothing to do with us in Syria.\" He also added that if there was peace in Turkey, \"there will be no justification for Turkey\u2019s attacks on us in Syria\". Officials of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) in Turkey\u00a0have also stated that Ocalan's call for disarmament was not for the SDF, Teal said. Sinam Mohamad, the representative of the SDF\u2019s political wing, the Syrian Democratic Council in the United States, told MEE that \"Ocalan\u2019s statement is a historic one, coming at a time when the Middle East is undergoing significant changes. At the end of any war or conflict, the best path forward is to pursue a peace agreement.\" Mohamad said the statement has brought the Kurdish issue to the international stage and called for a lasting solution. \"This statement will have a positive influence on Rojava and Syria. I hope it will bring peace and end the conflict against our people in northeast Syria... Let us work together in Syria to rebuild our country,\" she said. In Iraq, meanwhile, Jadaan Ali, the representative of Syria's Kurdish National Council (KNC) party in Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, also welcomed Ocalan's call. The KNC is aligned with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and has traditionally been a rival to the PYD and SDF. 'Paths such as simply laying down their weapons are impossible due to the current threats facing northeast Syria' -\u00a0Samantha Teal, Rojava Information Centre \"It has been a positive development, and we hope that the call for laying arms and disbanding the PKK brings peace and blessings to the Kurdish people. In our view, abandoning arms and entering civil and political processes is a positive development,\" he told MEE. \"The time of militancy is long gone. We also hope that this brings the Kurds in all Kurdish geography together through dialogue, democratic processes, elections, and local administrations.\" The KRG has also expressed support for a peace process in Turkey and has encouraged unity talks between the PYD and its Syrian Kurdish rival, the KNC. In mid January, the former president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Masoud Barzani, advised SDF leader Abdi to distance himself from the PKK during a meeting in Erbil. \"We've again taken a very proactive role, bringing the Kurds of Syria together with all the various political parties, not just with SDF, to have a unified force in Damascus to ensure that they are represented, that they are respected, and that they're part of a new government,\" said Treefa Aziz, the KRG representative to the US, speaking at a Kurdish conference at the University of Central Florida on Thursday. Analysts believe that a new peace process in Turkey will make it easier for the US to support the SDF. Former US ambassador Peter Galbraith, who also spoke in Florida, said that Ocalan\u2019s message should be a positive sign for Syrian Kurds. \"If the PKK disarms, and the Turkish argument that Rojava is an ally of the PKK, then Turkey has nothing to fear from Rojava,\"\u00a0Galbraith said. David Romano, a Middle East politics professor at Missouri State University in the US, added that \"it could be positive (for the Syrian Kurds) if the PKK disarms and they (SDF) do not, because they are not part of the PKK. \"Then that argument would be strengthened. I don't think the Syrian Kurds are in a position to disarm themselves, they need their weapons to protect their autonomy and their rights,\" Romano told MEE. The White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told Voice of America\u00a0that the White House hopes \"that it will help assuage our Turkish allies about US counter-ISIS partners in northeast Syria\". Local Kurdish media reports that attacks by Turkish-backed groups have so far not stopped, with shelling targeting\u00a0the countryside surrounding the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani. Syria's Luqman Ahmi, co-chair of the Democratic Green Party and former spokesperson of the Kurdish-led self-administration, told MEE that \"Turkish-backed groups continue to attack our regions to this day.\" \"While war has subsided in large parts of Syria, we hope these attacks will cease and that the country transitions toward a process of national reconciliation,\" said Ahmi. 'In our view, abandoning arms and entering civil and political processes is a positive development' - Jadaan Ali, KNC \"Together, we can build a diverse, democratic, and decentralised Syria - one capable of addressing cultural, political, and economic issues.\" Hoshang Hasan, a journalist based in Syria, pointed out that a successful peace process would also make it easier for the SDF to reach an agreement with the new administration in Damascus, which enjoys good ties with Turkey. \"If Turkey doesn't put pressure on Damascus, I think the agreement will be easier,\" he told MEE. So far, negotiations between the SDF and Damascus to find a solution for the Syrian Kurdish autonomy have not yielded results. Syria's new government\u00a0insists on integrating the SDF into the Syrian army and a central state, while the Syrian Kurds seek autonomy and decentralisation. \"We believe that reinstating a centralised administration in Syria will only yield the same results. This has been tried before and the consequences were not just failures but a humanitarian catastrophe that cost millions of lives,\" Ahmi said. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye.

        "title": "What's next after Ocalan's order to disband PKK? | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader, Abdullah Ocalan, issued an order on Thursday for the group he founded to disband and disarm. His announcement was largely welcomed by Turkish political leaders and the media. Ocalan, who has been imprisoned on Imrali Island in the Marmara Sea since 1999, had previously called for ceasefires, most notably between 2012 and 2015, but he had never before explicitly asked for the PKK to dissolve itself. Sources close to the negotiations between the Turkish government, Ocalan and the PKK say that the process leading up to this decision lasted more than a year. The initiative was first revealed in October by Devlet Bahceli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and a key ally of Turkey\u2019s ruling coalition. Despite Turkey's continued military operations against the PKK, Ankara allowed Ocalan to be photographed and permitted pro-Kurdish politicians to publicly read his statement, which was broadcast live on all major news channels. Turkey, the European Union and the United States classify the PKK as a terrorist organisation due to its attacks on civilians. Thousands of people have been killed by the war between the PKK and Turkey since the 1980s. Many analysts view Ocalan\u2019s call as a direct result of Turkey\u2019s military success in isolating the PKK in nothern Iraq's Qandil mountains, depriving it of territorial control and infiltration routes since 2016. Turkey has utilised advanced drone technology and electronic warfare capabilities to weaken the group. The only area where PKK-affiliated groups have somewhat freely maintained a presence is Syria, where the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) controls significant territory after expelling Islamic State fighters. Ocalan\u2019s statement not only called for the PKK\u2019s dissolution but also included a direct order to the group\u2019s leadership to convene a congress as soon as possible to finalise the necessary steps to dismantle it. Hande Firat, a columnist for Hurriyet newspaper with close ties to the Turkish government, wrote\u00a0on Friday that the next steps are already agreed upon. This includes the PKK\u2019s umbrella organisation, the KCK (Group of Communities in Kurdistan), organising a congress within two to three months. Meanwhile, Yildiray Ogur, a columnist for Karar newspaper and the first journalist to report on the negotiations, expects the congress to take place as early as March, rather than a longer timeframe. \"The state, in particular, demanded the dissolution decision - it was the state's request. And they are very pleased,\" Ogur told Middle East Eye. \"Ocalan\u2019s statement is very clear, leaving no room for escape.\" Ocalan took full responsibility for the decision, saying the PKK had outlived its purpose. While posing for cameras, Ocalan was joined by three other inmates - Omer Hayri Konar, Veysi Aktas, and Hamili Yildirim, all senior PKK commanders - suggesting that he was not alone in making this decision. Firat argues that once the PKK or KCK formally decides to disarm and dissolve, including its armed wings in Syria, Iraq, and Iran, Ankara will shift its focus to democratic reforms, potentially easing legal pressure on Kurdish politicians. Ogur suggests that Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned former leader of the pro-Kurdish HDP, could be released under existing European Court of Human Rights rulings as a first step.\n\nFirat outlines the next steps: \"Weapons return and registration will begin in cooperation with neighboring countries. Foreign fighters will be required to leave their host countries. Those choosing to enter politics will be integrated into their respective country\u2019s political system. Senior KCK leaders will be relocated to third countries.\"\n\nMany expect that PKK leaders may be relocated to Iraq's Suleymaniyah, a region controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a political party historically friendly to the armed group. Ogur recalls that during the 2013-2015 Turkey-PKK peace process, lists of PKK members were created, allowing those not involved in armed conflict to return to Turkey without facing charges, while senior commanders were relocated to third countries. One of the biggest uncertainties is how this decision will affect Syria. SDF Commander Mazlum Abdi said on Thursday that while his group welcomed Ocalan\u2019s decision, it does not apply to the Syrian Democratic Forces, revealing that he had received a personal letter from Ocalan. However, Ogur argues that Abdi\u2019s reaction is unsurprising since the SDF officially denies any links to the PKK. \"PKK is the name of the movement, and Abdi - like it or not - is part of that,\" he said. Ocalan\u2019s statement also undermines the SDF\u2019s push for autonomy, according to Ogur. \"The inevitable consequence of an excessive nationalist drift - separate nation states, federations, administrative autonomy, and culturalist solutions - fails to address the sociology of historical societies,\" Ocalan said in his address, effectively abandoning his previous stance demanding cultural autonomy. Firat adds that Turkey could continue military operations against the PKK and even escalate action against the SDF in Syria if the group refuses to integrate into the new Syrian government, which is close to Ankara. According to Ogur, Abdi had been in favour of reconciliation with Ahmed al-Sharaa's administration in Damascus, but the PKK leadership in Qandil prevented it. \"The PKK was insisting on waiting for Israel and the US,\" he added. \"Turkey is encouraging the SDF to become a political organisation through its political wing, the Democratic Union Party [PYD], and to participate in the Syrian constitutional process, enter elections, and pursue its struggle through political means.\" Ogur acknowledges that there are individuals within both Dem, a pro-Kurdish Turkish political party, and the PKK who view Ocalan\u2019s order to disband as a step too far. \"But it would be very difficult for the PKK leadership to ignore this order, since Ocalan also sent separate letters to the Qandil mountains, and everyone was kept in the loop,\" Ogur said, adding that Ocalan is regarded as a semi-divine figure within the organisation. Ankara has already engaged with Salih Muslim, the co-chairman of PYD between 2013-2015. One unpredictable factor is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Throughout this process, Erdogan has maintained a low profile, only making occasional remarks to show his support for the process. However, Ogur believes Erdogan could present this as a major political victory, portraying himself as the leader who definitively ended the PKK. \"The very existence of the PKK would be void and null, allowing many political prisoners to be freed since most are imprisoned on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation,\" Ogur said. \"I know that the government is already studying this option.\" Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye.

        "title": "Israeli army concludes Hamas defeated it on 7 October | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "An internal Israeli army investigation has concluded that Hamas tricked Israel for years and swiftly overran and defeated an entire Israeli military division on 7 October 2023. Released on Thursday, the probe found that the Israeli military\u00a0\"failed\" to protect Israeli civilians and was not prepared for the Hamas-led attack, during which around 1,200 people were killed and\u00a0251 taken as captives. The command-and-control of the so-called \"Gaza Division\" of Israel's Southern Command collapsed within hours of the attack, launched by the Palestinian movement's armed wing at 6.29am. Top Israeli officers, including the division\u2019s Southern Brigade commander Asaf Hamami and many company and platoon commanders, were killed by Hamas fighters by 7 AM. According to reports citing Israeli security sources, only 767 soldiers were stationed at the boundary with Gaza on the day. Around 5,000 Hamas fighters entered the area by land, air and sea in different waves of the attack. The first series of\u00a0investigations, conducted by the Southern Command, Operations Division, Israeli Air Force and Israeli Navy, found that the regional unit tasked with guarding the boundary of the Gaza Strip was overpowered in the first hours of the attack. Israel's military had missed obvious signs of the\u00a0impending attack and preparations around it, ignoring some reports and warnings from even the day before. Furthermore, because no immediate threat was assumed, the army had stuck to usual protocols on deployment,\u00a0with only drones dispatched for surveillance missions after intelligence\u00a0received overnight on 6 October. According to the reports, the Israeli military's\u00a0Gaza Division, which is stationed along the 59km barrier to Gaza, was defeated for around 10 hours. \u201cOctober 7 was a complete failure, the IDF (Israeli army) failed in fulfilling its mission to protect Israeli civilians,\u201d a senior Israeli army official told reporters following the publication of the probe. \u201cToo many civilians died that day asking themselves in their hearts or out loud, where was the IDF?\u201d Within the first six hours of the offensive, Hamas's Qassam Brigades gained operational control over Israeli communities nearby the besieged enclave, alongside Israeli military posts, and the main paths in the western Negev area. Its fighters were attacking numerous areas\u00a0simultaneously, which the investigations estimate at 114 locations,\u00a0as the Israeli army scrambled to regain control with minimal forces and capabilities. Less than 10 minutes after fighters led by the Qassam Brigades crossed into Israel, the Gaza Division declared Parash Peleshet (\"hostile intrusion\" in Hebrew), a code that refers to the highest degree of infiltration. The investigation found that the ground attack had three main influx of Hamas fighters, while the invasion via sea using seven speedboats and air using paragliders was carried out by just 38 and eight Palestinian fighters respectively. The Israeli military's internal investigations found too that\u00a0Israel's perception of Hamas\u00a0underestimated the Palestinian group's military capabilities, focusing instead on what was perceived to be the bigger threat coming from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. The Israeli army considered the attack as a form of \"deception\" by the Palestinian group, and a wide-scale attack was not seen as realistic or feasible. The inquiry into the events of that day has sparked reactions across the political spectrum in Israel. Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for \"whitewashing\" its own responsibility for the invasion. \"The army is demonstrating courage and values \u200b\u200band investigating itself without any attempt to whitewash or cover up its responsibility. It is time for the failed bunch of cowards called the 'Israeli government' to do the same. Instead of running away from responsibility all day, they should learn from the army and establish a state commission of inquiry,\" he said in a post on X. Meanwhile, the army's outgoing chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said he took \"responsibility\" for the attacks. \"I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,\" he said. In late April 2024, Haaretz released\u00a0a report, collecting dozens of testimonies, geolocated videos and built maps, investigating the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, showcasing the failure of Israeli security and assistance to civilians. According to the report, residents of Israeli communities near Gaza were left without rescue for hours, losing faith in their government. Some even appealed to the media for help. \"All of Israel's intelligence and operational systems collapsed,\" the report said. \"All of its political conceptions were proven false. In the space of 24 hours, Israelis lost faith that their state could protect them.\" Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.

        "title": "UK government beaten by five-year-old in Supreme Court citizenship case | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "A child was wrongly denied British nationality after her father successfully appealed against the UK government\u2019s efforts to remove his citizenship, the Supreme Court has ruled. The complex case involves the five-year-old daughter of a man who at the time of her birth in Bangladesh in 2019 was in the midst of a legal battle to regain his own British citizenship. The man, known as E3 due to anonymity conditions, is among a number of British nationals from Bangladeshi backgrounds whom the government attempted to strip of their citizenship in the past decade on national security grounds. They included some people who had travelled to\u00a0Syria during the country\u2019s civil war, although E3's case is not understood to be Syria-related. But an immigration appeals court in 2021 ruled that they had been left stateless because the UK government had wrongly assessed that they were entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship. The Home Office then restored E3\u2019s citizenship, but refused to recognise his daughter\u2019s birthright because it maintained that he was not a British national between the loss of his citizenship in 2017 and 2021. E3 and another man, known as N3, then launched judicial review proceedings, also brought in the name of the child, known as ZA, to determine what their citizenship status had been during that period. Their lawyers argued that because the withdrawal of their citizenship was unlawful, they had in fact remained British nationals throughout. In 2022, the High Court ruled in favour of the government, noting that ZA was \u201centirely blameless\u201d but had not been entitled to British citizenship at the time of her birth. That verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2023. But in an unanimous judgment on Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that E3 and N3 had remained British citizens, citing the UK\u2019s obligations under international law, which prohibit rendering a person stateless and \u201cthe fundamental right of citizenship\u201d. 'The entire process has left my family and I feeling like we are second-class citizen' - E3, British citizen \u201cThe consequence of this for ZA is that she is a British citizen by virtue of E3\u2019s status as a British citizen at the time of ZA\u2019s birth,\u201d the judgment said. Responding to the judgment through his lawyers, Duncan Lewis Solicitors, E3 described the outcome as \u201cbittersweet\u201d. \u201cI have lost out on the critical years of my daughter\u2019s childhood and am still unable to fathom how it took the intervention of the most senior judges in the country to determine what was a matter of simple common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire process has left my family and I feeling like we are second-class citizens.\u201d Fahad Ansari, who represented the man and his daughter, called on Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to apologise to the family. \u201cIt is astonishing that the government put up such a rigorous struggle over the fundamental rights of an \u2018entirely blameless\u2019 child who, at the tender age of five, has had to battle through the highest courts in England to be recognised as British,\u201d Ansari said. The British government used controversial citizenship-stripping powers against dozens of British nationals who travelled to Syria during the civil war, including a number who remain stranded in camps and prisons in northeast Syria for people suspected of links to the Islamic State (IS) group. International law prohibits a country from making people stateless but the UK government argued that those it targeted were dual nationals or entitled to another nationality. However, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission in 2021 ruled that British nationals with an entitlement to Bangladeshi citizenship would forfeit that right if they had not claimed it by the age of 21, as was the case for both E3 and N3, and therefore had no other claim to citizenship. Those circumstances do not apply for Shamima Begum, a London-born woman who travelled to IS-controlled territory aged 15 in 2015 and remains in a detention camp in northeast Syria. In her appeal against the loss of her citizenship, she was found to still have a right to Bangladeshi citizenship because she was deprived of her British citizenship before she was 21. In a statement, Duncan Lewis Solicitors said the case could have consequences for children born to people stripped of citizenship and left stateless who were now stranded in detention camps in Syria and Iraq, or in refugee camps in Turkey and Lebanon. \u201cThe British government has a duty of care to inform these children and their parents of the impact of this judgment and to take urgent steps to repatriate them,\u201d it said. The Home Office has been approached for comment. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.  Only England and Wales jurisdiction apply in all legal matters.

        "title": "Turkey and the PKK: Who is Abdullah Ocalan? | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "For decades, Abdullah Ocalan has been at the heart of the Kurdish question in Turkey and the wider Middle East. The founder of the Kurdistan Workers Party (Partiya Karkeren Kurdistane\u00a0or PKK) in southeastern Turkey in 1978, Ocalan has been incarcerated in Imrali island prison south of Istanbul since 1999. But even from prison, he remains a crucial political figure, issuing orders and pronouncements that can change the future of the region. To describe Ocalan as a controversial and polarising figure is an understatement. For millions of Kurds across the Middle East and the diaspora, he is responsible more than any other person for raising the profile of the Kurdish plight, fighting against governments, and building a range of media outlets, political organisations, community buildings, language schools, and festivals. His face is ubiquitous at rallies across not only Turkey but the Middle East, Europe, and other parts of the Kurdish diaspora. But for Turkey, he is the \"baby-killer\", as he was branded in the press, overseeing terror attacks and a violent insurgency during the 1980s and 1990s that led to tens of thousands of deaths and threatened the break-up of the country. In recent years, leftists in Europe and the Middle East have praised Ocalan for building arguably the largest left-wing movement in the region, with an ideology based on secularism, feminism, and decentralised democracy. But he also has critics, including amongst Kurdish activists. Some of these are former comrades who have called Ocalan out for his authoritarianism, personality cult, and abandoning the ultimate goal of an independent Kurdistan. This week Ocalan again changed the agenda and called for the PKK to end its insurgency against Turkey - which has lasted more than four decades - and dissolve itself. But what this will mean in practice, not just for the PKK but also political organisations and others who follow Ocalan and his ideology? \u201cOcalan\u2019s call sets the framework for what the PKK needs to do next \u2013 but whether the group takes the next step for a congress, well, that will depend on whether they think they are getting what they need,\u201d Aliza Marcus, author of Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence, told Middle East Eye. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what behind-the-scenes deals may have been worked out in advance, but we do know that the PKK\u2019s leadership in [Iraq] is very willing to put its own conditions and interpretations on Ocalan\u2019s statements.\u201d After the end of World War 1 and the reshaping of the boundaries of the Middle East, millions of Kurds were left scattered across Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The Treaty of Sevres in 1920 would have seen the victorious allies including the US, UK and France create a Kurdish state from the former territories of the Ottoman Empire. But it was ditched for the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 after the success of the Turkish War of Independence between 1919 and 1923. Kurds now faced repression in all the states and countries where they lived. Turkey, with its new nationalist government, arguably imposed the strictest regulations, banning Kurdish names, the Kurdish language, and refusing to acknowledge Kurds - mostly located in its south east as a minority. Kurdish rebellions against the republic in 1924 and 1937 were crushed. In 1956 a British diplomat travelling through the south east noted that he did not \"catch the faintest breath of Kurdish nationalism which the most casual observer in Iraq cannot fail to notice\". Villages, towns, and cities in Kurdish regions were marked with the famous slogan by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founding father: \"How happy is the one who says 'I am a Turk'.\" It was in this environment that Abdullah Ocalan was born in 1946 or 1947: the year is unclear as there was no official record of his birth in his remote home village of Omerli in the southeastern Sanliurfa province. Life then was hard for most Kurds in Turkey, with electricity and running water largely non-existent, and poverty ubiquitous. Unlike Kurdish political leaders in Iraq and Iran, or those who had come before in Turkey, Ocalan had no links to the land-owning class, religious institutions, or tribal leadership. He would later say he grew up in an environment of \"overwhelming unhappiness\" marked by back-breaking farm labour; and he recalls his sister being effectively \"sold\" to a man in another village for flour and money, an incident he said coloured his view on the need for women's emancipation in Kurdistan. \u201cI recall having a sense of regret,\u201d Ocalan said with regards to his sister.\u00a0\u201c[I was thinking that] if I were a revolutionary, then I would not let this happen. They would not be able to take her away.\u201d In the mid 1960s, Ocalan failed his entrance exams for military school - an ironic early ambition for a later Kurdish nationalist - and so travelled to Ankara in 1966 to study at a vocational school. The 1960s in Turkey had begun with hope but became increasingly politically polarised. In 1961, a new constitution was introduced, following a coup the previous year, and was hailed by many as introducing a new era of political liberalism. And while being an openly Kurdish activist in Turkey still carried risks, there was now much more debate about Kurdish rights than there had been for years. The new mood also coincided with growth in the Turkish socialist movement, which had also been oppressed, but was now more sympathetic to Kurdish aspirations. The rise of left-wing radicalism, combined with attempted Kurdish uprisings in neighbouring Iran and Iraq, inspired Ocalan and other Kurds, who before had little understanding of their background. Groups such as the Revolutionary Eastern Cultural Hearths were now formed, combining Kurdish nationalism and Marxism, albeit while using euphemisms to avoid state crackdowns (which nevertheless came anyway). But this period of liberalisation did not last: soon, violence between left-wing and far-right groups grew in intensity, becoming ubiquitous from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1971, another coup saw the closure of many of the emerging left-wing and pro-Kurdish organisations. That same year Ocalan, now 21, left his job as a clerk in Istanbul, where had moved in the early 1970s, and moved back to Ankara to study political science. By now increasingly involved in politics, he was arrested in 1972 while protesting against the killing of armed Turkish leftists who had kidnapped three Nato\u00a0technicians. Ocalan spent seven months in prison, reading extensively and discussing ideas with other jailed activists. \u201cFor me, prison was a school on advancing the political struggle,\" he would later say. It would also convince him, and many other Kurds, that there was little prospect for advancing Kurdish rights through peaceful means. On 25 November 1978, after two years of planning, a group of Kurds, including Ocalan, met in a tea house in the village of Fis in southeastern Turkey. It was there that they announced a new party: the PKK. The two dozen activists involved in its founding had several clear ideas. One was to focus on armed struggle, given that the decades taking a peaceful and democratic approach had only been met with arrests, extrajudicial killings, and increased state repression. A second principle was to change Kurdish society. The failures of similar Kurdish uprisings in Iraq and Iran were, in part, attributed to the conservatism and tribalist origins of parties like the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). In contrast, the PKK would, like other national liberation movements in Vietnam, Palestine, Africa, India, and elsewhere, adopt Marxism-Leninism to create a Kurdistan that was independent and socialist. A third focus would be on discipline. The new party would be professional, hierarchical, and focus on training and organising cadres ideologically and militarily to fight against one of the most powerful armies in Europe. The PKK cadres would learn much of this from fellow national liberation movements, such as the Palestinians. Cadres would be sent to the camps in Lebanon to be trained by fellow Marxist-Leninists such as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). At least 13 members of the PKK would later die fighting Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Ocalan, from 1978 until 1984, focused on consolidating his own power in the PKK as well as the group's power over the wider Kurdish movement. Members of other Kurdish political parties, as well as members of the PKK itself, accused Ocalan of imposing a deeply authoritarian culture within both the party and the movement, stifling debate and dissent and attacking rivals both verbally and physically. Splits and defections from the PKK were not tolerated and could often lead to violence or assassination. Former PKK members said around six or eight experienced PKK members were summarily killed between 1984 and 1985 because they were viewed \"as a possible threat or a burden\". According to Vahap Coskun, a law professor at Dicle University in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir, Ocalan developed a cult of personality within the organisation. \"Ocalan was positioned as an absolute leader within the PKK. His titles and qualities were made superhuman,\" he told MEE. \"When the PKK was mentioned, only Ocalan's name came to mind. No other name has any importance or value within the PKK.\" Supporters of the PKK saw discipline as a necessary evil to avoid the infighting and timidity that had sunk previous attempts at Kurdish independence. But critics said it left the party dominated by Ocalan and his often inflexible ideas. In 1979, the Turkish military staged a coup and launched a crackdown across the country, primarily targeting leftists and pro-Kurdish activists. The next four years of military rule would see a new constitution imposed that restricted Kurdish activism even more. Many members of the PKK found themselves in the notorious Diyarbakir prison where they faced severe torture. The military's actions proved for many Kurds once and for all that the Turkish state would never willingly grant concessions to them, or recognise their existence. In 1984, armed struggle was officially launched. The next 15 years would see southeastern Turkey plunged into a guerrilla war. The PKK targeted state assets, police, and military as well as civilians they alleged were collaborating with the Turkish state. In their first attack on 15 August 1984, PKK forces attacked the gendarmerie station in Eruh, Siirt, killing one soldier and injuring six others and three civilians. Simultaneously, they carried out another attack in Hakkari, which killed two police officers. Initially, the Turkish state did not take the attacks seriously - then just a few days later, a PKK attack killed three presidential guards belonging to President Kenan Evran, who also led the 1979 coup. The army soon launched a crackdown in areas of southeastern Turkey suspected of being sympathetic towards the PKK: whole Kurdish villages were depopulated and destroyed, mass arrests were carried out, prisoners and others were subjected to torture, and indiscriminate violence was meted out. The death toll over four decades has been put at more than 40,000 killed, the majority Kurds. Far-right and Islamist groups - often linked to organised crime - were secretly empowered by the state to kill suspected PKK supporters, journalists, and leftists. But, according to Coskun, the state's methods only saw PKK support grow amongst Kurds in Turkey. \"The PKK was perceived as an organisation that fought against the state that violated the fundamental rights of the Kurds and trampled on the dignity of the Kurds, and defended the Kurds against the state,\" he told MEE.\u00a0\"As the state's oppression increased in the 1990s, the PKK became even more massive.\" Ocalan had moved to Syria in 1979 and would remain there until 1998. Although Syria had its own Kurdish minority, President Hafez al-Assad was keen to pressure Ankara and so allowed the PKK to operate from its soil. Support for the PKK amongst Turkey's Kurds grew, along with awareness of Kurdish culture and history both in the country and in Europe. New outlets and institutions - some directly backed by the PKK, some with no link, some existing in a grey area, emerged internationally to highlight Kurdish rights. Turkish President Tughat Ozal - who claimed Kurdish heritage himself - made gestures towards Kurdish figures in neighbouring Iraq, overturning a long taboo on the subject. He also overturned the ban on the Kurdish language being spoken publicly. In March 1993, Ocalan, hoping that Ozal was sincere, announced a 25-day unilateral ceasefire. Using Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani as a go-between, he implied was willing to talk to Ozal. But a month later Ozal was dead from a heart attack: many suspected he had been poisoned.\u00a0 And the rest of the 1990s would see the bloodshed reach new heights. According to Amnesty International, thousands were \"disappeared\" by state-linked forces, and as many as two million people were displaced, while the PKK at times resorted to suicide bombings and extortion. Things came to a head in 1998. The presence of Ocalan in Syria and\u00a0ongoing PKK attacks eventually became too much for Ankara, which threatened to invade Syria if the Kurdish leader wasn't dealt with. Not willing to risk a conflict with the second-largest army in Nato, Assad expelled Ocalan. Ocalan fled across Europe where he sought asylum unsuccessfully. Eventually, in 1999, he was captured in Kenya\u00a0by the Turkish security services. Initially, Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason at a trial that was criticised by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. After Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 'The right of determination of the people includes the right to a state of their own. However, the foundation of a state does not increase the freedom of a people' - Abdullah Ocalan He has remained jailed in Imrali ever since. During his time in prison, Ocalan re-evaluated his political ideas. He abandoned his long-held commitment to Marxism-Leninism, and instead started espousing what he called 'Democratic Confederalism', inspired by the writings of American anarchist Murray Bookchin. He also published several works that captured his fresh vision of a future Middle East. Gone would be the primacy of the nation-state, instead replaced with a decentralised post-capitalist society that emphasised feminism, environmentalism and self-determination for ethnic and religious groups. \"The right of determination of the people includes the right to a state of their own. However, the foundation of a state does not increase the freedom of a people,\" he wrote in his book Democratic Confederalism. \"The system of the United Nations that is based on nation-states has remained inefficient [for] social development. Democratic Confederalism is the contrasting paradigm of the oppressed people.\" Ocalan's ideas were adopted throughout the PKK and its affiliated organisations, and welcomed by many left-wing groups, which saw them as politically inspiring in an age where many national liberation groups had become sclerotic or, in the Middle East, dominated by conservative Islamism. But Ocalan had abandoned the PKK's goal of an independent Kurdistan - and not everyone welcomed that. Huseyin Topgider was a founding member of the PKK, who left after Ocalan abandoned the goal of Kurdish independence. \u201cThe PKK doesn\u2019t know any more what it wants,\" he said. \"It says it wants freedom, everyone wants freedom. It says the Kurdish problem must be solved, but what does this mean now?\u201d Even while in prison, Ocalan continued to dominate Kurdish politics, and was crucial in an abortive peace process that would see the PKK disarm. In 2013, he organised a ceasefire with Turkey that was intended as the basis for talks to end the conflict. \"Let guns be silenced and politics dominate... a new door is being opened from the process of armed conflict to democratisation and democratic politics,\" he said in a statement read to crowds in Diyarbakir to mark Newroz, the Kurdish new year. \"It's not the end. It's the start of a new era.\" That era also saw the flourishing of Kurdish and pro-Kurdish political and media organisations. The Turkish state eased restrictions on teaching Kurdish in private schools and allowed the establishment of Kurdish broadcasters. 'It\u2019s not just up to Ocalan and has not been for years. He sets the framework, but because he is in prison...\u00a0the PKK itself defines its next moves' -\u00a0Aliza Marcus, specialist\u00a0on Kurds But the ceasefire collapsed in 2015 due to a range of reasons, not least the war in southern Syria, and war exploded again in southeastern Turkey. Armed gun battles broke out on the streets of regional cities. The Turkish army reduced swathes of the area to rubble. Thousands were killed. From then on, Ocalan's visitation rights in jail were heavily restricted. Kurdish activists across Turkey called for an end to his \"isolation\" with protests and even hunger strikes demanding he be allowed access to family and lawyers. But then, in October 2024, something unexpected happened. Devlet Bahceli, leader of the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), suggested that Ocalan could be paroled if he renounced \"terrorism\" and dissolved the PKK. The move was greeted with surprise: the MHP were for years the most implacable opponents of the PKK and any hint of Kurdish autonomy. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an ally of Bahceli, supported his comments and said he hoped \"this unique window of opportunity that the ruling coalition is offering to end the terror will not be sacrificed to personal agendas\". The reasons for the move have been debated. Some analysts\u00a0suggest that Erdogan lacks the parliamentary numbers to pass constitutional changes that could extend his term of office. If, the theory goes, he\u00a0 releases Ocalan and promises concessions on Kurdish rights, then the pro-Kurdish\u00a0Peoples\u2019 Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party may back him. Despite this, mass arrests of leftist and Kurdish activists and politicians has continued in recent weeks and months. Regardless, the move by Bahceli once again highlighted the centrality of Ocalan to the Kurdish movement - and no other Kurdish political figure can claim anywhere near the influence he has had and will doubtless continue to have. Marcus said Ocalan\u2019s imprisonment had altered the dynamics of his relationship with the PKK as an organisation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just up to Ocalan and has not been for years. He sets the framework, but because he is in prison and has not been able to have regular contact, the PKK itself defines its next moves,\u201d she told MEE. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this in the past, including during the 2013-2015 peace process, when Ocalan called on the rebels to withdraw from Turkey. The PKK started and then stopped the withdrawal, saying that Turkey hadn't responded positively to its initial moves.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Group of 7 October 2023 survivors file lawsuit against Al Jazeera: Report | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "A group of 7 October 2023 survivors\u00a0are suing the Al Jazeera network, which is based in Qatar, in a US court, alleging that it assisted Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in spreading propaganda, recruiting activists, and inciting violence. According to an article in The Jewish Chronicle\u00a0on Thursday, the survivors include Morris Schnaider, who is the maternal uncle of Shiri Bibas who was taken captive by Hamas. Schaider\u2019s sister and brother-in-law were also allegedly murdered in the attacks. The lawsuit was filed at a US District Court in Washington, DC, on 23 February, according to StandWithUS, which says they assisted in preparing the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks \"financial compensation and justice for victims and victims\u2019 families of the October 7th attacks and ensuing war\". The Chronicle says that the claim also alleges that Al Jazeera employed several Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members as journalists. The survivors are being represented by\u00a0Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who founded the Israel Law Center in 2003. The website declares the law centre is \u201cat the forefront of fighting terrorism and safeguarding Jewish rights worldwide\". The law centre has previously tried to sue Qatari banks and charities, accusing them of funding Hamas. It has also supported victims of the 7 October 2023 attacks by calling for an investigation into the political advocacy group, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Al Jazeera has been a thorn in Israel\u2019s side for several years, with the country\u2019s government and military consistently targeting Al Jazeera journalists and their network operations. Since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza in October 2023, the network has faced repeated attempts to shut down its reporting through arrests, imprisonment, and the killing of its journalists and their family members. In January, the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Authority suspended the broadcasting of Al Jazeera TV after accusing the news service of publishing \"inciting material\", according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A ministerial committee made up of the communications, culture and interior ministries published a statement regarding the announcement, accusing Al Jazeera of violating the \"laws and regulations in force in Palestine\", and saying it \"decided to temporarily stop the broadcast and freeze all the work of its journalists, employees, crews and channels affiliated with it\". \"This decision came after Al Jazeera insisted on broadcasting inciteful materials and reports characterised by being misleading, inciting sedition, and interference in Palestinian internal affairs,\" the statement reads. In May 2024, Israel also implemented a ban on Al Jazeera's website in the country after raiding its office in East Jerusalem and confiscating its equipment. In September, Israeli forces raided Al Jazeera's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah and ordered it to shut down operations. Neither Al Jazeera nor the Israel Law Center had responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.

        "title": "New York governor orders removal of Palestinian studies positions at Hunter College | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "Hunter College was ordered to remove two job postings for Palestinian studies positions by the Democratic governor of New York in the latest targeting of academic freedom in the state. Hunter College - which makes up one of City University of New York's (Cuny) 25 campuses - advertised it was seeking both humanities and social sciences faculty to take \u201ca critical lens to issues pertaining to Palestine including but not limited to: settler colonialism, genocide, human rights, apartheid, migration, climate and infrastructure devastation, health, race, gender and sexuality\u201d. The roles were announced Monday afternoon after they were posted on Cuny\u2019s website, but the posts were removed by mid-week. In a Bluesky post announcing the roles, sociology professor Heba Gowayed said on Monday, \u201cI am so pleased to announce a Palestinian Studies cluster hire. This is an incredible source of pride for me as a faculty member and one of the many reasons that I feel so lucky to work here.\u201d She also said she felt like \u201cthe luckiest person in academia\u2026Proud of Hunter administration for being a voice for justice in the face of so much horror.\u201d By the next day, on Tuesday, Governor Kathy Hochul had taken action to order the postings be removed \u201cto ensure that antisemitic theories are not promoted in the classroom\u201d, according to a statement that\u00a0The New York Post said her office had issued. The very same day, Cuny chancellor Felix Rodr\u00edguez and board of trustees chairperson William C Thompson Jr capitulated and announced they agreed with Hochul\u2019s decision to remove the postings, and the university would continue to \u201ctackle antisemitism\u201d. In a joint statement, they said: \u201cWe find this language divisive, polarizing and inappropriate and strongly agree with Governor Hochul\u2019s direction to remove this posting, which we have ensured Hunter College has since done. CUNY will continue working with the Governor and other stakeholders to tackle antisemitism on our campuses and combat hate in all of its forms.\u201d By Wednesday, the postings had been taken down. The same day, Gowayed said she was \u201cfeeling grief at the dehumanization inherent to all this\u201d. The Professional Staff Congress, a labour union representing 30,000 faculty and staff at Cuny, hit back at the removal of the postings, calling it \u201ca violation of academic freedom\u201d at Hunter College, in a letter to Hochul and Rodriguez. \u201cWe oppose antisemitism and all forms of hate, but this move is counterproductive. It is an overreach of authority to rule an entire area of academic study out of bounds,\u201d the letter said. A protest will be held at City College at 2:45pm on Thursday local time to oppose Hochul\u2019s order to remove the job postings. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye.

        "title": "'My intestines were outside my body': Israel's deliberate targeting of Lebanese healthcare workers | Middle East Eye",
        "text": "Whenever an air strike targeted the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh,\u00a0Hussein Jaber's response was always the same. Wearing just a thin flak jacket over his T-shirt and trousers, the 30-year-old rescue worker would jump into the back of a war-battered ambulance and speed off towards the danger - despite everyone else fleeing in the opposite direction. For over 14 months, this was his daily routine. He would spend day after day racing towards bombed-out buildings to\u00a0try and save those who had survived, and recover the bodies of those who did not. The work was dangerous. He and his team faced constant threats: from\u00a0unexploded ordnances to the floor beneath them giving way after multiple Israeli aerial attacks. But amongst the most significant threats they faced was one that would claim the lives of more than 200 other Lebanese healthcare workers. In Under Fire: Israel's War on Medics, a new documentary filmed before Israel and Hezbollah agreed to abide by a US-brokered ceasefire, several Lebanese paramedics, rescue workers, government officials and independent experts told Middle East Eye that they believe the disproportionately high death toll among Lebanese healthcare professionals was due to\u00a0their specific and deliberate targeting by the Israeli military. According to the United Nations and the Lebanese health ministry, aid and health workers accounted for at least 222 of the more than 4,000 people killed in Israel's war on Lebanon. 'There was no justification for bombing civil defence units or ambulances. We were in an open area - clearly visible' -\u00a0Mohammed Amasha, former rescue worker Under international law, the targeting of any first responder or health worker not partaking in armed conflict is illegal, even if they're funded or run by fighting groups like Hezbollah. Jaber recalled one such incident to MEE, saying that during Israel's relentless aerial campaign on the southern city of Nabatieh, several of his colleagues were injured - and one of them killed - when Israeli forces terrorised the area with so-called \"double-tap\" strikes. A double-tap strike involves hitting a target, waiting a few minutes for the first responders to arrive, and then hitting the same spot again. \"It was 16 October and Nabatieh was hit by a series of heavy air strikes.\u00a0The martyr [Najih Fahas] was checking the water supply [of a fire truck close to our civil defence offices]. Suddenly, we heard a loud bang and thick\u00a0black smoke filled the air. We couldn't breathe,\" he said. \"We heard his (Najih's) voice from a distance and rushed to him immediately. He was bleeding heavily. \"We started making our way to the hospital, but on the way, we were hit by another strike right next to us. The ambulance, it was a surreal sight, was thrown into the air and then crashed back down,\" he said. \"It was struck by a barrage of shrapnel and debris,\" he added. Nabatieh was among one of the hardest-hit areas in southern Lebanon and a frequent target of Israeli bombardment before a ceasefire went into effect on 26 November. Many of its apartment buildings, shops, and schools were destroyed and more than three months on, several of its neighbourhoods still remain cut off from basic services such as water and electricity. Mohammed Amasha, a former rescue worker who was forced to retire and relocate to the capital Beirut after sustaining life-altering injuries in an Israeli air strike, struggled to hold back tears when recalling the day that four of his colleagues were killed. \"I remember my intestines were outside my body,\" he said. \"There was no justification for bombing civil defence units or ambulances. We were in an open area - clearly visible - with the fire brigade and everything in plain sight. I don't know why this happened.\" Israel has never denied targeting emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire brigades, but has instead repeatedly accused Hezbollah of transporting and hiding fighters and weapons inside such vehicles, a tactic the movement vehemently denies. In October, the Israeli military's spokesman for Arabic media, Avichay Adraee, posted an animated video on X showing an armed Hezbollah fighter inside an ambulance full of weapons, with a message urging civilians not to use certain emergency services. He also warned medical teams against cooperating with Hezbollah and declared that \"necessary measures will be taken against any vehicle transporting gunmen, regardless of its type\". Speaking to MEE, Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, rubbished Israel's claim that it never\u00a0targets civilians or civilian infrastructure, saying: \"When Israel boasts about its intelligence, that it really knows what's happening, not only in streets, but even in apartments, it's very difficult not to see in this a targeted attack.\" A growing body of international legal experts and jurists have alleged that Israel committed war crimes in both Lebanon and Gaza through its repeated attacks on medical personnel. 'Israel believes that you can only ethnically cleanse an area if you destroy the healthcare system - which is a critical component of life' -\u00a0Ghassan Abu-Sittah,\u00a0British-Palestinian doctor In 2006, during Israel's last major war against Hezbollah, several international organisations concluded that Israel targeted ambulances clearly marked with Red Cross or Red Crescent symbols. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic surgeon who worked in Gaza over the last year and is now in Beirut, said the attacks on medical workers were reminiscent of Israeli tactics in Gaza. \"It's obvious that the destruction of the healthcare system is now a central tenet of Israeli military doctrine,\" he said. \"Israel believes that you can only ethnically cleanse an area if you destroy the healthcare system - which is a critical component of life.\" On Wednesday, the Israeli rights group, Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), accused Israel of systematically targeting Palestinian healthcare workers\u00a0in Gaza, arbitrarily detaining them without charge and submitting them to torture and abuse. Healthcare workers told PHRI they had experienced sexual abuse, beatings, dog attacks, starvation, sensory overload and also had boiling water poured over them. Israel is currently locked in trial proceedings at the UN's highest court on genocide charges, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant have both been issued arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Israeli military has not openly investigated any of the targeted strikes against emergency workers or medics in either Lebanon or Gaza. MEE reached out to the Israeli military and foreign office for comment but received no response by the time of publication. Copyright \u00a9 2014 - 2025.\u00a0Middle East Eye. All rights reserved.

Friedrich Merz, a candidate for Chancellor of Germany from the CDU/CSU bloc and a likely future head of government, has stated that he sees no justification for Germany to develop its own nuclear weapons. \"In my opinion, there are no grounds for that today,\" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung when asked if Germany should at least consider acquiring nuclear weapons in the future. \"Currently, we have what is known as a nuclear exchange with the Americans. Whether we can pursue a similar arrangement with France or Britain is a question I want to address in coalition talks and with our partners in Europe, the EU, and NATO,\" Merz emphasized. He also noted that he had not yet discussed this matter with French President Emmanuel Macron during his recent visit to Paris, particularly regarding whether Germany should rely not only on the U.S. but also on support from Paris and London for nuclear deterrence. According to Merz, the French proposal to explore a common nuclear umbrella for Europe is not a new idea. \"Now the situation has changed again, and therefore we should reconsider this issue together,\" he stated. At the same time, the CDU leader pointed out that \"articles 4 and 5 of the NATO Treaty concerning consultation and assistance remain unchanged, meaning that Germany\u2019s nuclear cooperation with the Americans continues as before.\" \"But here too, let us hope for the best while being prepared for the worst,\" Merz concluded.",

The key points of the communique which the EU plans to adopt at an emergency summit on March 6 which will focus on European security guarantees for Ukraine have been published by the Obshchestvennoye.Novosti media outlet. According to it, the communique will say that negotiations on Ukraine are impossible without Ukraine and negotiations on European security are impossible without the participation of Europe. The document will also say that any comprehensive peace agreement must be accompanied by reliable security guarantees for Kiev. According to the publication, the EU is in the process of selecting a representative to represent the alliance at the negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement. Earlier, EU Council President Antonio Costa scheduled an emergency EU summit for March 6 to discuss assistance to Ukraine and European defense. He also said that talks between French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump, would be discussed at this meeting. On February 12, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the prospects for resolving the conflict in Ukraine by phone. According to the Kremlin, Trump called for an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful solution to the problem. Putin emphasized the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with the US leader that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations. Later, Putin noted that the European Union states could participate in the negotiations, but they cannot force their way into this process. He said that Moscow had been in constant discussions with European countries, but they chose to disengage.",

        "text": "H\u00c0 N\u1ed8I \u2014 The State President\u2019s order on the promulgation of three laws, recently passed by the 15th National Assembly (NA) during its 9th extraordinary session, was announced at a press conference in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i on Friday morning. They are the law amending and supplementing several articles of the Law on the Organisation of the NA, the Law on Organisation of the Government, and the Law on Organisation of Local Governments. The first one took effect immediately upon its passage by the NA on February 17, revising 21 articles and repealing 17 others. The new law amends and adds regulations on the division of authority between the NA, the Government, and other state institutions, in a bid to clarify content on the modernisation of legislative processes and clearly define the principles and scope of legislative authority. It also provides updates on the roles of the NA Secretary-General, Office, and Standing Committee\u2019s agencies, while refining regulations governing the activities of the NA, its Standing Committee and deputies. The Law on Organisation of the Government, which consists of five chapters and 32 articles, will take effect on March 1. It defines the responsibilities and authority of the Prime Minister as the head of government, leading and overseeing the operations of the state administrative system from the central to local levels. It also outlines the duties of ministers and heads of ministerial-level agencies, both as leaders of their respective ministries and as members of the Government. Additionally, the law clarifies the relationship between the Government, the PM, ministers, and local administrations via principles for the division of authority, decentralisation, and delegation of power following the guiding principle of \"localities decide, implement, and take responsibility.\" The Law on Organisation of Local Governments, which comprises seven chapters and 50 articles, will also take effect on the first day of March. A key feature of this law is a dedicated chapter on the division of authority, decentralisation, and delegation of power between different levels of local governments. It introduces seven guiding principles to prevent overlapping responsibilities and to ensure that each level of local government has clearly defined powers and accountability, among others. To encourage local proactiveness and creativity, the law includes a new provision allowing local governments to propose adjustments in the delegation of power and responsibilities to agencies, organisations, and individuals, based on local capacities and real conditions. \u2014 VNS Copyrights 2012 Viet Nam News.

Some 600 guests attended the event, including leaders from various Russian government agencies and regions, representatives from foreign diplomatic missions in Russia, social organisations and businesses from both countries, friends, public figures, and Russian veterans with significant contributions to bilateral relations, as well as representatives from the Vietnamese community in Russia. Vietnamese Ambassador \u0110\u1eb7ng Minh Kh\u00f4i laid stress on the pride in the trustworthy friendship between the two countries over the past 75 years, stating the relations were built on the solid foundation of comradeship, wholehearted and selfless sharing, goodwill between the people of both countries, and effective cooperation for development. Kh\u00f4i highlighted that following the establishment of bilateral ties, the two sides fought side by side not only for Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s independence and unification but also for a more just global order. The ambassador underscored that Vi\u1ec7t Nam always bears in mind with profound gratitude the sincere and valuable support that Russia has provided for the country during tough times in the past and its current development phase. According to Kh\u00f4i, political relations between the two countries have been increasingly strengthened, with the regular exchange of high-level delegations, creating new powerful momentum for developing bilateral ties. Meanwhile, Special Representative of Russian President on International Cultural Cooperation Mikhail Shvydkoi stated that for many generations of Russians, the love for Vi\u1ec7t Nam comes naturally. After viewing the Vietnam News Agency photographs prominently displayed at the ceremony, he pointed out that the VNA's photographic documentation had taken all guests to wonderful milestones and deeply moving events in history, from when Vi\u1ec7t Nam's first President \u2013 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh visited Russia in the 1920s to President Putin's visit to Vi\u1ec7t Nam in 2024. Shvydkoi held that over more than three-quarters of a century, the fraternal relations between Vi\u1ec7t Nam and Russia have traveled a long and difficult path. However, the affection they hold for each other remains unchanged. According to him, on the international stage, Vi\u1ec7t Nam is one of Russia's closest partners in ASEAN in promoting Russia-ASEAN cooperation. In particular, strengthening the comprehensive strategic partnership between Vi\u1ec7t Nam and Russia always serves the interests of both people and contributes to ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. \u2014 VNS Copyrights 2012 Viet Nam News.

He also expressed his admiration for Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s past struggle for national liberation and reunification, and recalled his good impressions when he visited Vi\u1ec7t Nam and attended the 132nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU-132) in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i in 2015. The President called on the Ambassador to strengthen bilateral ties and promote economic, trade, and investment cooperation. He suggested C\u01b0\u1eddng introduce Botswana\u2019s key sectors, such as mining and beeves farming, to Vietnamese businesses interested in exploring opportunities in Botswana. C\u01b0\u1eddng conveyed warm greetings from State President L\u01b0\u01a1ng C\u01b0\u1eddng and other leaders of Vi\u1ec7t Nam.

D\u0169ng said Vi\u1ec7t Nam attaches importance to the CD, considering it the only multilateral forum with the top significant role in global disarmament. He highlighted Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s active engagement and contributions to the CD and related disarmament agreements, noting that Vi\u1ec7t Nam has assumed the CD chairmanship three times and is a signatory to all the most important multilateral treaties on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including many agreements that are the result of negotiations approved by the CD, most recently the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). Addressing the common concerns shared by member states regarding the current state of global security and the challenges facing the CD, D\u0169ng believed that more than ever, the CD needs to capitalise on the recent progress, such as the decision to establish working groups to discuss substantive issues. Vi\u1ec7t Nam calls on member states to uphold a sense of responsibility and political determination, enhance cooperation, engage in substantive and flexible dialogue, and promote inclusivity within the CD, he said, adding that by doing so, the CD can overcome its prolonged impasse and advance its multilateral disarmament agenda. As a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Vi\u1ec7t Nam supports regional disarmament efforts and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones worldwide, he said. The ambassador added that in this spirit, Vi\u1ec7t Nam underscores the importance of fully and effectively enforcing the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) and stays ready to work closely with nuclear-armed states to expedite their signing and accession to the treaty. \u2014 VNA/VNS Ambassador Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u00e0, Deputy Permanent Representative of Vi\u1ec7t Nam to the United Nations (UN), re-affirmed Vietnam's consistent stance\u00a0on\u00a0supporting all efforts\u00a0towards\u00a0nuclear disarmament\u00a0and\u00a0non-proliferation at the annual meeting of the UN Disarmament\u00a0Commission (UNDC) opened in New York on April 5.

The proposed policies target double-digit economic growth for the 2026\u201330 period; continued review, adjustment and streamlining of the functions and responsibilities of agencies, units, and organisations; and address aspects related to national defence-security, external affairs, State building and legal regulations on the fight against corruption, wastefulness and negative phenomena. In his speech, General Secretary T\u00f4 L\u00e2m underscored the importance of taking a fresh and in-depth look at the achievements, causes and lessons learned from 40 years of \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi under the 13th National Party Congress tenure. The outcomes of restructuring and streamlining the political system must clearly reflect the country's remarkable socio-economic strides in the final years of the current term, he said, urging a frank and objective evaluation of existing challenges and major obstacles across various sectors. Furthermore, he called for continuous updates and strategic analysis of the international landscape, identifying emerging global trends and their potential impacts on Vi\u1ec7t Nam, both in the short and long terms, to shape appropriate policymaking. Placing Party building at the forefront, the leader asserted that the 14th National Party Congress's documents must reaffirm the Party\u2019s steadfast theoretical adherence to the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi policy, while acknowledging the Party\u2019s historic responsibility to lead Vi\u1ec7t Nam into a new era filled with both opportunities and challenges. With time running short, the Party chief urged the standing members of the subcommittees to direct the editorial teams to adjust and finalise these documents to the highest standards and meet the set timeline. \u2014 VNA/VNS Copyrights 2012 Viet Nam News.

The New Zealand leader was in Vi\u1ec7t Nam for an official visit and to attend the second ASEAN Future Forum. The two countries upgraded their ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership on Wednesday, on the occasion of their 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. NA Chairman M\u1eabn expressed confidence that this upgrade will open up a new phase for more profound, trusting and strategic cooperation. Appreciating the discussions between the New Zealand PM and Vietnamese high-ranking leaders, the top legislator believed that the two countries will continue their close coordination to realise the agreements made and the goals of their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the near future. The two leaders also agreed to further increase exchanges between high-level delegations, including the committees and friendship parliamentary groups. They also shared the same views on expanding cooperation to new areas such as climate change response, just energy transition, green economy and climate-smart agriculture. Praising Vi\u1ec7t Nam\u2019s achievements in economic growth and social equity, PM Luxon said that New Zealand will continue to support the Southeast Asian nation in enhancing the quality of agricultural products with high export value as well as climate change adaptation. New Zealand will also continue its educational support for Vi\u1ec7t Nam, notably in terms of English training for public officials, and encouraging major New Zealand universities to strengthen ties with their counterparts in Vi\u1ec7t Nam, to help Vi\u1ec7t Nam develop high-quality human resources. Both leaders agreed to continue mutual support and coordination at regional and international forums. The New Zealand PM underscored strong support for ASEAN\u2019s central role and hoped to soon establish a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the association and his nation. On this occasion, NA Chairman M\u1eabn sent his greetings and an invitation to Gerry Brownlee, Speaker of New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives, for an official visit.

        "text": "H\u00c0 N\u1ed8I \u2014 The Vietnamese foreign ministry said on Thursday that China's live-fire drills in the Gulf of Tonkin this week were carried out within Chinese waters. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ph\u1ea1m Thu H\u1eb1ng made the statement in response for media's question regarding live ammunition military exercise in the Gulf of Tonkin from February 24 to 27 by the Chinese military and ships are warned not to enter this zone, just three days after Vi\u1ec7t Nam announced the baseline used to calculate the width of Vi\u1ec7t Nam's territorial sea in the Gulf of Tonkin on February 21. \"The area in which the drill takes place is stipulated in China's maritime announcement 13/2025 and lies entirely within China's domain,\" she said at the regular press conference in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. The establishment of the baseline in the Gulf of Tonkin aims to uphold Vi\u1ec7t Nam's rights and obligations under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and aligns with Vi\u1ec7t Nam's 2012 Law of the Sea, according to a press release by the foreign ministry. The baseline has been determined based on UNCLOS regulations, reflecting the geographical and natural characteristics of the Gulf of Tonkin while ensuring compliance with international treaties to which Vi\u1ec7t Nam is a party or member. The baseline serves as a legal foundation for defining Vi\u1ec7t Nam's maritime boundaries and the extent of its maritime zones in accordance with UNCLOS, along with the 2000 delimitation of the territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and continental shelves of the two countries in Beibu Gulf/Gulf of Tonkin between Vi\u1ec7t Nam and China, the ministry noted. It will also provide a robust legal basis for safeguarding and exercising Vi\u1ec7t Nam's sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, contributing to economic development, maritime management, and enhancing international cooperation. Scam centres Also during the press conference, the media also asked for the foreign ministry's comment on the information that Thai security forces rescued approximately 7,000 foreign nationals, including a number of Vietnamese citizens, from telephone scam centres near the Myanmar border, and they are awaiting repatriation. H\u1eb1ng said Vi\u1ec7t Nam is closely coordinating with relevant parties to verify specific information: \u201cWe are working with the Ministry of Public Security to handle this case while also directing Vi\u1ec7t Nam's representative offices in Thailand and Myanmar to promptly coordinate with local authorities to verify the identities of Vietnamese citizens and take timely measures for consular protection and assistance when necessary.\u201d Regarding cooperation with regional countries to dismantle scam operations along the border, spokesperson H\u1eb1ng stated that Vietnamese authorities have closely collaborated with other nations to investigate, clarify, and strictly handle violations committed by Vietnamese citizens abroad, in accordance with both Vietnamese law and the laws of the host countries. \u201cWe believe that all legal violations must be dealt with in line with the law. Vietnamese authorities have been, are, and will continue to closely monitor the situation, ensuring necessary and timely consular protection measures for Vietnamese citizens who are victims in such cases,\u201d spokesperson Ph\u1ea1m Thu H\u1eb1ng said. \u2014 VNS Copyrights 2012 Viet Nam News.

He added that South Africa has resolved to use diplomatic processes to deal with issues that \u201cmay have appeared in our relationship.\u201d The president\u2019s comments come as South Africa seeks to mend its fast-deteriorating relationship with the US \u2014 a relationship that soured after US President Donald Trump criticised South Africa about its recently signed Expropriation Act. US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio snubbed the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Johannesburg this week. Despite this, Ramaphosa said South Africa remained committed to diplomatic conflict resolution, citing the country\u2019s history of successful negotiations. He welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, describing it as a critical step towards alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel and Hamas agreed on a deal that will halt the war in Gaza and see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. \u201cThis ceasefire must lay the basis for a just and lasting peace in line with UN resolutions, international law and internationally agreed parameters. As the G20, we must continue to advocate for diplomatic solutions,\u201d he said. He added that the ceasefire must lay the basis for a just and lasting peace in line with UN resolutions, international law and internationally agreed parameters. \u201cAs the G20, we must continue to advocate for diplomatic solutions. Our own experience as South Africa is that the peaceful resolution of conflict through inclusive dialogue is the foremost guarantor of sustainable, lasting peace.\u201d In his opening address, Ramaphosa at the start of the G20 meeting of foreign ministers at Nasrec, Johannesburg, on Thursday, Ramaphosa called for calm during the heightened rising intolerance, conflict, climate change as well as energy and food insecurity across the world. He added that it was important to prioritise coordinated responses to meet these problems. \u201cThe nations of the world look to the G20 for leadership on the most pressing issues confronting our world. Just as cooperation supported the progress of early humans, our modern-day challenges can only be resolved through collaboration, partnership and solidarity,\u201d he said. He called on global leaders to unite and adapt to changing times as they look for solutions to geopolitical tensions. Ramaphosa urged leaders to focus on inclusivity in global decision-making, adding that the G20, which represents two-thirds of the global population, must work towards consensus in responding to these crises. \u201cThat is why South Africa has placed solidarity, equality and sustainability at the centre of our G20 presidency. We would like our G20 presidency to be one in which all voices are heard and in which all views count,\u201d he said. Outlining priorities for South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency, Ramaphosa placed strong emphasis on climate change, debt sustainability, just energy transition financing and the responsible use of critical minerals for inclusive economic growth. He highlighted the urgent need to enhance disaster resilience and response efforts, particularly in developing nations disproportionately affected by climate change. Ramaphosa also raised concerns over the rising cost of borrowing in emerging economies, which has significantly curtailed domestic development. \u201cMore than 3.3 billion people live in countries where interest payments on debt exceed education or health spending. The G20 needs to renew its efforts to advance debt sustainability, with a particular emphasis on African countries,\u201d he said. On climate change, Ramaphosa said major polluting nations must be at the forefront to support those least responsible for global warming. He called on the\u00a0 G20 leaders to reach an agreement on increasing both the quality and quantity of climate finance directed towards developing economies. \u201cThis includes strengthening multilateral development banks, enhancing and streamlining support for country platforms such as the Just Energy Transition Partnership, and leveraging private capital more effectively,\u201d he said, adding that global pollutants had caused the Earth to heat above the 1.5\u00b0C limit set by the 2016 Paris Agreement. Ramaphosa said there was a need for green industrialisation and investment in critical minerals beneficiation to ensure sustainable economic growth. \u201cSouth Africa will seek to take forward the recommendations of the 2024 report of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals,\u201d he said.

        "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy finally reached a deal, or at least the \u201cframework\u201d of a deal, on developing Ukraine\u2019s critical mineral reserves. While the details need to be finalized by later agreements, Zelenskyy and Trump agreed to an arrangement whereby the U.S. and Ukraine would jointly manage a fund financed by revenues from Ukraine\u2019s minerals as well as its hydrocarbons, with the proceeds expected to be reinvested in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nTrump was clearly interested in securing this deal, largely as a way for the U.S. to, in his words, \u201crecoup\u201d the costs of the military aid it has supplied to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s all-out invasion of the country three years ago this week. But it was Zelenskyy who initially floated a mineral deal as part of the \u201cVictory Plan\u201d proposal he put forward in October. Overall, the agreement appears to be, in the words of Kyiv School of Economics President Tymofiy Mylovanov, \u201cA victory for Zelensky, but also a victory for Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps most notable about the agreement is that it came after Trump seemed to pivot U.S. support from Ukraine to Russia on questions about the war. On Monday, the U.S. voted against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian invasion and calling for Moscow to return the Ukrainian territory it currently occupies. That followed two weeks in which the Trump administration had made clear that it was looking to revise, retrench or even, some fear, revoke U.S. security guarantees to Europe. And all of that was on top of a slew of public insults and criticisms leveled by Trump toward Zelenskyy, who responded in kind.

        "text": "\u201cWe must chart [a new] path in a world that is rapidly changing,\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa told the South African people this month in his State of the Nation address. Without mentioning U.S. President Donald Trump or Elon Musk directly, Ramaphosa gave a forceful denunciation of the remarkable swing in U.S. policy toward South Africa since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20. Describing the world South Africa must now navigate as characterized by rising nationalism and protectionism, Ramaphosa declared that Pretoria \u201cwill not be bullied.\u201d\n\n\n\nRamaphosa\u2019s address came in response to a whiplash-inducing turn from the era of Trump\u2019s predecessor, former President Joe Biden, which has seen the machinery of the U.S. government deployed to advance a misinformation agenda linked to South African white nationalist movements against Pretoria. As part of that turn, last week the U.S. Embassy pledged immediate action on a petition from right-wing white Afrikaners, to whom Trump has promised refugee status.\n\n\n\nDespite the new overtones, however, this sudden pivot comes against the backdrop of more long-standing tensions in the U.S.-South Africa relationship over multilateralism, human rights and the role of rising powers in the global order. Given South Africa\u2019s rotating presidency of the G20 and its membership in the BRICS grouping, Pretoria finds itself in the crosshairs of this toxic politics, which is already having diplomatic reverberations. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 gathering hosted by South Africa, a move best understood as a simultaneous rebuke of the post-apartheid South African government, the International Court of Justice and the BRICS.

        "title": "U.S. Refugee Admissions Were Flagging Long Before Trump | WPR",
        "text": "Among the dozens of executive orders signed by U.S. President Donald Trump since taking office, one action received relatively little media attention: his decision to suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, or USRAP. A judge in Seattle temporarily blocked that executive order earlier this week, saying that it overstepped the president\u2019s authority with regard to a congressionally mandated program. But even if resettlement resumes, admissions numbers are likely to be quite low.\n\n\n\nThe effort to shutter USRAP was not entirely unexpected, as Trump slashed refugee admissions to historical lows during his first term, causing many resettlement agencies to close offices and lay off staff. This time around, however, it has become clear that what was once a program enjoying broad bipartisan support is now subject to the same rancorous divide on display with regard to all aspects of immigration policy. Other than a handful of human rights and humanitarian advocacy groups, few voices in Washington defend refugees. While Trump will shoulder the blame if USRAP ends up being cut, changes to Washington\u2019s resettlement priorities since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, set the stage for him and his allies to halt admissions altogether.\n\n\n\nSince the passage of the 1980 Refugee Act, the U.S. has been the world\u2019s leader in refugee resettlement, an effort that not only saves lives but also promotes U.S. interests abroad. It is also one that has historically enjoyed bipartisan backing from both Republicans and Democrats. Presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama used USRAP to admit nearly 80,000 refugees on average per year. Members of Congress from both parties historically approved State Department resettlement targets with little debate. And for good reason: Research has shown that, once in the U.S., refugees often revitalize communities, contribute meaningfully to the economy and earn U.S. citizenship at higher rates than other immigrants. So, while USRAP was not entirely free from criticism, it was one of the few migration policies that enjoyed strong support in Washington.

        "text": "Over the past few weeks, multiple clips of Elon Musk in action have gone viral across the world, each conveying evidence of the billionaire\u2019s transition from high-tech superstar to right-wing political activist. With every passing day, as he carries out his prominent role in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and wades ever more deeply into European politics, Musk is becoming an aspirational leader of a far-right movement that is rising across the democratic West.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s the video of Musk gleefully waving a chainsaw in an appearance alongside Argentine President Javier Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a symbol of both men\u2019s approach to slashing government spending and jobs. Another shows Musk with his four-year-old son on his shoulders in the Oval Office next to a seated Trump, lecturing the media about his cost-cutting plans.\n\n\n\nThen there is Musk\u2019s video address to a campaign rally for the ultra-rightwing party Alternative for Germany, or AfD, just before that country\u2019s elections, with only a Big Brother-style closeup of his head appearing on the screen. In his remarks, Musk not only threw his support behind a party that is viewed as too extreme even by some of the other right-wing populist parties across Europe. Speaking on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, he told the crowd that Germany should discard its guilt over its Nazi past and that the AfD is the only force that can \u201csave\u201d the country. The AfD ended up finishing second in the election, a strong showing and major advance on its previous electoral results, but there is no evidence that Musk\u2019s endorsement\u2014or that of Vice President JD Vance\u2014moved the needle.

        "text": "Taiwan criticized China earlier today for holding live-fire military exercises off the island\u2019s southwest coast without prior warning. The drills come just days after Australia and New Zealand said China should have given them more warning before staging live-fire exercises in the waters between the two countries Friday and Saturday. Those drills forced some passenger flights to divert midflight. (Reuters; AP)\n\n\n\nOur Take\nIn terms of the military exercises near Taiwan, there is nothing novel about China\u2019s provocative actions. Beijing has been engaging in constant saber-rattling toward Taiwan for years, in particular since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-ruled island in 2022. And the Chinese military has carried out drills, including full-scale war games, near Taiwan numerous times in the past three years.\n\n\n\nThe live-fire exercises between Australia and New Zealand are more eyebrow-raising, with the drills taking place further south than usual. The short notice\u2014only a couple hours, according to New Zealand\u2014is particularly troublesome, as live-fire drills require shutting down the airspace above the exercises and diverting some maritime traffic. That underscores Beijing\u2019s recent tendency to not be a responsible stakeholder in carrying out these activities.

        "text": "Most coverage of the South China Sea territorial disputes has understandably centered on China\u2019s assertiveness in pressing its territorial claim to the entire body of water. After all, using its notorious \u201cnine-dash line\u201d as justification, China has over the past 15 years undertaken extensive land reclamation projects and militarized the features it occupies in the disputed sea. As a result, less attention has focused on the activities of other claimants, which include Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, in addition to Taiwan, whose claims replicate those of Beijing. Of them all, Vietnam has been by far the most proactive in asserting its own sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.\n\n\n\nThese center on the Paracel Islands\u2014referred to as Hoang Sa in Vietnam\u2014in the northern part of the disputed sea, roughly equidistant from China\u2019s southern island province of Hainan and Vietnam\u2019s central coastline, and the Spratly Islands\u2014referred to as Truong Sa in Vietnam\u2014about 450 miles further south. While China has exercised de-facto control of the Paracel Islands since a brief battle with then-South Vietnam\u2019s naval forces in 1974, Hanoi has focused its efforts on boosting its defenses on features it controls in the Spratly Islands. According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, or AMTI, the pace of construction has picked up in recent years, to such an extent that Vietnam\u2019s total dredging and landfill in the South China Sea amounts to 2,360 acres\u2014roughly half of China\u2019s total of 4,650 acres.

        "text": "Representatives of states and civil society organizations will gather in New York next week at United Nations headquarters for the Third Meeting of State Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, or TPNW. The event brings together high-level diplomats and a massive global network of civil society organizations under the leadership of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, aimed at strengthening and implementing the nuclear weapons ban treaty, which prohibits both the possession and use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nTo some, it is a challenging moment to make the case for the power of multilateralism and international treaty law. U.S. President Donald Trump is actively withdrawing from or threatening to violate international treaties, as well as shutting down government agencies involved in implementing them. At the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, Vice President JD Vance indicated the U.S. would be pulling back from its security guarantees for Europe, possibly ushering in a new era of European defense spending due to resurgent fears of Russian aggression. At times it seems as if the power of international treaty law is weak at best, given its voluntary nature and limited enforcement mechanisms, and possibly crumbling altogether.\n\n\n\nPerhaps no place is this skepticism more frequently heard than in the area of nuclear weapons. After all, the TPNW has been created, signed and ratified by the world\u2019s non-nuclear states. Those with nuclear weapons have either ignored or openly opposed the treaty. Since the treaty\u2019s inception, nuclear threats and brinksmanship have been on the rise; the U.S. and Russia are aiming to modernize their nuclear forces; and rumblings about creating a nuclear deterrent have begun to be heard from some non-nuclear states.

        "text": "Hundreds of people attended Syria\u2019s two-day National Dialogue Conference, which wrapped up today in Damascus. The dialogue was billed by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa as the first step in Syria\u2019s political transition nearly three months after a rebel coalition led by al-Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, ousted longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad. (Washington Post)\n\n\n\nOur Take\nGiven how monumental the challenge of creating a sustainable new regime with political legitimacy in postwar Syria is, the fact that the National Dialogue Conference took place at all is encouraging. It underscores once again that Syria\u2019s interim leadership is willing to at the very least pay lip service to inclusivity and cross-sectarian outreach in the transitional process.\n\n\n\nIndeed, holding the conference by March 1 was one of the key promises HTS made soon after taking power, and al-Sharaa has repeatedly insisted that the new regime will protect minorities and women\u2019s rights. Given HTS\u2019 ideological leanings, these promises are key to gaining and maintaining support from Western countries, most notably with regard to sanctions relief as well as financing for the monumental reconstruction effort Syria\u2019s economy requires. But following through on those promises will also be key to building political legitimacy in a country where sectarian tensions\u2014exacerbated by the Assad regime and civil war\u2014run deep.

        "title": "Funding Freedom in China: Time for Private Donors to Step Up \u2013 The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Many Chinese civil society organizations became reliant on now-frozen U.S. government aid after funding from private U.S. organizations dried up. Even before the Trump administration\u2019s suspension of U.S. government funding for democracy and human rights projects as part of its freeze on foreign assistance, the American philanthropic sector had already largely abandoned the cause of human rights and democratic reform in China. In the 1990s, the\u00a0Ford Foundation had a robust program supporting civil society, civil and criminal legal reform, and marginalized communities in China but has since moved away from a strong rights-based focus. As part of a reorganization, the Open Society Foundations has shifted its work to thematic areas as opposed to doubling down on closed societies, such as China. This retreat comes at a time when Xi Jinping\u2019s rule is marked by growing repression and totalitarian rule that extends beyond China\u2019s borders as PRC agents intimidate and harass activists and ordinary citizens in the United States and other countries. Because of the private philanthropic sector\u2019s neglect, the U.S. government\u2019s funding suspension is causing a crisis among groups working to nurture political reform, with some civil society groups in China at risk of extinction. Private foundations and philanthropic institutions are missing an opportunity to support China\u2019s human rights defenders, independent religious groups (such as unregistered house churches), bloggers calling for democratic reform, independent media, and ethnic minority groups, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. Even foundations with missions that would be well-served by a focus on promoting an independent civil society as well as democratic and accountable governance in China neglect the crucial need to foster political liberalization. For example, the Gates Foundation, which focuses primarily on\u00a0health inequity and poverty in China, has shied away from addressing the foundational role that accountable and transparent governance plays in implementing sound public health policies and delivering sustainable development. Instead, they fund projects that support parts of the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to spread its international influence, such as a $1.6 million project for Tsinghua University to \u201cestablish a center of excellence for advocacy communications in global health and global development.\u201d This kind of approach not only risks supporting China\u2019s global sway, including spreading authoritarian governance practices, but it also forgets the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to squelch early warnings of the virus that would become known as COVID-19. In one poignant example, Dr. Li Wenliang, who was brought in for questioning after warning a private chat group about an emerging virus in Wuhan, ended up dying from the disease. Failing to support democratic values in China will end up harming U.S. interests.\u00a0The Chinese party-state under Xi Jinping has become increasingly antagonistic toward the United States despite U.S. support for economic development and the inclusion of the PRC in the international community ever since the late 1970s.\u00a0This animosity has even been expressed by Xi himself; in 2023, he stated that \u201cWestern countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way.\u201d The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is also hostile toward democratic ideals. CCP Document No. 9, a leaked party directive, warned that ideas such as \u201cthe separation of three powers, a multiparty system, a system of universal suffrage, independent judiciary, [and] a military belonging to the nation\u201d are all threats to the CCP regime. Nurturing respect for human rights and democratic reform in China aligns with U.S. national interests and long-standing U.S. values.\u00a0 The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s annual threat assessment names China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea \u2013 all authoritarian states \u2013 as specific threats to U.S. national security. The PRC government benefits from censoring dissident voices and controlling the media because it allows them to malign the U.S. and distort the United States\u2019 role in the world. Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan understood the necessity of supporting dissidents behind the Iron Curtain and promoting democratic ideals as an important Cold War policy tool. It was under his tenure that the United States established the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a nonpartisan grant-making institution. The impact of this kind of proactive and pragmatic funding is confirmed by the International Center for Nonviolent Conflict\u2019s\u00a0research, which finds that training and educating activists in closed societies, especially in non-violent resistance, results in more lasting and successful democratic breakthroughs. Yet the NED\u2019s congressional appropriation is facing scrutiny under the new administration. Instead of tackling dictatorial rule in China, the American philanthropic sector has adopted a fatalistic approach that assumes political reform is not possible or that their only option is to collaborate with the Chinese government. This pessimism does not consider the historical record, where democratic breakthroughs were often preceded by times of despair where political liberalization seemed unlikely. Private foundations and philanthropic organizations should pivot and put financial backing behind civil society groups working to combat PRC repression, including the detention and imprisonment of human rights lawyers, house church pastors, and ethnic Uyghurs and Tibetans. The investment needed to support this work is manageable for many deep-pocketed philanthropic actors, as a budget of even $5 million by a handful of donors would do much to\u00a0sustain this work. This is not an impossible task: the Ford Foundation\u2019s annual budget for China is $12 million annually\u00a0and the Gates Foundation has pledged $50 million over five years for a\u00a0Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, a collaboration between the Beijing Municipal Government and Tsinghua University. As it stands, the American philanthropic sector is missing important opportunities to fund independent voices and courageous political activism.\u00a0 For example, veteran reporter\u00a0Vivian Wu, who started the media outlet\u00a0Dasheng\u00a0(meaning \u201cmighty voice\u201d) seeks to get independent news to Chinese citizens.\u00a0As sources of funding have dwindled, Wu, who previously worked for BBC, uses personal savings to fund her analysis and posts on social media and YouTube. Her case is not unique. Civil society groups that were already operating on shoestring budgets now face the risk of folding because of the suspension of U.S. foreign assistance. Some of these groups played a crucial role in bringing to light not only egregious violations of Uyghur rights, including the forced sterilization of women in detention camps, but also the use of forced labor for Chinese exports emerging from the Uyghur region. Even if the U.S. government decides to permanently reduce foreign assistance, the American private sector can work to realize Reagan\u2019s vision that the country should be a \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s declaration that America \u201cshould make the world safe for democracy.\u201d Before he died in police custody, Nobel Peace Prize Winner Liu Xiaobo expressed this view when he wrote, \u201cI have viewed the West as if it were not only the salvation of China but also the natural and ultimate destination of all humanity.\u201d If the government and private donors both fail to rise to the occasion, it will represent an abdication of responsibility not only to U.S. citizens, but to those overseas who look to the United States for inspiration and hope.

        "title": "What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry | FiveThirtyEight",
        "text": "Impeachment By Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux Sep. 14, 2023, at 3:41 PM Photo Illustration by ABC News / Getty Images Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly-ish polling roundup. It\u2019s officially impeachment season again. On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced that he\u2019s directing three House committees to start investigating whether President Biden benefited from his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings overseas. McCarthy accused the Biden family of \u201ca culture of corruption,\u201d saying that the Biden administration gave Hunter \u201cspecial treatment\u201d in a criminal tax and gun investigation, and that Biden himself had lied about his knowledge of his son\u2019s financial dealings. The good news for McCarthy and the right-wing supporters of an impeachment investigation is that Americans do seem to believe, overall, that Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings were sketchy at best and illegal at worst. But Hunter Biden isn\u2019t the subject of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 his father is. So far, Republicans haven\u2019t provided any concrete evidence tying the president to his son\u2019s overseas business, although the impeachment inquiry may allow House Republicans to obtain bank records and other financial documents from Biden and his son. Right now, Republicans are most firmly convinced that Biden is implicated in Hunter\u2019s wrongdoing, while Americans overall are more inclined to see former President Donald Trump\u2019s family as corrupt, compared to the Bidens. And there isn\u2019t a broad consensus that an impeachment inquiry is warranted, signaling that Republicans have some convincing to do if they want the public to support their investigation. All of the allegations of a broader web of corruption within the Biden family have yet to be proven. What is less disputed, though, is the fact that Hunter Biden has personally made a significant amount of money through overseas business deals, and is the subject of a long-running criminal investigation. Earlier this summer, he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars of income in 2017 and 2018, with an additional agreement that could allow him to avoid a conviction on a separate illegal gun ownership charge, but the plea deal fell apart after the judge, a Trump appointee, said she refused to \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the agreement, which she said wasn\u2019t standard. Republicans accused the Biden administration of giving Hunter a \u201csweetheart\u201d deal and in August, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to continue probing Hunter Biden\u2019s finances. None of this is a great look for the president\u2019s son, and recent polling shows that Americans are unhappy about Hunter Biden\u2019s behavior. A YouGov/The Economist poll conducted in August, after the plea deal collapsed, found that 72 percent of Americans think Hunter Biden personally profited from his father\u2019s positions in government, including a slim majority (53 percent) of Democrats. The same poll found that two-thirds (66 percent) of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hunter Biden, while only 17 percent have a favorable view (an additional 17 percent said they didn\u2019t know). According to a Yahoo News survey conducted by YouGov in August, 59 percent of Americans think Hunter Biden traded on his family name and proximity to power to get millions of dollars from foreign business associates. The same poll found that 51 percent of Americans believe that Hunter Biden improperly claimed tens of thousands of dollars in tax deductions. And an Ipsos/Politico Magazine poll conducted in August found, similarly, that 59 percent of Americans think that Hunter Biden is guilty of the alleged crimes in the tax non-payment case, including 51 percent of Democrats. Notably, only 2 percent of respondents said they thought he wasn\u2019t guilty, and 38 percent said they didn\u2019t know. The YouGov/Economist poll\u2019s findings suggest, though, that Americans think most presidents\u2019 children get some level of special treatment. The survey found that 84 percent of respondents think children of U.S. presidents get away with things that other people do not because of their parents\u2019 jobs, and a similar share (85 percent) say that adult children personally profit from their parents\u2019 positions in government at least sometimes. So while Americans do seem convinced, overall, that Hunter Biden has profited financially from his father\u2019s jobs, and even a slim majority of Democrats think he likely committed crimes, the behavior may not be shocking or unexpected. RECOMMENDED Politics The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now Recommended The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans Why \u2018Bidenomics\u2019 Isn\u2019t Working For Biden Republicans don\u2019t really have to convince Americans that Hunter Biden deserves investigation, or even a criminal trial. But that\u2019s not the question that matters for impeaching his father. To justify impeaching the president, Republicans will have to prove that he was involved in financial wrongdoing or corruption that rises to the level of an impeachable offense. And so far, Republicans are making claims without facts to back them up. When he announced the inquiry, McCarthy asserted \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the millions Hunter Biden earned through overseas deals were also improperly shared with Biden family members, and that Biden used his official role as vice president to help get business for Hunter. More findings that tie Biden and his family to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings could, of course, emerge. But right now, Americans haven\u2019t fully bought into the idea that the Biden family is involved in a broader influence-peddling scheme. Less than half (41 percent) of respondents in the Yahoo poll said they believe that Hunter Biden funneled millions of dollars to his father in a long-running scheme to help Joe Biden profit off his position, while 26 percent said they didn\u2019t believe it and 33 percent said they didn\u2019t know. A similar share (44 percent) believe that Biden definitely or probably did something illegal regarding Hunter Biden, while 32 percent believe he definitely or probably did not and 32 percent said they don\u2019t know. Many Americans are not very tuned in to the allegations against the Bidens, which is probably why these questions result in such a high share of people who say they don\u2019t know. And another recent poll found a slightly higher share of people who say that even if Joe Biden didn\u2019t do something illegal, he may have acted unethically. According to an SSRS/CNN poll conducted in August, 61 percent of Americans agreed that Biden had at least some involvement in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, although less than half (42 percent) said he acted illegally and 18 percent said he acted unethically but not illegally. Similarly, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in September found that 35 percent of Americans thought Biden was involved and did something illegal in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with Ukraine and China, while 14 percent think he was involved and did something unethical but not illegal, and 37 percent think he wasn\u2019t involved. Share of respondents who said they believe that Hunter Biden did each of the following things, by party affiliation Source: YouGov/Yahoo News But as the table above shows, the people who really believe that the Biden family is corrupt are Republicans. Unsurprisingly, Democrats are much less convinced that the president did something wrong, and independents are also pretty divided. Of course, it\u2019s possible that more coverage of the allegations motivating the impeachment inquiry \u2014 and any concrete evidence that might get turned up along the way \u2014 could change people\u2019s minds, or at least persuade\u00a0 some of the ones who are undecided. And notably, the Yahoo News survey found that while the share of Americans \u2014 including the share of Democrats \u2014 who think Hunter Biden did something illegal has increased since last fall, the share of respondents who think Joe Biden broke the law has remained functionally unchanged, despite a drumbeat of Republican accusations to the contrary. Polling by Beacon Research/Shaw & Co. Research for Fox News has found a similar trend: The share of Americans who think Hunter Biden did something illegal rose from 39 percent last December to 50 percent in August, but the share of Americans who think Joe Biden did something illegal related to his son\u2019s business dealings hasn\u2019t really moved. (The survey found it at 35 percent in December versus 38 percent in August.) Perhaps most worryingly for Republicans, most Americans don\u2019t think an impeachment inquiry into Biden is warranted right now. A GBAO/Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll for The Wall Street Journal conducted in late August found that 52 percent of Americans oppose impeaching Biden, and only 41 percent are in favor. More recently, a YouGov poll conducted on September 13 found that 41 percent of Americans oppose impeaching Biden, 44 percent are in support and 15 percent don\u2019t know. In early October 2019, when Trump\u2019s first impeachment was getting underway, Americans were more closely divided, according to our polling tracker. And in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, majorities of Americans supported Trump\u2019s impeachment; a slim majority of Americans even consistently supported removing Trump from office before the end of his term. In fact, allegations of corruption are stickier when it comes to the Trump family than the Bidens. According to the Yahoo News survey, 46 percent of Americans think that Trump and his family are more corrupt than the Bidens, while 36 percent think the Bidens are more corrupt than the Trumps. And a recent AP-NORC poll found that Americans were more likely to describe Trump as \u201ccorrupt\u201d than Biden. Meanwhile, that September YouGov poll found that Americans are more likely to describe the impeachment inquiry as motivated by politics in an attempt to embarrass Biden (41 percent) rather than a serious effort to find out the truth (28 percent). That doesn\u2019t mean that Hunter Biden\u2019s legal troubles aren\u2019t a liability for Biden, particularly after a grand jury just indicted him on federal gun charges. A recent Emerson College poll found that while 47 of voters say that the indictments against Trump make them less likely to vote for him for president, 46 percent say the Hunter Biden tax and felony gun charges make them less likely to vote for Joe Biden in 2024. So it\u2019s possible that as Hunter Biden\u2019s investigation continues to unfold, his father could take political damage. But right now, Republicans aren\u2019t just missing evidence that Biden is connected to his son\u2019s wrongdoing in ways that could be impeachable \u2014 they also don\u2019t have the public on their side. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker,1 40.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 54.4 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -13.5 points). At this time last week, 40.0 percent approved and 56.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -16.0 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 40.8 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.5 percent, for a net approval rating of -13.8 points. CORRECTION (Sept. 18, 2023, 11:20 a.m.): A previous version of this article stated that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy asserted, without evidence, that Hunter Biden shared some of the money he received through foreign deals with his family. In fact, there is evidence that Hunter Biden\u2019s family members also received money through these deals, but in his announcement, McCarthy did not offer evidence that it was illegal or corrupt.

        "title": "The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump | FiveThirtyEight",
        "text": "2024 Republican Debates By Geoffrey Skelley Sep. 14, 2023, at 6:00 AM Joshua Lott / The Washington Post via Getty Images The second Republican presidential primary debate is less than two weeks away, so time is running out for GOP contenders to meet the Republican National Committee\u2019s qualification criteria. To make the Sept. 27 debate, each candidate must have at least 3 percent support in two qualifying national polls, or at least 3 percent in one national survey and that same figure in polls from two different early voting states,1 conducted since Aug. 1. Each candidate must also provide evidence of having attained at least 50,000 unique donors to their campaign.2 And if they have the polls and donors, candidates will once again have to sign a pledge to support the party\u2019s eventual 2024 nominee if they want to participate. As things stand, there\u2019s a decent chance that fewer candidates will qualify than the eight who attended the party\u2019s first gathering in August. Six of that octet appear to have the donors and polls to make the second debate, and each signed the RNC\u2019s pledge for the first debate, so there\u2019s no reason to think they won\u2019t sign again. However, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson may have trouble qualifying again under the higher September thresholds for polls and donors. And having skipped the first debate despite easily qualifying for it \u2014 save signing the RNC\u2019s pledge \u2014 former President Donald Trump looks set to eschew the second debate, too. Republican presidential candidates by whether and how they have qualified for the second primary debate and if they signed the first debate pledge, as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern on Sept. 13, 2023 Table only includes candidates who have met FiveThirtyEight\u2019s \u201cmajor\u201d candidate criteria. Polls qualification is based on surveys that appear to meet the Republican National Committee\u2019s requirements for inclusion. To qualify for the debate, candidates must meet both the polling and donor thresholds established by the Republican National Committee. To meet the polling requirement, a candidate must reach 3 percent in at least two national polls, or 3 percent in one national poll and two polls from the first four states voting in the GOP primary, each coming from separate states, based on surveys that meet the RNC\u2019s criteria for inclusion. To meet the donor requirement, a candidate must have at least 50,000 unique donors with at least 200 donors in at least 20 states and/or territories. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign reached 50,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 200 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well. To participate, candidates who have sufficient polls and donors must sign a pledge promising to support the eventual Republican presidential nominee. Source: POLLS, NEWS REPORTS FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis found that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy had at least 3 percent support in every qualifying survey (Trump did as well). Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie met that mark in nearly every survey, while South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott got there in about three-fourths of them. And none of these six candidates showed any sign of difficulty when it came to reaching the 50,000 donor mark. Even Pence\u2019s campaign, which had a harder time attracting donors than most, announced in mid-August that it had enough unique contributors to qualify for the second debate. With 11 days to go until the Sept. 25 qualification deadline, the polling threshold rising to 3 percent from 1 percent appears to be the main obstacle for the candidates who haven\u2019t qualified. Burgum announced in late July that he had 50,000 donors, but FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis found that he\u2019s reached 3 percent in just one statewide survey, a mid-August poll of Iowa from Trafalgar Group. Now, Burgum\u2019s campaign may argue that he\u2019s hit 3 percent in New Hampshire, based on either the 2.5 percent he garnered in another mid-August Trafalgar poll or the 4 percent he attained in an early-August poll from co/efficient on behalf of the New Hampshire Journal. We can\u2019t rule out that the RNC might count the second Trafalgar poll, although the RNC showed no indication that it was willing to round poll results reported with decimal places during qualification for the first debate. However, because co/efficient has polled for Trump this cycle, its New Hampshire survey won\u2019t count under the RNC polling rule that excludes polls conducted by organizations affiliated with a candidate or candidate committee. Yet regardless of whether he has polls from one or two early states, Burgum has struggled to hit the 3 percent mark in national surveys. It\u2019s no wonder that Best of America PAC, a super PAC supporting Burgum, reserved $4 million in ads between Aug. 30 and Sept. 24. However, there\u2019s not much evidence this has boosted Burgum: The most prolific national pollster, Morning Consult, has released data for seven nationwide surveys since Aug. 1, but Burgum garnered more than 0 percent just once, hitting 1 percent in a mid-August poll that predated the super PAC\u2019s ad buy. In fact, Burgum has reached 2 percent in just one national poll that sampled at least 800 likely Republican voters since Aug. 1, a Kaplan Strategies survey conducted right after the first debate. Meanwhile, Hutchinson needs both more polls and donors to make the stage, although he seems likely to reach the 50,000 contributor mark. Last week, a campaign spokesperson told ABC News that Hutchinson is \u201cvery close\u201d to the donor requirement, and he did get a last-minute surge in contributors to qualify for the first debate. On the polling front, Hutchinson has something Burgum doesn\u2019t: one national poll of 3 percent or better, thanks to a Kaplan Strategies survey taken before the first debate. But Hutchinson hasn\u2019t exceeded 1 percent in any potentially eligible nationwide poll conducted since the first debate. And he\u2019s done no better in early state surveys, making it unlikely that he\u2019ll get qualifying polls from two different states to combine with his one national survey to meet the RNC\u2019s other polling qualification route. It\u2019s difficult to imagine any other Republican will have a shot at qualifying for the September debate. Former Texas Rep. Will Hurd appears to have one qualifying poll from New Hampshire \u2014 a mid-August Echelon Insights/Republican Main Street Partnership survey \u2014 but like Burgum and Hutchinson, he has struggled to clear 1 percent in most surveys. And while Hurd could get to the 50,000 donor mark, his public refusal to consider signing the RNC\u2019s pledge nearly guarantees that he won\u2019t make the stage. Additionally, businessman Perry Johnson and radio host Larry Elder came close to qualifying for the first debate, and both have threatened legal action against the RNC alleging that it unfairly kept them off the stage. But even if Johnson and/or Elder can get to 50,000 donors \u2014 Johnson claimed to have that many in mid-August \u2014 neither candidate has a qualifying poll to his name. RECOMMENDED Politics What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry Read Now Recommended What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans Why \u2018Bidenomics\u2019 Isn\u2019t Working For Biden Lastly, Trump\u2019s presence \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 looms over the debate process. The former president is polling above 50 percent in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s national average, making him a clear favorite to win the GOP nomination. Yet while Trump\u2019s average fell slightly after the first debate, it has essentially recovered to its pre-debate position, suggesting voters didn\u2019t really penalize him for skipping the event. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that he seems intent on skipping the second debate and holding counterprogramming that evening, just as he did for the first debate when a pre-taped interview between Trump and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired at the same time. With Trump\u2019s likely absence, the second debate is once again setting up to be a clash among the party\u2019s leading alternatives, none of whom seem positioned to mount a significant challenge to Trump. Still, it\u2019s critical for these candidates to make the debate stage, as failing to qualify could signal to donors that their campaigns truly have no chance of success. Moreover, without Trump holding the spotlight, the debate will provide the other Republican contenders with an opportunity to be seen and heard by a large audience. That is a chance the candidates don\u2019t want to squander, as a sterling debate performance could \u2014 could \u2014 shift the course of their campaign.

        "title": "The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans | FiveThirtyEight",
        "text": "2024 Election By Nathaniel Rakich Sep. 13, 2023, at 6:40 PM Win McNamee / Getty Images On Wednesday, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney announced he would not run for reelection in 2024. On the surface, the electoral impact of Romney\u2019s decision is minimal \u2014 his seat should stay safely in Republican hands. But it\u2019s still notable because it represents the departure of one of the few remaining Republican senators who had a moderate voting record and/or vocally opposed former President Donald Trump. The Senate, of course, was a second (or, really, third) career for Romney. After a successful career in business during which he co-founded Bain Capital, Romney was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002 \u2014 part of the Bay State\u2019s long-standing love affair with moderate Republican governors. He ran for president twice and won the Republican nomination in 2012, losing to then-President Barack Obama in the general election. That was the last time the GOP chose a presidential nominee who wasn\u2019t Trump. Since 2016, Republican voters have turned against Romney\u2019s brand of establishment-aligned Republicanism and embraced Trump\u2019s brash populism. In 2018, a year that saw large numbers of moderate or anti-Trump Republicans leave Congress, Romney bucked the overall trend by getting elected to the Senate from Utah (where a large number of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 including Romney himself \u2014 have made the local GOP more Trump-skeptical than most). Since then, he has spoken out vocally against the party\u2019s new direction. Most notably, he voted to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials. Romney also developed a moderate voting record, breaking with the right wing of his party in votes ranging from confirming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to overturning Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to fund the border wall. Romney\u2019s DW-NOMINATE score \u2014 a measure of ideology based on roll-call votes, where 1 represents the most conservative and -1 represents the most liberal \u2014 is 0.288, making him more moderate than all but three current Republican senators. Both groups of Republicans \u2014 Trump opponents and ideological moderates \u2014 are endangered species now, and Romney\u2019s departure will further cull the herd. Of the 17 Republicans who voted to impeach or convict Trump in either of his impeachments, only six are still in Congress, including Romney. And the number of Senate Republicans with DW-NOMINATE scores below 0.300 is at its lowest point in at least 40 years. Romney\u2019s anti-Trump and moderate record may have indirectly contributed to his decision to retire, as it has made him relatively unpopular with Republican voters in Utah. According to an Aug. 7-14 poll by Dan Jones & Associates, only 56 percent of registered Republican voters in Utah approved of Romney\u2019s job performance. That may not seem too bad, but among members of your own party, 56 percent is a pretty mediocre approval rating. (By contrast, 81 percent of Republican registered voters nationally have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to the latest poll from Quinnipiac University.) Much like prominent Trump critic former Sen. Jeff Flake did in 2018, Romney may have declined to run for reelection because he was afraid of losing in the Republican primary. The same poll asked about a hypothetical primary match-up, and Romney received 45 percent support among Republicans. That\u2019s pretty anemic for an incumbent, who are accustomed to waltzing to renomination. RECOMMENDED Politics The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now Recommended The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry Why \u2018Bidenomics\u2019 Isn\u2019t Working For Biden On the other hand, no other candidate in the poll got more than 7 percent, and only 27 percent said they would vote for an unnamed other candidate. Furthermore, the poll found that Romney\u2019s approval rating among Republicans was on the rise; back in May, only 40 percent had approved of his performance. So Romney\u2019s path to renomination is probably clearer today than it has been for a while, making the timing of the announcement curious. So perhaps we should take Romney at his word when he cited his age as a factor in his retirement video. (Romney is 76 and would have been 83 at the end of a potential second term.) So what\u2019s next for Utah\u2019s Class I Senate seat? Romney\u2019s retirement is unlikely to lead to a competitive general election next fall: Even though Utah has shifted toward Democrats in the Trump era, it is still red enough that it voted for him by more than 20 percentage points in 2020, and Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide election in the Beehive State since 1996. (True, anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin lost to Republican Sen. Mike Lee in 2022 by only 10.4 points after Democrats stood aside and didn\u2019t nominate anyone in order to give McMullin a better shot at winning. But, on the other hand, anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin still lost to Republican Sen. Mike Lee in 2022 by 10.4 points even after Democrats stood aside and didn\u2019t nominate anyone in order to give McMullin a better shot at winning!) So the contest to watch will be the state\u2019s June 25 Republican primary \u2014 specifically, whether the party\u2019s nominee will be more conservative and/or pro-Trump than Romney. So far, it looks like the answer is yes; the field of candidates and potential candidates lacks someone as iconoclastic as Romney. State House Speaker Brad Wilson, who has already formed an exploratory committee, is pitching himself as a \u201cconservative champion,\u201d and in 2020 he introduced a legislative resolution paying tribute to Trump after his first impeachment. However, he may be the most palatable option for old-school Republicans; a second candidate, Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs, has assailed Romney for his support for \u201cwokeness\u201d and for impeaching Trump. And Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who served as co-chair of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in the state and attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is a rumored candidate as well. But there is still plenty of time for a Romney-esque candidate to jump in. Utah still has a fair number of Trump-skeptical Republicans \u2014 for example, former state Rep. Becky Edwards, a Republican who voted for President Biden and just narrowly lost a special primary election for Utah\u2019s 2nd District. It\u2019s possible that one could emerge from the Senate primary if the conservative/pro-Trump vote is split among multiple candidates. But of course, none of the alternatives have Romney\u2019s name recognition or financial advantage. So there\u2019s no doubt his retirement is a gut punch for Republicans who don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening to their party.

        "text": "2024 Election A FiveThirtyEight Chat Sep. 12, 2023, at 4:07 PM Welcome to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited. nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior elections analyst): For a long time, the economy has been seen as a big liability for President Biden in his reelection bid. Inflation soared in 2021 and 2022, culminating at a rate of 9.1 percent last June. The same month, average gas prices exceeded $5 per gallon. And in the second quarter of 2022, the gross domestic product actually decreased by 0.6 percent. It was little surprise, then, that only 28 percent of Americans approved of the way Biden was handling the economy in a July 2022 Quinnipiac University poll. But in recent months, economic indicators have been looking up, and Biden has begun making the case that his economic policies are working. Yet Americans don\u2019t seem to be changing their perceptions of his stewardship of the economy. (The last Quinnipiac poll put his approval rating on the economy at 36 percent.) So for today\u2019s FiveThirtyEight Slack chat, I want to explore why that is, and whether Biden has any hope of actually making the economy a winning issue for him in next year\u2019s election. First, though, let\u2019s set the scene: What are indicators saying right now about the health of the economy? ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior reporter): For an economy that\u2019s allegedly been on the brink of a recession for over a year now, it\u2019s looking pretty good! Real wages are finally rising faster than inflation, the labor market is weakening a bit but is still fairly strong for workers and consumers are still spending at a healthy rate. Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): What Amelia said. For starters, the job market remains really strong. Unemployment is at 3.8 percent, and wages are rising. Inflation, at just over 3 percent, is finally cooling, too. The Federal Reserve seems to be succeeding in its high-wire act of lowering inflation without causing too much unemployment. There are other signs, too. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred investment in manufacturing, which the White House has been more than happy to point to. RECOMMENDED Politics The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now Recommended The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans ameliatd: In a lot of ways, it looks like the economy is finally returning to its pre-pandemic normal \u2014 but with conditions that are a bit more worker-friendly. That mythical \u201csoft landing\u201d is actually looking like it could come to pass. Of course, economists\u2019 recession predictions are never very reliable. (This is a time-honored FiveThirtyEight refrain.) And things can always shift \u2014 for example, as Monica wrote recently, student loan repayment is about to restart, which will mean millions of Americans have less money to spend as they resume their monthly payments. But it\u2019s still a rosier situation than a lot of people were predicting even just a few months ago. gelliottmorris (G. Elliott Morris, editorial director of data analytics): That\u2019s right. Some of the doomer predictions of a recession were never really reliable, but aggregate economic expectations are still up relative to what people were saying a year or even six months ago. That said, there are some not-so-hot indicators. Mortgage and interest rates are continuing to climb, for example, and the personal savings rate is nearly at an all-time low. That\u2019s a different dimension of \u201cthe economy\u201d than, say, annual growth in wages, but it\u2019s an important one. ameliatd: Right, Elliott, and it\u2019s not clear that the Fed is done with rate hikes. A lot will depend on what the August 2023 inflation data looks like when it comes out later this week. Monica Potts: Yes, I think that hints at a really big and persistent problem with asking voters how they feel about \u201cthe economy.\u201d What that term means to people can vary a great deal. Does it mean how much money they\u2019re making, or how much they spend on things like housing and food? Does it mean whether they can afford daycare? There is a huge variation in how people feel about the economy \u2014 and many different ways the federal government can have an effect on those things. ameliatd: Another question is whether consumer spending will start to tick down \u2014 which has been a possibility as people spend down their pandemic savings. But generally, there are other signs that Americans are feeling OK about their finances. For example, a recent Ipsos poll found that the share of Americans who say they have enough money to cover an unplanned expense (54 percent) is higher than at this time last year (40 percent). Fewer people are also saying that after they pay their bills, they don\u2019t have enough money to spend on things they want. nrakich: And yet, despite this, Biden is having trouble convincing voters that \u201cBidenomics\u201d is working. Why? Monica Potts: To start at the beginning, Biden inherited a really weird economy. The COVID-19 shutdowns caused a severe and dramatic recession, but then the economy started to bounce back. But people\u2019s behavior had also changed. More people were working from home and moving, they had cash to spend and supply chains were slow to restart. So Americans were generally sour on the economy from the time he took office. The recovery was afflicted by super-high inflation, as you noted at the beginning, Nathaniel, and a lot of what the Biden administration has done on economic policy is the kind of slow-moving, behind-the-scenes policymaking that voters don\u2019t really notice. Even though inflation is cooling, prices are still much higher than they were before the pandemic; borrowers are still seeing much higher interest rates; etc. So I think a lot of it is that Americans are generally unhappy with the new normal we find ourselves in. gelliottmorris: I think that last point is a really good one, Monica. The share of people telling pollsters that the broader economic situation is poor is still around the highest it\u2019s been since 2018. At first, that seems hard to square with the rosy economic indicators we talked about. But I think it\u2019s possible that people just have longer-term memories about economic growth and remember a time when prices were meaningfully lower. Lots of the discussion on this topic is pegged to tracking annual change in the consumer price index or job market or what have you. But if you take a longer view, for a lot of families, things are just permanently more expensive now. Even if their wages are up, I doubt they enjoy spending 15 percent more at the grocery store than they were before the pandemic. And it will take a while for those memories to fade. Of course, that\u2019s just my theory. ameliatd: I mean, some people think the economy is improving. Civiqs\u2019s tracking poll shows that Democrats, in particular, are more likely to say that the current condition of the economy is fairly or very good (63 percent) than they were a year ago (53 percent). But that\u2019s not quite the question you\u2019re asking, Nathaniel \u2014 it\u2019s not just whether people think the economy is getting better, it\u2019s whether people are seeing an improvement and saying, \u201cYeah, Biden is making that happen!\u201d And there, it doesn\u2019t seem like Biden is getting much of a boost. According to a recent Wall Street Journal poll, for example, the share of registered voters who say they approve of the way Biden is handling the economy hasn\u2019t meaningfully changed since April. Which gets to my theory about what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m not sure voters were ever going to give Biden credit for an improving economy, especially because the inflation increase happened under his watch. It\u2019s not like he can come in and say, \u201cLook at this mess my predecessor left for me.\u201d But! That doesn\u2019t mean this turn of events isn\u2019t good for him, because the alternative \u2014 a souring economy \u2014 could really hurt him. nrakich: Interesting, Amelia. So you think that the stink of the bad economy of a year or two ago is permanent for Biden? He can never wash it off, even if he fixes it? ameliatd: I don\u2019t know about permanent, but as Elliott said, prices are still higher. Americans are increasingly convinced that those high prices are here to stay. So the fact that people are starting to get used to those higher prices and are saying the economy is improving could be an indication that Biden\u2019s dodging a bullet. So it depends on how you frame it. On the one hand, people aren\u2019t giving Biden credit, so that\u2019s unfortunate for him. But on the other, it\u2019s looking increasingly like we might have a normal-ish economy heading into 2024, which you could see as a huge win considering how much economic volatility we\u2019ve seen since the pandemic started. Monica Potts: I don\u2019t think prices will go down, but it\u2019s also possible people will just get used to them. So they could hurt Biden less, as Amelia said. And that leaves room for other issues voters care about to rise in importance. nrakich: Question, though: How much does getting that win really matter politically? Historically, what has been the correlation between the health of the economy and presidential reelection chances? ameliatd: Would Biden love for \u201cBidenomics\u201d to show up in high school history textbooks? Sure. But what he really wants is to win reelection, and that is much less likely to happen if people think the economy is getting worse. gelliottmorris: Historically, we know that actual economic conditions are pretty well correlated with presidential election outcomes. If the state of the economy is broadly positive compared with a year or two ago, then the incumbent party tends to get a boost. Of course, economic indicators do not fully predict outcomes of elections, but they do have a residual impact. The good news for Biden on this front is twofold: First, voters tend to start making these retrospective evaluations closer to the election. And second, that they look only a couple years in the past. That means there is time for things to get even better for him, and for him to be rewarded. The bad news for Biden, though, is that there's still time for things to turn against him!

        "text": "Ron DeSantis By Nathaniel Rakich Sep. 11, 2023, at 2:34 PM ABC News Photo Illustration / Win McNamee / Getty Images In his presidential campaign, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has pitched himself as a transformational leader who has reshaped the politics of his home state. His 2022 reelection by 19 percentage points \u201cwas not just a big victory,\u201d he has argued. \u201cIt was really a fundamental realignment of Florida from being a swing state to being a red state.\u201d And most political analysis agrees that the Sunshine State, once known for its impossibly close elections, is now a comfortably Republican-leaning state. But it\u2019s unclear how much credit DeSantis himself deserves for this shift \u2014 or if it even counts as a realignment at all. The most prominent argument in his favor, that Republicans have moved to the state thanks to his COVID-19 policies, is hard to prove. His investment in the state GOP appears to have paid real dividends, but several other factors contributed to that push\u2019s success. He probably didn\u2019t have much to do with another one of Florida Republicans\u2019 biggest accomplishments over the past few years: their inroads with Hispanic voters. And finally, there\u2019s considerable doubt over whether DeSantis\u2019s premise \u2014 that Florida will continue to be a safe Republican state going forward \u2014 is even correct. The data suggests DeSantis\u2019s 2022 rout was a historical outlier, driven by a massive partisan turnout gap, and it\u2019s unwise to make sweeping pronouncements based on just one election. Ask many Florida Republicans, and they\u2019ll tell you Florida has gotten redder because DeSantis\u2019s famous opposition to COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic drew anti-lockdown Republicans to the state in droves. \u201cCOVID, and Gov. DeSantis\u2019s policies that were implemented during COVID, is in my view responsible for the deeper shade of red that Florida has now become,\u201d said Justin Sayfie, a prominent Florida Republican political consultant. The problem with this theory is that Florida\u2019s population was already expanding even before COVID-19 hit. It\u2019s true that the pandemic had a particularly big impact on Florida: According to American Community Survey estimates, 674,740 people moved to Florida from a different state or the District of Columbia in 2021, the biggest influx of domestic migrants into any state.1 But by Florida\u2019s standards, it wasn\u2019t that unusual. While the 2021 uptick was a bigger number than any year from 2011 to 2019, it was consistent with the general trend of more and more people moving to Florida as the decade wore on. And only 73,129 more domestic migrants moved to Florida in 2021 than in 2019, before the pandemic. Of course, these newcomers to the Sunshine State could be qualitatively different from their pre-pandemic predecessors: more Republican, more ideologically motivated. Sayfie says that, anecdotally, several recent transplants have told him that they moved to escape COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re coming is that they\u2019re political refugees. They\u2019re seeking refuge from the policies in their home states.\u201d RECOMMENDED Politics The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now Recommended The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans But all the old reasons people moved to Florida before the pandemic didn\u2019t go away overnight, either. We couldn\u2019t find a scientific poll asking people why they moved to Florida, but the Tampa Bay Times put out an open call for answers to that question in 2022, and the most common responses were lower taxes, affordable housing prices and good weather. That\u2019s consistent with research that has found that most people who move do so for financial, not political reasons. (To be sure, \u201clower taxes\u201d counts as a political reason to move \u2014 but it\u2019s not one that DeSantis can take credit for, as the state constitution has banned personal income taxes since 1968.) A few respondents to the Tampa Bay Times did cite coronavirus restrictions as a reason for their move, so it\u2019s possible that some of the increase in migration from 2019 to 2021 was because of DeSantis\u2019s policies. On the other hand, several respondents also cited their newfound ability to work remotely, which is another possible explanation for the 2021 spike. Overall, it\u2019s tough to say with any confidence that DeSantis\u2019s COVID-19 policy caused a significant number of people to move to the state who wouldn\u2019t have done so otherwise, much less an influx of new residents that was large enough to change the state\u2019s political composition. DeSantis probably had more of an impact on Florida\u2019s political hue by investing in campaign field operations to expand the state GOP. There are currently 525,418 more registered Republican voters in Florida than there were at the end of 2018, and some of that growth can be credited to DeSantis. Shortly after his 2019 inauguration, he directed the state GOP to focus on registering more Republican voters. The GOP\u2019s net increase of more than 40,000 voters that year was the party\u2019s biggest gain in the year before a presidential election this century. Then, in 2020, the party added a modern record of nearly half a million voters on net. In 2021, DeSantis contributed $2 million to the registration push, and it paid off that November, when the number of registered Republicans at last surpassed the number of registered Democrats. Finally, in 2022, amid DeSantis\u2019s reelection campaign, the GOP capped off an impressive quadrennium by adding 188,323 Republicans to the rolls on net. You guessed it: That was the most for a midterm year in at least 20 years. But as helpful as DeSantis was to these efforts, he can\u2019t take full credit. As the chart above makes clear, Republicans had been closing the registration gap with Democrats for quite some time \u2014 and their efforts really went into overdrive starting in 2016, a couple of years before DeSantis came on the scene. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign probably deserves kudos for the dramatic increase in Republican registration in both 2016 and 2020. And in their quest to take the lead in party registration, Republicans got the biggest assist from an unlikely source: Democrats. In addition to those 525,418 more registered Republicans, Florida also has 299,808 fewer registered Democrats than it did at the end of 2018 \u2014 despite the state\u2019s population growth. The Florida Democratic Party has, for years, been in shambles, and they have been unable to invest in the kind of registration efforts necessary to combat natural attrition from the voter rolls. If the party had simply been able to hold steady at the 5,315,954 registered voters it had at the end of 2020, registered Democrats would still outnumber Republicans statewide \u2014 despite DeSantis\u2019s best efforts. You also can\u2019t talk about the GOP\u2019s recent dominance in Florida without talking about the significant inroads they\u2019ve made among Latinos. According to Catalist, a Democratic-aligned data firm that uses the voter file to analyze past elections, Hispanic support for Florida Democrats cratered in 2022. Former Rep. Charlie Crist, Democrats\u2019 gubernatorial nominee, got just 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. By contrast, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received 66 percent of the Hispanic vote as recently as the 2016 presidential race.2 That\u2019s a big deal in a state whose citizen voting-age population is 21 percent Hispanic. But it\u2019s hard to say that Hispanic voters are moving right because of DeSantis. For one thing, the Republican shift started well before the 2022 campaign. In 2020, President Biden got just 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in Florida, according to Catalist, which accounts for most of the drop between 2016 and 2022. If anyone deserves credit for this, it\u2019s probably Trump, who appealed to Hispanic voters with his own push to reopen the economy during the pandemic, as well as with targeted outreach to Florida\u2019s diverse Hispanic communities. And of course, Latinos\u2019 rightward swing is a national phenomenon, not just a Florida one. Nationally, Hispanic support for Democrats fell from 71 percent in 2016 to 62 percent in both 2020 and 2022.3 That said, Latinos did continue to move toward Republicans between 2020 and 2022 in Florida when they did not do so nationally. That could have been thanks to DeSantis, or it could have been because Florida\u2019s Hispanic population is unique (while most Latinos nationally are Mexican American, Florida\u2019s Hispanic community mostly consists of people of Cuban, Puerto Rican and South American descent, who may have different political priorities). Or there might not have been movement at all, and Republicans ended up with higher support among Latinos in 2022 simply because many Hispanic Democrats in Florida just didn\u2019t bother turning out to vote in 2022. According to Florida Democratic data analyst Matthew Isbell, there were 959,980 Latinos registered as Democrats in Florida at the time of the 2022 election, versus just 728,027 who were registered as Republicans. But only about one-third of those Hispanic Democrats actually voted, compared with more than half of Hispanic Republicans, which meant that the actual electorate contained more Hispanic Republicans than Hispanic Democrats. In other words, a lot of DeSantis\u2019s success with Latinos in 2022 was due to disparities in turnout. Dive into the turnout numbers for 2022 and an even bigger problem for DeSantis\u2019s narrative emerges. A lot of DeSantis\u2019s success across the board was due to disparities in turnout. Overall, Isbell found that 63.4 percent of Florida\u2019s registered Republicans cast a ballot in 2022, but only 48.6 percent of its registered Democrats did. That 14.8-point turnout gap was way out of line with the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections in Florida. Share of Democratic registered voters who cast a ballot versus the share of Republican registered voters who cast a ballot, in Florida general elections since 2012 Source: MCI Maps Forget the question of whether DeSantis deserves credit for Florida\u2019s swing to the right \u2014 this raises the question of how much Florida has swung at all. After all, 2022 was only one election, and history is rife with examples of landslide victories in swing states that didn\u2019t permanently change the states\u2019 political nature. (Take Nevada, which reelected then-Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval by 47 points in 2014 in between voting for then-President Barack Obama by 7 points in 2012 and Clinton by 2 points in 2016.) There is evidence that Florida has been drifting toward Republicans in recent years, but that trend predates DeSantis, and there was no sign before 2022 that it would become a state where Republicans win by 19 points with any regularity. How Florida has voted in presidential and gubernatorial elections since 2000 Source: Dave Leip\u2019s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections Given all the evidence, it seems more likely that DeSantis is \u201cjust\u201d a strong candidate with a strong political operation than a politician who has fundamentally reshaped Florida politics. Even Sayfie, who does believe DeSantis has helped make Florida somewhat redder, thinks 2022 will prove to be an outlier. DeSantis got extra credit from voters because of his anti-lockdown policies during the pandemic, he said, that future Republican candidates won\u2019t benefit from. \u201cThat perfect political storm will not happen again.\u201d No data is available from 2020, the first year of the pandemic. Catalist\u2019s numbers represent two-way vote share between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 that is, they disregard third-party votes. Based on presidential numbers for 2016 and 2020 and the national House popular vote for 2022.

        "text": "Age By Monica Potts Sep. 7, 2023, at 6:00 AM Drew Angerer / Getty Images Presidents are getting older and older. Former President Donald Trump was the oldest person to assume office when he was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, and President Biden broke that record four years later. If either is elected again next year, at ages 78 and 81, respectively, they will be older than the previous record holder, Ronald Reagan, was when he left office at the age of 77. The possibility of an octogenarian on the presidential ticket is worrying many Americans \u2014 perhaps because it\u2019s not just the presidency that\u2019s aging. The current Congress, with a median age of 65 in the Senate and 58 in the House, is the oldest in history. Last week, when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 81, seemed to freeze while speaking for the second time in two months, there were renewed calls for him to step aside, and 90-year-old California Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been under similar scrutiny after a series of health issues. Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who is 51 and running for the Republican nomination, has called for competency tests for candidates older than 75, and her opponent Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, has said it\u2019s time for a new generation to step up and lead. Voters are worried about the age of candidates and elected officials, especially when it comes to Biden. The vast majority of American adults, 77 percent, say he is too old to be effective for another four years, according to an AP-NORC poll in August. Fifty-seven percent of registered voters thought age severely limited President Biden\u2019s ability to do his job in an Economist/YouGov poll from August. Similar questions were asked about Feinstein and McConnell, about whom 60 percent said the same. But will voters actually start rejecting candidates because of their age? There are plenty of reasons why older politicians continue to hold the levers of power \u2014 and the structure of our political system makes it hard to force them to let go, even as Americans\u2019 concerns about the country\u2019s aging political leadership mount. That\u2019s why Americans may continue to support older politicians when they\u2019re in the voting booth, even as they say they prefer a younger leadership cohort. Biden might be the oldest president in U.S. history, but worries about whether presidents are too old for the job have been floating around for a while. Americans became increasingly worried about Reagan\u2019s age during his tenure. At the start of his second term in 1985, 33 percent of respondents in an ABC/Washington Post poll said Reagan was too old to be president, but by 1987 that number had risen to 42 percent. And a January 1987 poll from Louis Harris & Associates found that 48 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that Reagan was getting too old to be president. In the modern era, presidents have traditionally released details about their health, and the public has demanded transparency, because the job is physically and mentally demanding and voters want to ensure that the person they elect is the one doing it. Anxieties about that have a basis in past events: President Woodrow Wilson was able to hide the effects of a stroke in 1919 from most of the American public, and his wife, Edith, essentially acted as de facto president until his second term ended in 1921. Later, in 1967, the ratification of the 25th Amendment outlined what should happen if a president died or became incapacitated. But presidents haven\u2019t always been forthcoming with information. In the absence of diagnoses, voters have often relied on outward signs that their candidates might be unable to do their jobs. Perhaps the most obvious is a candidate\u2019s age, simply because we face the greater chance of serious medical problems and death the older we get. RECOMMENDED Politics The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now Recommended The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump What Americans Think Of The Biden Impeachment Inquiry The Senate Is Losing One Of Its Few Remaining Moderate Republicans But in practice, it\u2019s hard to draw bright lines \u2014 in part because age is far from a perfect proxy for health. Some older politicians are perceived as more capable than others: Thirty-four percent of voters thought the age of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is almost 82, severely limited his ability to do his job in the August Economist/YouGov poll, and 28 percent said age would limit Trump\u2019s ability to be president if he were elected again. Those differences suggest that it\u2019s not just ageism, but the specific health conditions of some politicians being reported in the media that voters are responding to; or, in Biden\u2019s case, reporting on every stumble on the stairs to Air Force One. The health conditions that can come with age, even chronic ones that require accommodations, don\u2019t necessarily mean that elected officials can\u2019t effectively serve, either, which speaks to a broader issue on how voters make assumptions about candidates\u2019 fitness for office. For example, people with physical and mental disabilities are underrepresented in government, with only 1 in 10 elected representatives having a disability, while nearly 16 percent of adults in the overall population have one, according to a study from Rutgers University. As Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman\u2019s campaign showed, candidates can face discrimination when disabilities are conflated with cognitive ability. The need for accommodation doesn\u2019t mean an elected representative is unable to work. \u201cYou also don\u2019t want to lose the potential contributions of somebody who is older but is quite talented and also now has the benefit of experience to bring to the table,\u201d said James M. Curry, a political scientist at the University of Utah. Some voters, though, think we should have clearer rules about when a politician is too old to serve. Sixty-seven percent of respondents strongly or somewhat supported an age limit for serving in the Senate in a YouGov/UMass Amherst poll from June, and 58 percent of adults thought age limits for serving as president would be a good idea in a Marist poll from last November. Sixty-eight percent of respondents favored mental competency tests for candidates over 75 in a YouGov/Yahoo survey from February. A plurality, 48 percent, think the job of president is too demanding for someone over 75, according to a CBS/YouGov poll from June. And overall, Americans\u2019 preference for younger leadership is clear: About half of Americans think the ideal age for a president is someone in their 50s, according to the Pew Research Center. The risk of a politician becoming unable to do their job isn\u2019t the only worry that might be fueling these perceptions. The age of voters and the members of Congress they elect means that programs and issues important to older voters, from Social Security to elder abuse, are more likely to get attention than issues more important to younger voters, like student loans. \u201cI think the biggest reason that younger Americans want younger lawmakers is they feel they\u2019re not well represented by older Americans, both from a standpoint of the things that older representatives might focus on or talk about that are different from what a younger candidate might talk about,\u201d but also because, like all Americans, they want to see themselves represented in government, Curry said. Younger Americans are missing that representation now. \u201cIt makes them less satisfied with their representative government and less satisfied with their democracy,\u201d he said. It\u2019s also possible, though, that despite what they say, voters prefer reelecting someone with experience and seniority. \u201cThe Constitution sets minimum ages for the presidency and for the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, but it doesn\u2019t set a maximum,\u201d said William J. Kole, the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Big 100: The New World of Super-Aging.\u201d \u201cAnd you have to believe that the Framers clearly valued experience over youth. That\u2019s part of our DNA in some ways, politically.\u201d There are a few factors contributing to our aging politics, and they provide a hint as to why voters are choosing older candidates despite saying in polls that they would prefer younger ones. The first is simple demographics. Older voters are more likely to vote and are more likely to choose candidates closer to their age. Younger generations of voters didn\u2019t overtake the Baby Boom generation until 2018. Millennials now outnumber Baby Boomers as America\u2019s largest generation, but the youngest millennials, at age 25, are just now old enough to qualify to run for federal office. The Constitution requires candidates for the U.S. House to be at least 25 and at least 30 for the Senate, and most candidates have prior experience before running for those big-ticket spots. They also need to build name recognition and a fundraising base. Because of that, even Gen X and Millennials are still lagging in representation. That leaves Baby Boomers overrepresented in Congress, taking almost half the positions. And it\u2019s also difficult to force older generations to let go of power if they don\u2019t want to step down. There\u2019s a strong incumbency bias for federal office, and the current structure of Congress rewards seniority, enabling longer-serving members with plum committee assignments to get more attention for their constituents\u2019 needs. In the past century, average lengths of service for members of Congress have increased as members have become more likely to seek and win reelection. The cost to run for office has also increased, and incumbent politicians have a huge fundraising advantage. In the U.S., the decision on whether to run for reelection is largely left to the candidates themselves. In countries with different systems, governing bodies can be more representative because parties can exert more pressure on candidates to leave and more effectively recruit younger members to serve. It may be that American voters aren\u2019t electing younger candidates because they don\u2019t have the options in front of them. As Americans continue to live longer and longer, this may just be the future of politics. \u201cI think, honestly, it\u2019s up to older leaders to be self-aware enough to find the time to step aside,\u201d Kole said.

        "title": "Getting Over Germanophobia - The American Conservative",
        "text": "Hand-wringing over the emergence of nationalist tones in German politics is based on shoddy history. I know I\u2019ve been on this topic for more than 40 years and have published screeds on it in both English and German. Unfortunately, neoconservatives are not likely to let go of this obsession; and I therefore go on expatiating on it. By now Germanophobia may be in the neocon DNA. Yes, I fully understand why the Nazi dictatorship in Germany would upset neoconservative publicists; and as someone whose family suffered under that regime, I can sympathize with their concern that something like the Third Reich should never return to Central Europe. But what this id\u00e9e fixe has produced is a distorted or overgeneralized view of the German past that seems to have infected the American right, or at least that part of the right that enjoys a widespread media presence and social respectability. There also seems to be a special fixation among neocons and their dependents on the evils of Imperial Germany. Apparently Nazi tyranny was only a replay of the horrors of the German monarchy. Having made a far from exhaustive collection of some of the expressions of anti-German rage syndrome coming from recognizably neoconservative sources over the last two decades, allow me to list some of them. (I avoid mentioning the misinformed by name lest I cause unnecessary offense.) Allow me to note, in stating my position, that I have never claimed that the Germans and Austrians deserve no blame for the outbreak of the Great War. But like Christopher Clark, Niall Ferguson, Sean McMeekin, Rainer Schmidt, Thomas Nipperdey, and a host of other respectable historians, I have argued (I think quite reasonably) that the blame for the catastrophe that erupted in the summer of 1914 was fairly well distributed between the two sides. Moreover, the U.S., which enjoyed an enormous industrial and demographic advantage over England and Germany, would have emerged the hegemonic power no matter which side had won in Europe. By the 1870s, the U.S. had become the world\u2019s premier industrial power. During the First World War, it surpassed England as the world\u2019s financial capital. Two books about ending the war that I highly recommend are Georges-Henri Soutou\u2019s La Grande Illusion and Burton Yale Pines\u2019s The Greatest Blunder. Both of these well-researched tomes show how the belligerents would have reached mutually acceptable peace terms by the end of 1917 if the U.S. had not entered the war. The American presence encouraged the French to demand much harsher peace terms and unnecessarily prolonged the war. The assertion that the Germans planned to invade the U.S. is utter nonsense. What some Germanophobic neocons have discovered is that the German high command kept war contingency plans in case their country became embroiled with some other power. This was a common practice in both alliance camps before 1914. Further, there is no good reason to condemn opponents of America\u2019s entry into the First World War as bad people who hated democracy. The U.S. should have stayed genuinely neutral in that war, which our government never really was. And the passionate Anglophile government of Woodrow Wilson should have worked as an honest peacemaker between the two sides. And, oh yes, the Lusitania, which a German U-boat sank in 1915, was falsely registered as a passenger ship: It was really a warship loaded with arms earmarked for the Allied side. More generally, the neoconservative charge that the Germans sabotaged American arms producers during the First World War, which should have been a reason to declare war on Germany, overlooks the indisputable fact that all American arms were going to Britain to be used against German soldiers: The arms manufacturers were overwhelmingly pro-British, and there was no way that American arms could have reached German customers because of the British blockade. I\u2019m also not sure how Imperial Germany created the Arab nationalist movement. In this matter I lean heavily toward the evidence provided by the Iraqi Sephardic historian Elie Kedourie that the Royal Institute of International Affairs and various English missionaries in the 19th century carried nationalist ideas to the Middle East. The Turkish nationalist movement identified with Mustafa Kemal Ataturk did reflect German ideas about military organization, but its model for a secular republic came from revolutionary France, not Berlin. A reference to the \u201chorrific history\u201d of the Germans in explaining their present antifascist globalist managerial government seems woefully inadequate without noting the forced \u201creeducation\u201d of Germany. This was a mental reconstruction process launched by the post\u2013Second World War American military government which continued throughout its occupation. The occupying powers drove home the message that until the total defeat of the Third Reich Germany had pursued an aberrant nationalist course (Sonderweg); and nothing less than a total reeducation, assisted by the indigenous and American\u00a0 antifascist left, would enable future generations of Germans to abjure their national identity and become \u201cworld citizens.\u201d Several of my books deal extensively with what the Bavarian critic Caspar von Schrenk-Notzing, who has written a detailed study of this process, bluntly describes as \u201cpure brainwashing.\u201d Bourgeois civil liberties of the kind the Germans and their government now scorn were in no way prioritized in their forced reeducation. In 1951 the American occupiers reestablished the Frankfurt School at the University of Frankfurt to assist in the reconstructing of German minds. In 1949 the Germans were required to sign a secret agreement with the American occupying power that no German politician would be allowed to become chancellor without the American government\u2019s approval.\u00a0 This practice, we know, continued for decades, and this Kanzlerakte (Chancellor\u2019s File)\u00a0may still be in effect. Certainly, there is no indication that it has ended. What we are seeing is by no means a continuation of Germany\u2019s supposedly uninterruptedly evil history. It is, at least partly, the predictable consequence of arrogant imperialism. It was not enough to get rid of the Nazi government, which was necessary for the safety of the Western world. American globalist crusaders also sought to replace German identity with a therapeutically engineered form of antifascism. The anti-freedom politics and irresponsible immigration policies practiced by Germany\u2019s leftist government cannot be fully contextualized without noting the American attempt to reeducate a conquered people.

        "title": "Time to Face Reality: North Korea Is a Nuclear Power - The American Conservative",
        "text": "For now, President Trump should seek to freeze, not end, Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program. American foreign policy is often built on illusions. One is that North Korea must not possess nuclear weapons. Of course, it developed them long ago. The only questions today are how many nukes will Pyongyang produce, and who will it target? The answers, unfortunately, almost certainly are \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201cAmerica.\u201d About this threat President Joe Biden did nothing. Out of office little more than a month, Biden is already largely forgotten. He bungled policy around the world, including toward the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. He offered to talk to Pyongyang, but not about anything of interest to the DPRK\u2019s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Washington insisted on denuclearization, which Kim long ago rejected. Instead, he expanded the North\u2019s arsenal and developed longer range missiles. Kim said Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear status was \u201cirreversible\u201d and insisted that \u201cthere can be no bargaining over our nuclear weapons.\u201d He later explained: \u201cthe U.S. and its vassal forces have still perpetrated vicious anti-DPRK confrontational moves, and the desperate efforts of the enemies have reached the extremes unprecedented in history in their reckless, provocative and dangerous nature.\u201d In January Pyongyang told a United Nations disarmament conference: \u201cAs a responsible nuclear weapons state, we will continue to make efforts to prevent all forms of war and to protect peace and stability.\u201d Last month the regime insisted that its nuclear force is not \u201ca bargaining chip that can be exchanged for a mere sum of money.\u201d With Biden gone, America\u2019s foreign policy elite\u2014known as \u201cthe Blob\u201d\u2014fears that Trump will seek to revive his personal diplomacy with Kim. So do the South Koreans. Seoul\u2019s National Intelligence Service nervously predicted that Trump might unilaterally pursue an arms deal. If this proves to be the case, argued opposition legislator Park Sun-won, \u201cThe government needs to prevent any deals on North Korean nuclear weapons that exclude South Korea from happening.\u201d In mid-January, incoming Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth set off even more alarm bells when he called the DPRK a \u201cnuclear state\u201d and referred to its \u201cstatus as a nuclear power.\u201d Moreover, Trump observed that Kim \u201cis a nuclear state,\u201d apparently meaning the North Korean nation. The result was wailing and gnashing of teeth in both Washington and Seoul. The statements by Hegseth and Trump were true, but critics apparently feared that accurate terminology communicated acceptance of the North\u2019s status. A few decades ago, preventing a North Korean nuke was a reasonable objective. The DPRK was desperately poor and far from joining the nuclear club. Neither of its long-time patrons, the People\u2019s Republic of China and Soviet Union, wanted Pyongyang to possess nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended and the USSR collapsed, the North was left uniquely vulnerable to U.S. pressure, and therefore perhaps open to a deal. Policymakers hoped that Great Leader Kim Il-sung could be convinced to join the emerging global marketplace. However, that time is long past, and that world long gone. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, previously a hawk when it came to North Korea, admits that Kim Jong-un is not likely to surrender what he views as \u201chis insurance policy to stay in power.\u201d Nonproliferation always has been based on ostentatious shared hypocrisy. The major nuclear powers\u2014the U.S, USSR, PRC, United Kingdom, and France\u2014proclaimed that they had tasted sin, and therefore were determined to preserve their comfortable atomic oligopoly. Of course, the big five remained free to expand and improve their arsenals. Over the years three other states, Israel, India, and Pakistan, crashed the nuclear circle and were ultimately accommodated by the major powers. South Africa made a brief appearance with a minimal arsenal but abandoned its program with the end of the apartheid regime. Finally, North Korea broke through but faces resistance still. Its ultimate ambitions are unknown. However, a 2021 study by the Rand Corporation warned that within a few years \u201cNorth Korea could have 200 nuclear weapons and several dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and hundreds of theater missiles for delivering the nuclear weapons. The ROK and the United States are not prepared, and do not plan to be prepared, to deal with the coercive and warfighting leverage that these weapons would give North Korea.\u201d Expanding missile ranges to reach the U.S. would prove particularly dangerous for Americans. A second Korean War would be horrendous, and U.S. liability won\u2019t long remain limited to the Korean peninsula. Soon Pyongyang will possess the capability to destroy the American homeland. That is a price far too high to pay to protect the Republic of Korea, which, like Europe, is capable of defending itself. Kim may be within reach of creating such a deterrent to America, especially if Moscow offers some technical assistance in return for the DPRK\u2019s support in Ukraine. Thus, he has little incentive to sacrifice a capability so dearly bought and so nearly decisive. Possessing a few score, and perhaps hundred, nuclear weapons, globe-spanning missiles, and wide variety of delivery vehicles would turn the otherwise decrepit and marginal state into a Weltmacht, firmly lodged within the second rank of nuclear powers. What can the U.S. threaten or offer to achieve denuclearization? Not much. Pyongyang has survived years of sanctions. Despite a difficult relationship with the North, the PRC almost certainly will continue to emphasize stability over denuclearization on the peninsula. And today Moscow also guarantees the DPRK\u2019s survival. Even a revival of U.S.-Russian relations is unlikely to cause the Putin government to turn on North Korea, which has proved a useful ally. There also are carrots. In 2018 Trump spoke of the \u201cbrilliant potential\u201d for a modernized DPRK, playing up the prospects for economic development. For a time this possibility seemed to attract Kim, who promised his own people a better life. However, after the collapse in bilateral negotiations at the February 2019 Hanoi summit, Kim reversed course, dropping economic reforms, emphasizing military development, and further isolating his nation. This should surprise no one. It has become evident to all that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its agreements. Moscow went to war against Ukraine after the allies violated multiple assurances not to expand NATO to Russia\u2019s border. Ukraine and Libya were attacked after abandoning an inherited nuclear arsenal and a nascent nuclear program, respectively, in response to U.S. commitments. Indeed, Libya\u2019s Muammar Gadaffi was ousted and killed after relying on President George W. Bush\u2019s promises of goodwill. For any opponent of Washington, regime change could be only a short military campaign away. However, the North Korean leader, when he met Trump seven years ago, offered to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility in return for sanctions relief. His suspension of missile testing demonstrated that he would fulfill his commitments. This suggests the potential for further negotiation. Marco Rubio, at his confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, testified: \u201cI think there has to be an appetite for a very serious, broader North Korea policy,\u201d Thus, Trump\u2019s objective should be to cap and limit the DPRK\u2019s nuclear stockpile. This was the sort of arms control which the U.S. and Russia engaged in during the Cold War. Freezing the North Korean program alone would be a major victory. And Washington wouldn\u2019t have to stop there. It could build on success and continue to push for full denuclearization, however unlikely that might be. Such a negotiation could be stillborn, of course, but would have a better chance of success than doing nothing. Criticisms of this approach are many. One is that the North would cheat on any promised freeze. That argument proves too much. Pyongyang would be even more likely to cheat on full-blown denuclearization. If verification is impossible, why insist that Kim do what the U.S. will never be able to confirm and enforce? Another claim is that acknowledging Pyongyang\u2019s possession of nuclear weapons would undermine the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Actually, what threatens the NPT is the North Korean nuclear program, especially if it continues to advance in number and sophistication. The best way to limit the damage would be to restrain the North\u2019s efforts. If the international nuclear regime could survive Washington\u2019s acceptance of other nations as nuclear states, it could survive its acceptance of the North as well. Some critics contend that South Korea and Japan would be disturbed by any American retreat from denuclearization. For instance, the ROK foreign ministry responded to Hegseth\u2019s testimony: \u201cUnder the NPT (Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty), North Korea can never be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d The Korea Times worried that doing so would leave \u201cSouth Korea and its allies to confront the reality of a nuclear-armed North Korea.\u201d However, they face that today. What threatens the two is an increasingly powerful nuclear North, not Washington\u2019s recognition of that reality. In any case, the starting point to eliminate Pyongyang\u2019s nukes is limiting their number. Failing that, there is no chance of denuclearization. The Korea Times also feared that \u201cThis potential shift \u2026 could trigger a dangerous regional domino effect. If North Korea is recognized as a nuclear power, countries like South Korea, Japan and even Taiwan may reconsider their non-nuclear stances.\u201d Again, the challenge is the existence of the DPRK program, not recognition of the program\u2019s existence. Support for a South Korean program is strong because the North is a nuclear state, not because the U.S. recognizes it as such. (Moreover, there would be no better deterrent to Chinese aggressiveness than America\u2019s democratic allies going nuclear.) More credibly, America\u2019s allies might fear a U.S.-North Korean agreement that focused on limiting the DPRK\u2019s ability to hit America, which Victor Cha of CSIS calls \u201creally anathema when you look at it from a South Korean perspective.\u201d That, however, is a consequence of them choosing to rely on the U.S. government. Every American president has an obligation to put his own people\u2019s interests before those of other nations. Having seen Trump\u2019s treatment of Washington\u2019s European allies, Seoul and Tokyo should prepare to do a lot more to defend themselves. The only serious objection is that agreeing to arms control might preclude denuclearization. However, that seems unlikely. Kim is much more likely to freeze his program than end it. The administration could conceivably overpay for a freeze, reducing the incentives available to achieve denuclearization, but competent negotiation is necessary irrespective of the ultimate objective. The perfect desire of denuclearization should not be allowed to become the enemy of the achievable good of nuclear limitation. Hegseth is correct that North Korea is a nuclear state. Nevertheless, said National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes, \u201cPresident Trump will pursue the complete denuclearization of North Korea, just as he did in his first term.\u201d However, that doesn\u2019t preclude Trump from focusing on lesser but more achievable objectives first. Indeed, his personal diplomatic style makes that course likely. Although the president is currently focused on Ukraine, he should address North Korea soon. Kim is seeking to create a credible nuclear deterrent capable of ravaging the U.S. homeland. Thwarting that threat requires expeditious action and serious negotiation. This president, at least, realizes that he is responsible to the American people, not other governments, no matter how friendly. Doug Bandow is a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute.

        "title": "Starmer Will Walk Tightrope in Trump Meeting - The American Conservative",
        "text": "The prime minister may struggle to please both the American president and the British political class. When Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Washington this week and meets with President Donald Trump Thursday, he\u2019ll walk a tightrope between alienating the U.S. leader and causing himself political trouble at home. The prime minister has already drawn the ire of Trump, who recently said that Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron \u201chaven\u2019t done anything\u201d to end the Ukraine war. In response to Trump\u2019s comment, the British press went into a tailspin. Across the board, Britain\u2019s liberal media has expressed horror that Trump is looking to upend Ukraine policy, even though the three-year war is locked in a bloody stalemate. To understand the mood in Britain and its effect on Starmer\u2019s behavior, consider how he has responded to U.S. statements and actions the past few weeks. After Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO as part of a peace deal, Starmer declared that Kiev\u2019s path to entry to the Western alliance is irreversible. After Trump accused Ukrainian President Zelensky of being a dictator, Starmer disagreed, noting that Zelensky is a \u201cdemocratically elected leader.\u201d The UK abstained in the vote on a U.S.-backed Security Council resolution that called for an end to the war in Ukraine without criticizing Russia for the invasion. Starmer has also made critical comments about Trump in the past, as have members of his Labour party who now occupy positions of power in the government. Taking positions opposed to Trump doesn\u2019t augur well for Starmer\u2019s visit to Washington this week. Macron took a nuanced position during his meeting with the president, not fully aligning with the U.S., but showing a willingness to reach an agreement and to listen to Trump\u2019s point of view. Prime Minister Starmer may find nuance difficult to maintain. The pro-war lobby in the UK is both powerful and sufficiently delusional to expect Starmer to persuade Trump to reconsider America\u2019s diplomatic stance. A leading BBC commentator spoke of the risk of a \u201cgruesome sellout\u201d if Starmer goes along with Trump, rather than convincing the American president to take a hardline stance on Russia. John Simpson, the BBC\u2019s most seasoned world affairs editor, wrote a scathing article against Trump, calling him \u2018breathtakingly vain, and amazingly thin-skinned.\u2019 On their popular Political Currency podcast, Ed Balls, a Labour politician married to the current home secretary, accused Trump of spouting Russian propaganda. This echoes Zelensky\u2019s blunder last week, when he accused the president of living in a Russian disinformation space\u2014comments that prompted Trump to lash out against the Ukrainian leader. Corroborating Vice President J.D. Vance\u2019s criticism of free speech in Europe, almost no one in Britain\u2019s mainstream media or politics seems willing to suggest that White House officials, including Trump, may have a point. Even UK Reform Party leader Nigel Farage, a strongly pro-Trump politician, was cornered by the press into saying that Zelensky was not a dictator and that Ukraine should join NATO. 10 Downing Street has briefed the UK press that Starmer will try to \u2018\u201ctake the heat out\u201d of the debate on Ukraine by \u201cinjecting a sense of calm.\u201d But Starmer, in seeking to align American and British policy, will face significant challenges. Nowhere is the philosophical gulf between the two governments more evident than on the issue of what role Russia should play in securing a future peace deal. Trump sees engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin as vital to a breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Herein lies the basis of Trump\u2019s allegation that Starmer hasn\u2019t done enough to bring about peace. The UK has been implacably opposed to engagement with Putin on grounds that he alone is responsible for the conflict. This is a gulf that won\u2019t be bridged by elegant British weasel wording. Rather, Starmer would need to significantly revise Britain\u2019s approach not only to the Ukraine war but to Europe-Russian relations generally. I see no appetite in the UK for that. Across the British political spectrum, most people consider Putin the implacable enemy, Zelensky the unerring hero, and Trump a buffoon. Within Europe, Britain has taken the lead in seeking to isolate Russia diplomatically on the world stage. It authored this policy as far back as the second half of 2014, under the government of Prime Minister David Cameron. As I have pointed out in my memoir, not talking to Russia is a central tenet of British diplomacy. Keir Starmer didn\u2019t introduce this policy, and he may prove too constrained, or too cautious, to change it. And Ukraine will do everything it can to ensure the UK and Europe hold firm on isolating Russia, even as the U.S. aims to reengage. On a recent BBC news broadcast, an adviser to Zelensky complained that Trump was breaking Russia\u2019s diplomatic isolation by talking to Putin. This is becoming a major fault line between the U.S. and Europe, and Britain, perhaps more than any other country, has helped establish it. When Trump spoke on the phone to Putin, he smashed through the European consensus on Russia\u2019s isolation. Following what has been described as Trump\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Ukraine, some political figures have suggested raising UK taxes and boosting defence spending to three percent of GDP. The irony, of course, is that Trump has suggested European states do just that, as part of a move to managing their own security. On Tuesday, Starmer announced that Britain will increase defense spending from 2.3 percent to 2.5 by 2027 and to 2.6 by the following year. By whipping up a storm in Britain and Europe, Trump is advancing a core U.S. strategic goal of getting Europe to pay for its own security. In other words, the animosity Trump has stirred up among Europeans is actually helping him advance America\u2019s national interests. Still, that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that today the UK and the U.S. remain poles apart on policy. And the UK, which has contributed only about a tenth of American funding to Ukraine since the war started, has limited leverage to shift Trump\u2019s position. Starmer should follow Macron\u2019s lead and go to Washington ready to discuss with Trump how the UK can reengage politically with Russia in concert with U.S. efforts. There are small signs that the policy cogs in London are starting slowly to shift, with a senior Labor minister supporting Trump\u2019s engagement with Putin on the weekend. I hope Starmer is brave enough to repeat that line in Washington this week. If he does, he may succeed in pushing British politics toward a saner and more constructive position on Russia. Given the likely political blowback at home, however, I predict a fudge. Ian Proud was a senior officer at the British Embassy in Moscow from July 2014 to February 2019.

        "title": "Will Trump\u2019s Second Musk Bet Pay Off? - The American Conservative",
        "text": "DOGE could reform the government, or it could just aggravate voters. In the 2024 presidential campaign, one of the toughest matchups pitted entrepreneur Elon Musk and conservative activist Charlie Kirk against an established and experienced Democratic field operation. The Democrats had history and, based on recent elections, higher-propensity voters on their side. Their analytical prowess in other endeavors notwithstanding, the people getting out the vote for the GOP presidential ticket had never done it before at that level and were relying on people who voted less frequently. Musk (and Kirk) won. The Democratic smart set, some with national track records dating back to Barack Obama\u2019s two successful presidential campaigns, lost. Donald Trump returned to the White House with a clean sweep of the battleground states and, for the first time in three tries, a plurality of the national popular vote. Trump began his second term at the zenith of his political power. More than a month later, the polls are painting a mixed picture of whether that is still true. Overall, things generally look better than during the first term. But Trump is once again betting on Musk to deliver a big win where all the Democratic smart set says he has no chance. The Department of Government Efficiency could make or break the 47th president. On one level, DOGE is consistent with the larger Trump project. Democrats and their allies have for decades enjoyed asymmetric advantages in the permanent bureaucracy, media, and academia. Even the few Republican dissenters in these entities and institutions are disproportionately anti-Trump. Trump is committed to tearing down, or at least mitigating, all these advantages. But Trump, though still well to the right of most Democrats on economics even on purely Reaganite terms, has never really run as a government-cutter. Not even in Republican primaries against conservative competition like Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis. In fact, sometimes Trump\u2019s perceived unwillingness to shred the social safety net\u2014except insofar as it is being used as a hammock by the indolent or illegal immigrants\u2014has redounded to his electoral benefit. Trump carried voters making less than $50,000 a year, according to exit polls. That doesn\u2019t sound like a mandate for unbridled techno-libertarianism, even with Trump\u2019s mostly successful libertarian outreach. DOGE was a Trump campaign promise. But it now seems to loom larger in his governance than in his campaign, with the even richer billionaire Musk a less sympathetic face for austerity than the blue-collar-friendly president himself, in no small part due to attention from Trump\u2019s enemies in government, media, and academia (and the Tesla titan\u2019s erratic communications strategy). A dozen years ago, I wrote a book about the political prospects of limited government. I\u2019ve often since joked that it could have been a lot shorter based on today\u2019s political conditions. But $2 trillion in relative peacetime, post-pandemic annual deficit spending and a $36 trillion national debt test the truism that if something cannot go on forever, it will eventually stop. DOGE is doing some of the things I recommended back in those heady Tea Party days. It is highlighting wasteful spending, things that are inefficient or even just absurd, to showcase the problems of a swollen federal government. But that has to be a means to an end, not the full extent of a serious fiscal conservatism. The risk of DOGE is that it launches an indiscriminate attack on government, by people who don\u2019t fully understand what they are cutting, breaking things the voters want to work. This is especially acute under Trump, whose agenda requires the government to work effectively, at least in its core functions. If commercial flights had been grounded or worse repeatedly crashed after Ronald Reagan fired the air traffic controllers, his presidency would be remembered much differently today. Under the worst case scenario, the cuts are painful enough to elicit an electoral backlash but too small or poorly targeted to alter the country\u2019s basic fiscal trajectory, especially in conjunction with congressional Republican reconciliation efforts, ensuring that nobody ever tries this again before major entitlement programs\u2019 trust funds reach their breaking point. This also tests the Republicans\u2019 new, increasingly working-class coalition and to what degree can Trump and the party deliver tangible results for their new voters. Musk played a role in Trump\u2019s historic political comeback. Time will tell whether his DOGE mission and out-front persona can help produce further Trump victories. W.

        "title": "Congress Turns To Stopgap As GOP Tries To Spin Dems\u2019 Separation Of Powers Request As \u2018Unreasonable\u2019",
        "text": "With the March 14 deadline to fund the government looming, Republican leadership on Thursday began abandoning plans for a potential bipartisan spending deal, all while laying the rhetorical groundwork to try to blame Democrats \u2014 who are in the minority in the House and Senate \u2014 for a potential government shutdown. Democrats have been outspoken for weeks about the difficulties of negotiating a top-line dollar amount to keep the government open in the face of the Trump administration\u2019s rampage against the federal government, as Elon Musk and his DOGE pals freeze federal funds that have already been allocated by Congress. In order to avoid a shutdown, Congress would have to pass legislation \u2014 either a bipartisan spending bill (though the likelihood of that happening and happening in time to avert a shutdown is slim to none) or a continuing resolution, a stopgap bill to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year \u2014 soon. In recent days, Democrats in Congress began laying down their red line: in order to get their support on either plan, they\u2019d need some sort of guarantee that Trump and Musk will stop withholding congressionally approved funding and spend federal funds the way they were appropriated. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the Democrat demand is really simple,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told TPM, with a mocking emphasis on the word \u201cdemand\u201d on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s that the President commits to following the law. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d \u201cThe guardrails that we are asking for are really minimal. It\u2019s just: spend the money as we all appropriated,\u201d Coons, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, added during an elevator ride up to the Senate floor. Democrats are largely in agreement that their so-called demand \u2014 asking that the President follow the law and stop unilateral actions to freeze and claw back funding Congress has already approved \u2014 is the bare minimum. \u201cThe Republican silence and acquiescence in the face of a march down the road to autocracy and tyranny is absolutely unforgivable,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told TPM on Thursday. \u201cThat is what they are doing in effect. Looking the other way or putting the stamp of approval on the disregard for the law that the Trump administration is showing.\u201d \u201cWe should absolutely insist on safeguards to ensure that funds are spent the way they are appropriated,\u201d Blumenthal continued, adding that it should be a condition to helping the party that holds the majority in both chambers pass a spending bill. In the last two days, Republican leadership and top GOP appropriators began framing Democrats\u2019 request as outlandish. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) even claimed that the request would \u201climit the scope of executive authority\u201d and be \u201ca violation of separation of powers.\u201d \u201cOur differences with our Democratic colleagues on some of the restrictions they\u2019re demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority \u2014 we\u2019re not moving on that,\u201d House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-OK) said on Wednesday as he exited a meeting with Johnson, Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Politico reported. \u201cThe Democrats have had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this,\u201d Johnson claimed, describing Democrats\u2019 request for assurances around Congress\u2019 authority to stand up agencies and fund the federal government as \u201cjust unreasonable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Blaming Democrats, Johnson said on Wednesday that a six-month stopgap \u201cis becoming inevitable at this point.\u201d Collins told reporters on Thursday that she was asked to start working on a CR, rather than the 12-bill funding deal she\u2019s been working on, to avoid a possible shutdown. Democrats are pushing back against the rhetorical spin from their colleagues across the aisle, telling TPM they are simply asking the President to follow the law. Coons called Johnson\u2019s argument, that Democrats\u2019 request would be an intrusion on the executive branch, \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Coons asked, exasperated. \u201cFollow the law. I mean how complicated is that. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Senate Republicans will need at least seven Democrats to vote with them on a spending bill or a continuing resolution to keep the government open past the March 14 deadline. But GOP leadership\u2019s embrace of \u201clawlessness\u201d will make that nearly impossible, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) insinuated to TPM Thursday. \u201cSo they are a no go on asking the President and Elon Musk to follow the law,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) asked TPM pointedly as she made her way to a floor vote. The House is not much different when it comes to Democratic resistance to helping Republicans hand over the power of the purse to the executive branch. House Republicans hold a slim majority and the Speaker is trying to govern in a reality where a few far-right holdouts have the ability to tank any legislation at any given moment. \u201cIf Republicans have the votes, then they can call the shots. If they don\u2019t have the votes, then they\u2019re not in a position to call the shots,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told TPM Thursday morning outside the Capitol building. \u201cSo Mike Johnson needs to make a choice. If he has his caucus, then he can do what he wants. If he doesn\u2019t have his caucus, he can\u2019t do what he wants. And Democrats need to hold firm on that.\u201d Democrats stressed to TPM that the burden is on the President and congressional Republicans to avoid a shutdown. \u201cRepublicans have majorities in both the House and Senate. It\u2019s their responsibility to keep the government open,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), also a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told TPM matter-of-factly, during a conversation in the Senate basement. \u201cHope they accept that responsibility.\u201d When pushed on if the Democrats might get blamed for a shutdown, Durbin responded: \u201cWon\u2019t change the majority situation.\u201d Blumenthal said that Republicans need to meet Democrats where they are at if they want their help. \u201cRepublicans will be responsible if the government shuts down,\u201d Blumenthal told TPM. \u201cThey have the majority. They can\u2019t blame it on us. They\u2019re the dog that caught the bus.\u201d \u201cThey have a storyline,\u201d he added. \u201cDemocrats are to blame because they are in the majority. That\u2019s not the world anymore. I wish it were.\u201d With the March 14 deadline to fund the government looming, Republican leadership on Thursday began abandoning plans for a potential\u2026 This article first appeared at ProPublica.

        "text": "Creating criminal content with AI is a growing problem for law enforcement. Police in 20 countries have taken down a network that distributed images of child sexual abuse entirely generated by artificial intelligence. The operation \u2013 which spanned European countries including the United Kingdom as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand \u2013 is \"one of the first cases\" involving AI-generated images of child sexual abuse material, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol, which supported the action, said in a press release. Danish authorities led an operation, which resulted in 25 arrests, 33 house searches and 173 devices being seized. The crackdown came after a Danish man was arrested in November last year for producing and distributing AI-generated images of children being abused. He ran a platform users could access via a password after making an online payment. \"These artificially-generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge,\" said Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle. What's more, AI generators will boost the volume of child sexual abuse material, making it more \"challenging\" to identify offenders or victims, De Bolle said. Countries involved in the operation included Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Europol said there is currently \"a lack of national legislation\" on AI-generated child sexual abuse material. EU legislators are still in the process of negotiating a draft law to combat child sexual abuse material, presented by the European Commission in 2022. EU countries are struggling to come up with a common position. The ease of AI tools to produce material quickly is becoming a massive headache for law enforcement. Europol's chief AI officer warned in a recent interview with POLITICO that the rise of AI chatbots, powered by so-called generative AI models, had made it much easier for criminals to commit fraud. The agency will launch a campaign warning against using AI for illegal purposes in the coming days. Europe is facing a \u201cpower vacuum\u201d at a crucial time, new Defense Minister Theo Francken told POLITICO.

        "text": "Hollande didn\u2019t fault his successor Macron\u2019s attempts to woo Trump but expressed skepticism at the tactic\u2019s efficiency. PARIS \u2014 Former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said the United States government under President Donald Trump is \"no longer an ally.\" \"[Trump] is no longer an ally, he is consorting with our adversaries,\" Hollande, current President Emmanuel Macron's predecessor, said in a blunt interview with Le Monde published Friday. \"Even if the American people remain our friends, the Trump administration itself is no longer our ally.\" Hollande, who now sits in the French parliament as a member of the center-left Socialist Party, said Trump's decision to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" (which he walked back on Thursday); his plans to hold direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and the U.S. vote against a draft U.N. resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine all signal a potential \"divorce\" on the horizon between Europe and the United States. Though Hollande did not fault Macron, his former economy minister, for engaging with Trump during a trip to Washington earlier this week, he argued that the visit would've been more effective with other leaders alongside him and insisted that \"seduction and argumentation\" wouldn't work on the U.S. president. When asked if Macron's visit had yielded \"satisfying results,\" as Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot\u00a0claimed, Hollande responded: \"No, because I'm lucid.\" Hollande was president during the 2014 during the Russian annexation of Crimea, and, alongside former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, brokered the Minsk agreements between Russia and Ukraine. Those accords set up a cease-fire that failed to prevent Putin from launching his full-scale invasion three years ago. Hollande, 70, is often mentioned among potential candidates in the next French presidential election, which is scheduled for 2027. The French government is contemplating limiting the number of visas granted to Algerian citizens. How the government responds to Saturday\u2019s tragedy will have domestic and geopolitical ramifications.

        "text": "COP16 talks in Rome yielded agreement on funding nature restoration in poorer countries \u2014 but some details remain vague. ROME \u2014 In the second Trump era, it was about making a point: Yes, the world can still work together to fight environmental collapse. After three days of painful United Nations negotiations in Rome, world countries came to a delicate agreement late Thursday on boosting global finance for biodiversity that included plans to create a new fund for that purpose \u2014 something they had been stumbling on for years. It was not the emphatic funding deal many poorer nations had fought for. But the compromise proved countries could still bridge their differences and work together for the sake of preserving the planet, despite a fracturing world order and the dramatic retreat of the United States from international green diplomacy and foreign aid under President Donald Trump. Colombia\u2019s Environment Minister Susana Muhamad, who steered the talks as COP16 president, almost broke down in tears when the meeting came to a close on Friday morning, reflecting on the difficult road that had brought countries here. She said the deal was the \"light that still unites us in these dark times\" of a more \"fragmented and conflicted world.\" She praised a deal that provides the \u201clegs, arms and muscles\u201d to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. That deal,  agreed in 2022, sets goals to protect at least 30 percent of the earth\u2019s land and sea areas and increase financing for biodiversity to $200 billion annually by 2030. Scientists have long been warning about the dramatic consequences of biodiversity loss on food production and other economic activities, as well as on the need for urgent action to reverse the negative trend of 1 million species currently being threatened with extinction. Environmental groups broadly welcomed the outcome of COP16 \u2014 which needed a second round of talks in Rome after the first summit in Cali, Colombia, collapsed back in November \u2014 saying it provides clarity on the means to implement the Kunming-Montreal agreement. An Lambrechts, senior campaign strategist at Greenpeace International who was in Rome, said this is \u201ca helpful move in maintaining trust that the nature finance gap can be closed.\u201d But \u201cit's only one side of the coin, and we urgently need to see the other side too: money on the table,\u201d she warned and called on companies to chip in through the newly established Cali Fund and on rich countries to deliver on their commitment to provide $20 billion in public aid for biodiversity by the end of the year. But when the meeting came to a close in the early hours of Friday morning and Muhamad knocked the gavel one last time under the applause of the packed room to bring to a close the COP16, multiple negotiators praised the conclusions as a victory for multilateralism. \u201cAchieving common ground in turbulent times \u2026 this is what we achieved at COP16,\u201d said Canada\u2019s Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. A point that was echoed by many countries across the board, including from Latin America and small island developing states. \u201cAt first it wasn't certain\u201d that we would reach a deal, said Ousseynou Kass\u00e9, the representative of Senegal. \u201cBut the result we achieved shows the commitment of the parties involved to move toward multilateralism,\u201d he added, stressing \u201cwe must stay on this road.\u201d But Kass\u00e9 also pointed out that the difficult talks forced African countries, which had been pushing for the quick creation of a new global biodiversity fund for years, to make numerous concessions. \u201cThis is a compromise, and a compromise must be preserved, cultivated [over time],\u201d he warned and called to \u201cmobilize far more resources to protect biodiversity.\u201d This final text remains vague on the exact shape of this new financial mechanism and pushes back a final decision on its creation to 2028. The three-day meeting saw African and other developing countries, in particular small island states, go head-to-head with rich nations about the strategy to drastically increase funding going to biodiversity. European countries insisted on efforts to broaden potential sources, such as the private sector or the reform of environmentally harmful subsidies to finance conservation. But developing nations kept insisting on the creation of a new financial mechanism to ease access to the money, suggesting the existing Global Environment Facility isn\u2019t fully doing the job. Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, Norway\u2019s environment minister, explained that the question of a new fund was especially polarizing because \u201cbinary questions, especially in international negotiations, are always very tricky to work around.\u201d But he also told POLITICO that donor countries did acknowledged the \u201ccommon sense of urgency that we need to do something rapidly to ramp up financing to be able to meet the targets\u201d despite a more challenging economic environment. In recent years, \u201cwith the new security situation, higher interest rates, all of those make what we work with here more difficult,\u201d he said in the margins of the negotiations. The members of the BRICS group, composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, played a central role in driving the negotiations in the plenary room and behind closed doors. They also amplified demands of the African group, positioning themselves as clear allies. Brazil even put forward a proposal on the last day which would become the basis of the final compromise. A Latin American negotiator recalled that the talks had become \u201cfrustrating\u201d with the first compromise from the Colombian presidency tilting \u201ctoo much\u201d toward the position of rich countries, but the Brazilian proposal would contribute to rebalancing this. The U.S., which never ratified the treaty, was not involved in negotiations, and not even present in the room as observer. In the end, an EU official said the European Union was still \"very satisfied\" with the deal struck, as it prevented the creation of a new fund right away \u2014 which was a red line. They also said the positive outcome was made possible thanks to a close dialogue with the BRICS countries. \u201cFighting for your own interest, that\u2019s normal, legitimate,\u201d the EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, but noted that \u201call sides made compromises\u201d and that the debates weren\u2019t necessarily driven by \u201cideological\u201d postures. \u201cEverybody played its part.\u201d The EU also obtained that countries further discuss \u201copportunities for broadening the contributors base\u201d when considering future financial instruments. \u201cI\u2019m relieved also about the positive signal that this [deal at COP16] sends to other ongoing negotiations on climate change and plastics that we have,\u201d the EU official said. Norway\u2019s Eriksen also told POLITICO that Friday's agreement \u201cwon't necessarily make the negotiations [on climate and plastic pollution] themselves easier, but I think the mindset of which parties enter those other negotiations will perhaps be a bit easier or even more constructive.\u201d Rich and poor countries are battling over who will fund nature conservation in the shadow of a radically anti-green U.S. administration. The Court of Justice of the EU will now look at the case and rule in a few months. Attacks against LGBTQ+ people are becoming \u201cthe testing ground for laws that erode democracy itself,\u201d NGO\u2019s executive director says. Intentionally or not, concerned businesses, the ascendant far right and traditional conservatives are coming together to rewrite green rules.",

        "text": "Inside the months of quiet, grinding preparation that went into the British prime minister\u2019s all-smiles first trip to the Trump White House \u2014 and why it could all still unravel. AI generated Text-to-speech WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cThese visits are like a first date,\u201d said one senior U.K. official, as they nervously awaited Keir Starmer\u2019s first White House talks with Donald Trump. \u201cYou go and just hope you might get married someday.\u201d Not yet \u2014 but the U.K. prime minister and U.S. president could\u2019ve had people fooled. The sidelong smiles and gold curtains; even aides split into his-and-his blocks at their press conference. Vice President JD Vance sat across the aisle from Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Trump praised Starmer\u2019s \u201cbeautiful accent\u201d and dangled the prospect of \u201cvery good\u201d trade deal. Starmer literally spoke Trump\u2019s language, saying of his second U.K. state visit: \u201cThis has never happened before. It's so incredible. It will be historic.\u201d The deeply private PM even managed a laugh when the president, unprompted, lavished praise on his \u201cbeautiful, great\u201d wife. Beyond the bromance, however, Trump left many crucial unanswered questions \u2014 not least whether the U.S. will give the concrete security guarantees Britain wants for a postwar Ukraine, beyond having U.S. workers there as part of a minerals deal. These would be refocusing Friday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House to sign that deal. They will again on Sunday when Starmer convenes European leaders including Zelenskyy in London. Yet the bonhomie was never guaranteed from the unpredictable Trump, whose allies including Elon Musk have deep misgivings about center-left lawyer Starmer. It may unravel, but is being seen \u2014 for now \u2014 as a PR victory in No. 10. Starmer and his aides were smiling on the red-eye flight home; the undemonstrative PM even managed a thumbs-up. POLITICO spoke to half a dozen U.K. government officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters. They gave a picture of months of quiet, grinding preparation, designed to ensure that Starmer \u2014 struggling in the polls against Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK \u2014 did not become another victim of a White House humiliation. In a sense, the preparations began about a year ago, when Lammy \u2014 then shadow foreign secretary with decades of personal ties with Democrats \u2014 took it upon himself to reach out across the aisle to Republicans. He met Vance, and told friends he believed the then-Ohio senator may become Trump\u2019s running mate. Lammy studied the example of the late Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister who managed to get pally with Trump in his first term and also achieve a trade deal. But many of the hard yards were done by the British embassy in Washington under recently departed Ambassador Karen Pierce. Senay Bulbul, a political counsellor at the embassy, built close links to MAGA Republicans and was present for the White House meetings on Thursday. Apolitical Pierce left a month ago, replaced by the smooth-talking Peter Mandelson, a former minister under Labour ex-PM Tony Blair. He was an unlikely choice given his Europhile tendencies and calls for more engagement with China. If there was disquiet among the Republicans sipping sparkling ros\u00e9 under the crystal chandeliers at Mandelson\u2019s lavish residence Wednesday, they kept it to themselves. Guests swarmed around him at the reception. Starmer earned a laugh by describing Mandelson as the man some people \u201clove to hate.\u201d Mandelson introduced the PM to new FBI Director Kash Patel, who has railed against the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Patel joked about bringing his family to visit and having them put up in the embassy. More fundamental was the cultural divide between Trump acolytes and Starmer\u2019s aides. The PM\u2019s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney attended the Democratic National Convention last summer and set up the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which is now in a long and bitter battle with Musk. As if to atone, McSweeney \u2014 a ruthless campaign strategist who has targeted many of the same blue-collar voters as Trump \u2014 visited Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles in December. Their talks were secret, but the message seemed clear in Thursday\u2019s press conference, after a lunch where McSweeney was at the table. Trump flashed a satisfied smile as Starmer said: \u201cIt's no secret we're from different political traditions, but there's a lot that we have in common. We believe it's not taking part that counts. What counts is winning.\u201d The countdown began in earnest around two weeks ago, when Downing Street \u2014 after some weeks of trying \u2014 was given a provisional date for Starmer\u2019s visit. Some of Starmer\u2019s most senior aides visited Washington, in the run-up to lay the ground. They included his Director of Communications Matthew Doyle, who visited last week. Foreign Secretary Lammy then landed on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Lammy held a 45-minute meeting in the State Department with Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine. He and aides established that the U.S. red line was having American troops on the ground in Ukraine \u2014 so Britain made a concerted effort to stress it was never what it had wanted. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s got anybody\u201d was tapping up U.S. contacts, a second U.K. official said. Their goal was to listen; to work out what the White House wanted, rather than pressing Starmer\u2019s view. It wasn\u2019t always easy. \u201cA lot of them wake up in the morning just waiting for what [Trump] is going to say today,\u201d said the first official quoted above. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to read anything that\u2019s going on at the top of the administration unless you have a top line to the president,\u201d added the second official. \u201cSo there\u2019s no point us pushing \u2014 we can articulate our argument, underline our position, but we were never going to be going into meetings with demands or pressure.\u201d A third U.K. official said the final flurry of pre-meetings was \u201cdriven by the prime minister.\u201d They added: \u201cHe has been focused on this since we got the date confirmed. [It is] the sort of attention to detail in the planning that you would associate with him and which meant he could make the most of the visit.\u201d Starmer woke on the day of the meeting to U.S. newspapers that had relegated his presence to small stories in the foreign section. A mooted morning meeting with members of Congress was left on the shelf, after they became bogged down in U.S. domestic politics. But that gave the PM \u2014 a meticulous preparer who used to watch back his own answers in the Commons and hit pause for notes \u2014 more time to swot up. He left Blair House opposite the White House and went to the British Embassy, where he spent more than three hours in briefings, including in a secure room. There he downloaded the thinking of aides and Lammy on what the U.S. had been saying. Part of the display at the White House was a careful act. Process-obsessed lawyer Starmer is not given to hyperbole, yet leaned into it to describe Trump\u2019s state visit. He detests theatrics, yet whipped a letter from King Charles III \u2014 inviting Trump to that state visit \u2014 out of his jacket pocket. He does not go in for back-slapping bonhomie, yet put his hand on the president\u2019s arm. Officials had strongly suggested he would not mirror the bromance approach of French President Emmanuel Macron, who swept in with a date before Starmer\u2019s on Monday and repeatedly touched Trump, because it was not his style. In the end, that was exactly what Starmer did. Unlike many European counterparts, the watchword of Starmer\u2019s entire approach to Trump has been: you catch more with honey. Just days before the visit, Starmer announced a hike in Britain\u2019s defense spending \u2014 by cutting the overseas aid budget \u2014 with timing that seemed explicitly designed to appeal to Trump\u2019s demand for Europe to step up. One minister said Britain was being \u201cas amenable as we possibly can\u201d in the name of pragmatism, given so much of Britain\u2019s economic and national security is intertwined with the U.S. They added: \u201cNobody wants to say anything that\u2019s going to embarrass him or be used against us collectively.\u201d As a backlash mounted over Trump\u2019s comments on Ukraine, including failing to blame Russia for the war, there was some fear in Whitehall that the president wouldn\u2019t even take part in Monday\u2019s call of G7 leaders. There was cause for optimism, though. Officials were noting that some of the most extreme comments by Trump allies \u2014 such as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth casting doubt on the role of NATO \u2014 were not matched by comments they had made later or in private. Yet despite Starmer and Lammy enjoying a two-hour chicken dinner with Trump in September, there were genuine worries that the PM would end up being belittled like leaders before him. \u201cWe needed to make sure we were coming with a unified message,\u201d the second official quoted above said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be Angela Merkel, do you, or indeed Theresa May?\u201d There is still time for Starmer to become either of them. He left the White House under dark clouds \u2014 literally \u2014 and unanswered questions. Aides later clarified that despite Trump speaking of a trade deal, they were not prioritizing a full-fat free-trade agreement, long coveted in London after Brexit. Starmer, on the flight to Washington, warned Russian President Vladimir Putin could \u201ccome again\u201d for Ukraine if there is an insufficient backstop. When he met Trump, the president said he believed Putin would keep his word. Starmer also nudged back at Trump\u2019s suggestion that by striking a minerals deal with Ukraine, he was \u2014 by default \u2014 providing a security guarantee for European peacekeeping troops in future. Starmer had been pushing for U.S. aerial intelligence, and air cover should Russia attack. In an interview with NBC after his White House visit, Starmer said he could \u201csee the value\u201d in Trump\u2019s approach to minerals \u2014 but it would form merely \u201cat least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d At talks with European leaders on Sunday, he will want more. All this is linked to the fundamental question of a United States that is moving its eye away from Europe, regardless of how friendly Trump decides to be. John Spellar, a Labour peer and former defense minister under Tony Blair, said the U.S. has said \u201cfor ages\u201d that its focus is moving away and \u201cEurope has unfortunately not taken this seriously.\u201d He added: \u201cThe U.S., as it shifts its focus to the Pacific, has made clear it cannot be Europe\u2019s first responder. And by the way, this would be inevitable under an administration from either party.\u201d Starmer will be celebrating this meeting as a successful one. But as they say; you\u2019re only as good as your last meeting. Trump lauded Britain\u2019s leader but gave little ground, a day ahead of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. president suggested he was \u201cinclined to go along\u201d with the deal which hands the archipelago to Mauritius. U.S. president tells POLITICO: \u201cI think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Britain and France want guarantees that Washington will back up a peacekeeping force after the war.",

        "text": "Farmers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia join Czech-led demonstrations, rejecting Ukraine\u2019s efforts to ease concerns over cheap imports. AI generated Text-to-speech BRUSSELS \u2014\u00a0Farmers in the Czech Republic spearheaded a new wave of protests against EU trade policy on Thursday, rallying at border crossings and driving tractors onto roads in a show of defiance against agricultural imports from Ukraine and South America. Demonstrators from Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia joined in solidarity, amplifying demands for stricter controls on foreign goods. \u201cThe association agreement with Ukraine will increase the volume of cheap, lower-quality grain and oilseeds on the European market,\u201d said Martin P\u00fdcha, head of the Czech Agrarian Chamber, referring to a looming update to the European Union\u2019s trade deal with Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019re not against trade with Ukraine, but any deal must be made on a fair basis.\u201d For South American exporters, a few blockades on Czech roads hardly register. For Ukraine, on the other hand, the stakes are much higher. With its emergency trade access to the EU set to expire in June, Kyiv is rushing to reassure its Eastern European neighbors that its agricultural exports won\u2019t flood their markets \u2014 and that its hopes of deeper European integration remain intact. Their anxiety stems from the massive influx of Ukrainian grain into Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania in 2022 and early 2023, when Russia\u2019s naval blockade cut off Black Sea shipping routes and forced exports onto overland corridors. With limited capacity to process or reexport these goods, border countries saw stockpiles build up, triggering unilateral bans from Poland, Hungary and Slovakia as well as EU-wide emergency measures. Now that commercial traffic has largely resumed in the Black Sea, Ukrainian grain is flowing to Spain \u2014 the EU\u2019s top buyer \u2014 with only marginal volumes going to markets in the east of the bloc. Still, Kyiv isn\u2019t taking any chances. To prove it can handle any export surge responsibly following the EU trade deal update, the government has set up self-imposed export licenses and quotas for staple goods. The measures aim to reassure its anxious neighbors that Ukraine won\u2019t flood nearby countries with cheap agricultural products. So far, that pledge hasn\u2019t won over everyone in the region. The Hungarian government, alongside Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, is pushing Brussels to reintroduce the tighter prewar quotas that once restricted Ukrainian exports. Hungarian Agriculture Minister Istv\u00e1n Nagy has argued that even the current reduced volumes risk overwhelming domestic producers. \u201cWe want to return to normality \u2014 to the prewar agreements,\u201d Nagy said on Facebook. \u201cThis market opening, this EU-Ukraine trade deal, has completely destroyed the internal market. In both volume and quality, it represents a completely different category: It\u2019s cheap, and it has crushed prices, making it impossible for European farmers to compete.\u201d Such a rollback would be devastating for Ukraine\u2019s struggling economy. Domestic farm groups warn that ending duty-free access to the EU could cost the country billions of euros in output, government revenues and worker salaries. Ukrainian agricultural economist Oleg Nivievskyi is among those who question the Hungarian fears, arguing that trade data contradicts Budapest's claims of depressed EU farm prices. \u201cLook at sugar \u2014 our exports helped stabilize EU markets during a bad harvest,\u201d Nivievskyi said. \u201cWithout them, prices would have skyrocketed.\u201d He said the same of other commodities, calling Ukrainian exports a buffer that keeps supply chains stable and food prices lower across the EU, and adding that Europe\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy is a bigger threat to the bloc\u2019s competitiveness than Ukrainian imports. \u201cI don\u2019t think Ukrainian exports are destroying the EU farming sector,\u201d Nivievskyi said. \u201cIt\u2019s the CAP that undermines competitiveness. What we have right now in EU farming \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t call it communism, but it\u2019s definitely central planning.\u201d The timing of the dispute is critical. The EU\u2019s temporary Autonomous Trade Measures allowing Ukrainian goods to enter the bloc duty-free expire in June, and the Commission faces a tricky balancing act: How to back Ukraine\u2019s war-battered economy without inciting political backlash in eastern member countries already jittery over cheap imports. The situation is further complicated by shifting policy in Washington, where President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to push for an end to the war on terms that could include Ukraine's ceding territory to Russia. The U.S. stance has amplified concerns in Kyiv about retaining solid access to the EU market, with Ukraine officials warning that losing trade privileges would undermine the country\u2019s fragile economic recovery and hurt its goal of joining the EU. Nivievskyi also fears the debate could damage Ukraine\u2019s accession talks. \u201cI hope the European Commission acts as a good moderator in this process because it has to balance different voices from member states and convert them into policy. But it\u2019s clear that some governments will use trade disputes as leverage.\u201d For now, Brussels seems undeterred. European Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, visiting Kyiv this week, promised a \u201csmooth transition\u201d once the ATMs end. \u201cWe remain fully committed to swift implementation of mutual trade liberalization,\u201d he told the Interfax agency. \u201cAs you know, this will be a very delicate task for us, given the sensitivity of certain products to the markets of our member countries and, of course, the concerns of our farmers.\u201dThis story has been updated with actuality on Thursday\u2019s protests. Brussels threatens to use its trade bazooka after President Donald Trump says the European Union was created to \u201cscrew\u201d America. There are insuperable market, phytosanitary and political obstacles \u2014\u00a0and it could get worse. With Ukraine\u2019s privileged access to the EU market expiring soon, Kyiv pleads for clarity \u2014 while Brussels hesitates and Washington\u2019s backing disintegrates. EU tries to make farming sexy again \u2014 and keep farmers from revolting.",

Politics State Politics Western Australia Share The\u00a0one and only debate\u00a0between the leaders of\u00a0Western Australia\u2019s\u00a0major parties (although calling the WA Liberals \u201cmajor\u201d at the moment feels\u00a0a touch generous)\u00a0was\u00a0a dispiriting affair. Both leaders \u2014\u00a0current Labor Premier Roger Cook and Liberal contender Libby Mettam \u2014 spoke\u00a0haltingly, tripping over their words and clearly looking down at their notes. There was an understandable focus on cost of living, health and housing, with Cook and Mettam barreling past any difficult questions to nestle comfortably in their talking points. But, as ever, what wasn\u2019t discussed was every bit as revealing (and given the largely insubstantial answers, probably more revealing) as what was. At no point did the topic of mitigating the environmental impact of WA\u2019s mineral wealth come up. As with the Tasmanian election and the bipartisan silence on gambling influence, this is what state capture looks like. This week Cook has airily invited any teal independents reelected in 2025 to \u201cgo to the Pilbara, see where their standard of living is actually based, and see where the economy is being driven\u201d. It\u2019s widely agreed that the Liberal Party, recovering from the worst defeat in its history back in 2021, has absolutely no chance of winning on March 8. But even if by some miracle it did, the following areas would stay more or less the same. See if they give you any clue as to who really runs the show in WA. There was some minor needling of Mettam during the debate for her craven support of Peter Dutton\u2019s gratuitous refusal to speak in front of the Indigenous flag. But symbolic gestures aside, the parties differences in this area aren\u2019t completely irreconcilable. Cook\u2019s backflip on Indigenous cultural heritage laws in 2023 was done with bipartisan approval. The laws were introduced under Cook\u2019s predecessor Mark McGowan after mining giant Rio Tinto destroyed nearly 50,000 years of irreplaceable Indigenous heritage at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region. The laws were in operation for less than a month before outcry from farmers and what the AFR called \u201cbehind-closed-door lobbying by the resources industry\u201d saw them entirely scrapped, on account of (according to Cook) the impositions they placed on \u201ceveryday WA property owners\u201d. Mettam welcomed the capitulation, which the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge called a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Meanwhile, in the last days of 2024, it was revealed that the WA government was pushing for changes to the Native Title Act to provide greater protection to miners. We have Cook\u2019s personal lobbying on behalf of the resource sector to thank for the collapse of the federal government\u2019s promise to implement a federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Of course, WA Labor\u2019s Ghostbuster\u2019s-like contempt for the EPA extends to the state\u2019s own version. This week, reporting by Rhiannon Shine in the ABC detailed the just-released WA EPA report on the state\u2019s environmental approval systems, that the government had attempted to keep from public view for over a year. The report, commissioned in response to complaints from the state\u2019s Chamber of Commerce and Industry regarding waiting times for environmental approval, was conducted over six weeks and did not, apparently, speak to a single conservation group among its interviews with \u201cpeak bodies, industry proponents, key stakeholders and state and commonwealth government agencies and departments\u201d. In 2023 previous EPA head Dr Tom Hatton made the \u201cextraordinary\u201d claim that in 2019 McGowan personally intervened to ask him to withdraw the agency\u2019s proposed emissions guidelines. \u201cHe made it very clear that he didn\u2019t feel that consultation was sufficient within industry, and he asked us to withdraw the guidelines,\u201d Hatton recalled. \u201cI tried to have a conversation to say \u2026 we are happy to do further consultation if that\u2019s what\u2019s required. He said,\u00a0\u2018no, I want you to withdraw the guidelines\u2019.\u201d An unrelated detail which just popped in my mind, for some reason: upon his resignation from politics, McGowan swiftly took jobs at BHP and Mineral Resources, while a few years earlier, his treasurer and Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt took a gig with Rio Tinto. Meanwhile, late last year, Labor legislation aimed at\u00a0reducing emissions\u00a0was quietly shelved. In case the monolithic approach to the environment makes our WA readers so angry they wish to take to the streets, we have more bad news. Turns out the government isn\u2019t simply an advocate for the fossil fuel industry \u2014 it\u2019s also a private security service for it. In recent years there\u00a0have been a series of raids and arrests\u00a0by WA\u2019s counterterrorism police\u00a0aimed at climate-related protestors. In August 2023, three people were arrested by the Western Australian Police Force\u2019s state security investigation group for the planned graffitiing of the home of Woodside CEO Meg O\u2019Neill. Two people were arrested for the \u201cstink-bombing\u201d of Woodside\u2019s annual general meeting\u00a0that April, and there was an\u00a0armed raid on the home\u00a0of climate\u00a0activist Joana Partyka\u00a0after she had spray-painted the Woodside logo on a Frederick McCubbin painting at the Art Gallery of Western Australia. Two years earlier, six members of Extinction Rebellion were arrested for covering a pedestrian footbridge near Woodside\u2019s Perth headquarters with slogans. The slogans had been\u00a0written in chalk that could be washed off. Have something to say about this article? Write to us at letters@crikey.com.au.

Politics News Share Tourism Australia has \u201cacknowledged\u201d its mistakes and promised to ensure its future spending will be \u201ccompliant and clearly demonstrate value for money\u201d after an audit report found 70% of its procurement didn\u2019t feature open competition. At a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday night, managing director Phillipa Harrison also confirmed an Australian Federal Police investigation into a former senior staff member is still ongoing. That probe was opened after Tourism Australia made a police referral about a trio of employees who had gone on public holidays using taxpayer money.\u00a0As first revealed by Crikey last year, Tourism Australia fired a senior employee and two of their China-based colleagues last year for blowing $137,441 of taxpayer money on the trips. The money was later paid back. Tourism Australia fronted estimates two months after a damning Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report revealed systematic flaws in the agency\u2019s procurement processes, involving contracts totalling $370 million. The ANAO found Tourism Australia neither complied with Commonwealth procurement rules nor demonstrated it achieved value for money as it spent hundreds of millions of dollars. The agency even failed to keep records demonstrating how it procured the services of its own probity advisor, according to the audit. At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Nationals Senator Ross Cadell spent just nine minutes asking questions about the audit. No other senators, including anyone from the Greens or crossbench, showed up to ask questions. Asked about the audit, Harrison asked to read from a prepared statement, in which she \u201cacknowledged the shortcomings\u201d identified by the ANAO, and added Tourism Australia had accepted all recommendations and was now \u201cfully committed\u201d to implementing new processes, policies and training to improve procurement practices. Those efforts included hiring the services of consultancy Yardstick Advisory, whose director Sam Skelton will be reporting to the Tourism Australia board every month. Still, at another point in the hearing, Harrison also defended her agency\u2019s existing processes. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a fairly stringent procurement policy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think where we let ourselves down is we just didn\u2019t have a strong enough contract management system that had gates that sort of guided staff through that process. So, you know, there\u2019s always really good intent around managing our procurement. I think we just didn\u2019t have the system there.\u201d Harrison said Mark Craig, the agency\u2019s executive general manager for corporate services, retired in January for personal health reasons, and that while there was an acting executive in the role, the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d for overseeing procurement and contract management services sat with her. She acknowledged that Tourism Australia\u2019s website still listing Craig as active in the role was an \u201coversight\u201d that would be rectified. There were no questions about the AFP\u2019s investigation into the agency, although Harrison answered \u201cyes\u201d when Cadell suggested the investigation was ongoing.

Health News Politics Technology Share The federal government investments fund says it is \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its decision to pour tens of millions of dollars into controversial Australian artificial intelligence health company harrison.ai.\u00a0However, it wouldn\u2019t confirm if it considered the privacy commissioner\u2019s probe into the source of the sensitive patient data used to train the startup\u2019s AI. On Thursday afternoon, the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) \u2014 a $15 billion government-owned business \u2014 appeared before Senate estimates, where, as first reported by\u00a0InnovationAus, it was grilled over its\u00a0$32 million investment\u00a0into\u00a0harrison.ai. The investment, made in late January, followed Crikey\u2019s investigations into harrison.ai\u2019s acquisition of hundreds of thousands of chest X-rays of Australian patients from the country\u2019s biggest pathology provider, I-MED. Harrison.ai used the X-rays to train its AI without patients\u2019 knowledge or express consent. I-MED is also an investor in harrison.ai. Crikey\u2019s investigations \u2014 which also uncovered how this data included chest X-rays from the public healthcare system and from patients in emergency situations who could not consent to their scans being used \u2014\u00a0prompted inquiries from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner into I-MED. Harrison.ai has defended itself, saying it has abided by Australian laws and regulations and that how I-MED has handled this matter is outside its purview. At estimates, Greens Senator David Shoebridge, the party\u2019s digital rights spokesperson, questioned how the NRFC investigated the potential risks associated with its harrison.ai investment. NRFC chief investment officer Dr Mary Manning said the corporation had considered concerns raised in these investigations before deciding to invest in harrison.ai, a decision made \u201cshortly\u201d before it was officially announced on January 29. \u201cWe did look at ESG [environmental, social and governance] \u2026 including data privacy and patient data and we are comfortable,\u201d she said. However, despite repeated questions, Manning would not directly confirm whether the NRFC\u2019s board was briefed on the privacy probe into I-MED and how the pathology company had collected the data to hand over to harrison.ai. It\u2019s unclear whether the board knew about the probe when making the investment, just one of its seven so far. The NRFC\u2019s CEO David Gall, whose appointment was announced the day before the $32 million investment in harrison.ai, told estimates that due diligence on the AI health company and the decision to invest was made \u201cbefore his time\u201d. Gall said he was unaware of the privacy commissioner probe and was committed to \u201creview\u201d the decision. He also said the NRFC had an ongoing role in managing investments in companies. The NRFC also took a question on notice about harrison.ai\u2019s use of Stanford data to train its models that are listed as for non-commercial use only. The federal government\u2019s investment was part of harrison.ai\u2019s $170 million fundraising round, its third so far. Minister of Industry and Science Ed Husic welcomed the investment: \u201cThis is what we want to see more of \u2014 brilliant Aussie know-how creating thriving world-beating businesses,\u201d he said at the time.

Crikey Worm Share As we close out another week where the federal election has yet to be called, the green-thumbed among Crikey\u2019s\u00a0readers may have noticed the sheer amount of dirt being flung in and around Parliament House \u2014 a sure sign that, announced or not, the election campaign is underway. The SMH reckons Labor\u2019s \u201cdirt unit\u201d stumbled this week by revealing that the Prime Minister\u2019s Office was behind the story about Peter Dutton\u2019s share trades during the GFC. Dutton bought shares in Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac in the days leading up to a Rudd government stimulus package widely seen as a \u201cbailout\u201d for the big banks. \u201cThe Albanese government is not the first to throw mud at an opposition during a federal election campaign and hope it sticks, although usually they seek to keep fingerprints off the final product,\u201d the SMH writes in its explainer on dirt or \u201cresearch\u201d units. The ABC\u2019s Brett Worthington said that in Parliament House this week, a \u201ctip truck \u2026 could be heard reversing with a load full of dirt, conveniently dumped on the doors of the press gallery\u201d. He points out that while Anthony Albanese was personally trying to keep his hands clean, there was no shortage of ministers scrambling to keep Dutton in the news for the wrong reasons. Dutton has denied any wrongdoing, and while he has said the Coalition won\u2019t be prying into Anthony Albanese\u2019s own investments (sure), he took a quick snipe at the prime minister regarding his rags-to-riches narrative. \u201cHe tells a story of growing up in housing commission, and he\u2019s now a multi-millionaire with property. Good luck to him.\u201d At the end of the day, does anyone really mind if a story is dug out by an unsavoury dirt unit or not? Not really, says John MacGowan, a former Liberal Party dirt unit staffer, now private consultant: \u201cNo-one cares where the story comes from, as long as it stands up as true,\u201d he says. In actual news, third party groups are assembling in an attempt to undermine the Greens and teal independents, according to reporting from Guardian Australia. A group calling itself \u201cBetter Australia\u201d says it is an \u201cindependent grassroots initiative formed in response to widespread concerns from Australians of all walks of life\u201d. A draft flyer for the group seen by The Guardian\u00a0(which the group says is \u201coutdated\u201d, though it didn\u2019t provide an updated version) says Better Australia has two objectives for the 2025 federal election: Target Green and teal seats, and end Green and teal growth. It comes as reporting from the ABC confirms that most of the current crossbench (19 members, the largest in Australian history) say they \u201cwon\u2019t strike formal agreements and instead will force Labor or the Coalition to deal with them bill by bill\u201d should they be reelected. \u201cA series of polls in recent months has indicated neither Labor nor the Coalition would win a majority of seats if an election was held today, which would force them to turn to the crossbench to find support to form government. \u201cIt means the power to decide who runs the country could end up in the hands of a few key MPs \u2014 and those independents by and large want to reserve the right to withdraw their support (though most specified stable government would also be a priority for them).\u201d The Greens, teals and other independents will surely be preparing for an interesting few weeks as people on all sides of politics alternatingly pander to, and undermine, them based on how likely they are to be reelected. What fun. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u00a0has visited Donald Trump in Washington, with the president calling Starmer \u201ca special man\u201d (what an honour). According to The Australian, Starmer has \u201cpleaded\u201d with Trump for air support and surveillance to aid peacekeepers planning to be deployed by Britain and France should the conflict in Ukraine come to an end. \u201cThe security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin \u2026 If there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again, because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious,\u201d Starmer told reporters while en route to Washington. During the meeting, Starmer gave Trump a letter from King Charles III, to which Trump asked: \u201cAm I supposed to read it right now?\u201d The two discussed the war in Ukraine, trade sanctions against the EU, and the UK\u2019s plans to return sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. At the risk of falling into the trap of reporting what Trump says not what he does, it\u2019s difficult to avoid the obvious trend of Trump outright saying that he never said things that he is very much on the record as saying (you know, lying). During questions from the press, Trump refuted ever calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d, saying \u201cDid I say that? I can\u2019t believe I said that. Next question.\u201d He also denied ever saying that the EU was designed to \u201cscrew\u201d the US on trade. He said that yesterday. Anyway, the meeting appears to have been mostly cordial, with Trump clearly having a harder time criticising someone to their face compared to when they\u2019re thousands of kilometres away. The BBC reports that regardless, Trump clearly wanted to be \u201cin charge\u201d, with Starmer struggling to get a word in edgewise. \u201cHe also occasionally makes light-hearted jabs at the reporters in the room \u2014 and at Starmer and the UK as a whole. \u201c\u2018Can you take on Russia by yourself?\u2019 he asked, to which Starmer only laughed. Meanwhile, Starmer was leaning back in his chair, legs crossed and only occasionally interjecting,\u201d the BBC writes. The UK PM appears to have had two major moments of interjection (with BBC noting similarities between the moments and French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s live fact-check of Trump earlier in the week): First, Starmer pushed back on JD Vance\u2019s assertion that freedom of speech had been \u201cinfringed upon\u201d in Britain, saying he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of free speech protections in the UK. Second, he corrected Trump when the president said that European countries were being paid back all of the money they had given Ukraine, saying \u201cWe\u2019re not getting all of ours. I mean, quite a bit of ours was gifted. It was given. There were some loans, but mainly it was gifted actually.\u201d Hopefully that air of generosity rubs off on Donald. Somehow, I doubt it. Among the various unsavoury accusations levelled at our good friends across the pond, there is one fact about New Zealanders that has never been in contention: they know how to handle sheep. Alexia Phillips of Waikato, North Island (go Chiefs) broke the women\u2019s shearing world record last week, shaving a frankly insane 367 ewes in eight hours (an average of one every 80 seconds), beating the previous record of 358. The event, which took place 200km southeast of Perth, was held in slightly \u201ccooler than ideal\u201d conditions (surely a blessing, if you ask me), taking roughly \u201cdouble the time it takes to run a marathon\u201d. Phillips\u2019 training regimen apparently involved her undergoing CrossFit training\u00a0after a full day of her usual shearing responsibilities. Her mother Marlene pointed out to the potentially uninitiated ABC reporters that it\u2019s important to be \u201cshearing fit\u201d, not just regular fit. Three hundred and sixty-seven sheep \u2014 I\u2019d like to see Marty Sheargold do that\u2026 You could say there is a fox super-highway running between Keperra and Mount Coot-tha. The Brisbane City councillor says that the fox problem in western Brisbane is getting out of control. He declined to say if the \u201csuper-highway\u201d would be receiving state government funding. Independent\u00a0Suzie Holt\u00a0is this year taking her second run in Groom, a Queensland agricultural electorate covering Toowoomba and its rural surrounds. In\u00a02022, Holt cut the LNP\u2019s margin from 20.5% to 6.9%, taking it from the third safest seat to almost marginal. She was backed by \u201cVoices of Groom\u201d, formed in 2020 after the LNP preselected conservative\u00a0Garth Hamilton to replace the retiring John McVeigh. Holt \u2014 a supporter of McVeigh who got involved in that preselection,\u00a0backing two women\u00a0\u2014 doesn\u2019t openly criticise her opponent, beyond saying there was \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the choice. Hamilton, for his part,\u00a0dismissed her 2022 chances, right before his margin was slashed. Like many regional indies, Holt is a proud advocate for her area. The social worker talks glowingly about Groom\u2019s \u201ccountry feel\u201d, as well as its health and agriculture sectors. Her orange branding is about \u201cleaning \u200ainto our beautiful soils\u201d, which she repeatedly notes are among the best in Australia. Many newcomers to Australia know the surprise of discovering how hard it is to get phone service outside the big cities. The sheer size of the country goes some way to explaining mobile blackspots \u2014 although there are still dead zones on highly trafficked roads and rail sections like Sydney to Canberra. It\u2019s more than just an inconvenience for road trippers. Firefighters battling a huge summer bushfire in the Grampians in Victoria complained last month\u00a0that mobile phone reception was \u201cnearly non-existent\u201d in some areas, requiring them to drive elsewhere just to make phone calls and send messages. Labor claims it\u2019s come up with a solution to the problem.\u00a0According to\u00a0Communications Minister Michelle Rowland, an emerging technology that allows mobile phones to connect directly to satellites orbiting close to Earth will turn Australia into the world\u2019s \u201cmost connected continent\u201d, \u201cfilling the giant mobile black spot that could simply never be addressed through mobile tower deployment at this scale or speed\u201d. Yesterday, the prime minister himself announced $3.3 billion in new funding for roads and rail in Melbourne. It will fund \u201ctrack, bridge and signalling improvements to enable future upgrades to service Melbourne\u2019s north and west\u201d, as well as start work on the electrification of the Melton Line to the outer western fringes of the city. There\u2019ll be a \u201cSuburban Road Blitz\u201d (capitalised, Trump-style) of road upgrades, though two of the projects are in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs. But the biggest investment is $2 billion to redevelop Sunshine Railway Station in the western suburbs \u201cas part of our commitment to build the Melbourne Airport Rail\u201d. Successive governments, dating back to Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s, have promised $5 billion in Commonwealth funding for a rail link to Tullamarine. The project has been on-again-off-again because of fights between the Victorian government and Tullamarine\u2019s owner, which wanted a ludicrously expensive underground station. We\u2019re now told this brawl is over and the station will be above ground. Gene Hackman, Hollywood\u2019s consummate everyman, dies at 95 (The New York Times) Why are the Tate brothers in the US?

Orwell had a term for this: the people and their land will go down a \u201cmemory hole\u201d. That\u2019s just one of the Orwellian developments this week.

From now on, he announced, the paper would promote \u201cpersonal liberties and free markets\u201d in its opinion pages.

Improving and stabilising what had become a toxic bilateral relationship under Scott Morrison has been one of the Albanese government\u2019s major pluses in its foreign and trade policy. China has taken off all of the roughly\u00a0$20 billion in barriers\u00a0it had enacted on Australian exports. Australian lobsters are back on Chinese menus. And who can forget the PM\u2019s visit to China, when he was lauded as \u201ca handsome boy\u201d. But now, almost on the eve of the formal campaign, a Chinese military exercise in the Tasman Sea has not just reminded Australians of Chinese military power, but has left the PM appearing poorly informed. Or not wanting to offend the Chinese. Contributor Alex Cameron is a Melbourne-based journalist.

Politics Analysis Technology Share Many newcomers to Australia know the surprise of discovering how hard it is to get phone service outside the big cities. The sheer size of the country goes some way to explaining mobile blackspots \u2014 although there are still dead zones on highly trafficked roads and rail sections like Sydney to Canberra. It\u2019s more than just an inconvenience for roadtrippers. Firefighters battling a huge summer bushfire in the Grampians in Victoria complained last month that mobile phone reception was \u201cnearly non-existent\u201d in some areas, requiring them to drive elsewhere just to make phone calls and send messages. Labor claims it\u2019s come up with a solution to the problem. According to Communications Minister Michelle Rowland, an emerging technology that allows mobile phones to connect directly to satellites orbiting close to Earth will turn Australia into the world\u2019s \u201cmost connected continent\u201d, \u201cfilling the giant mobile black spot that could simply never be addressed through mobile tower deployment at this scale or speed\u201d. Labor\u2019s plans, which Crikey first revealed in December, involve legislating an obligation for telcos to provide mobile coverage, similar to the existing universal service obligation for equal access to landline phone services, payphones and broadband internet. The legislation would be brought in later this year if Labor is reelected. Looking at the Coalition\u2019s reaction to another Labor reelection pledge \u2014 to invest $8.5 billion into Medicare to increase bulk billing rates, met within hours with a Coalition promise to invest $9 billion \u2013 one might have thought Peter Dutton would simply copy this policy as well. But instead, Dutton\u2019s newly appointed communications spokesperson Melissa McIntosh criticised the proposal as an attempt to \u201cgrab a desperate headline\u201d. Judging by McIntosh\u2019s only comment on the policy \u2014 she declined requests for an interview and would not answer follow-up questions from Crikey \u2014 it seems her main problem with the\u00a0universal outdoor mobile obligation (UOMO) is that it was announced \u201con the eve of the election\u201d and \u201crushed [out] \u2026 during [Senate] estimates\u201d. McIntosh queried how much the policy would cost, saying in a media release: \u201cAustralians have been smashed by the government\u2019s cost of living crisis and will be rightly concerned about the prospect of higher mobile phone bills under the Albanese Labor government\u2019s last-minute plan.\u201d While Crikey understands the Coalition wouldn\u2019t necessarily block the policy in Parliament, McIntosh\u2019s knee-jerk negativity towards the idea brings to mind one of the Coalition\u2019s biggest policy fumbles in the communications space: the last-minute switch to the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) after taking government in 2013. The Coalition\u2019s decision to roll out a mixture of older technology and fiber-to-the-node rather than the planned fibre-to-premises version ended up costing three times its original forecast price, according to a secret report obtained by Guardian Australia in 2021. To add insult to injury, this decision for \u201climited infrastructure\u201d is also to blame for Australia\u2019s poor overall internet quality, according to a global ranking by Dutch virtual private network company Surfshark, which last month ranked Australia 37 out of 121 countries surveyed. While McIntosh was happy to slam the UOMO proposal for being \u201crushed\u201d \u2014\u00a0which gave Rowland ammunition to attack the Coalition as \u201cbackward\u201d \u2014 she declined to comment on what could be a much bigger potential concern: the idea of Elon Musk\u2019s growing involvement in Australia\u2019s telecommunications network. As Crikey reported earlier in the week, there few viable providers of low-to-Earth-orbit satellite services in Australia other than the Elon Musk-owned Starlink. Neither major party bloc is keen to criticise Musk, who has emerged as a de facto US cabinet member. Rowland would only go so far as to say the government would \u201cdeal with all operators in Australia on a professional basis\u201d when asked about Musk\u2019s potential influence in the proposed new scheme. But as RMIT School of Engineering Associate Professor Mark Gregory argued in comments to Crikey, unless Australia develops its own sovereign capabilities in this space, Australians\u2019 access to the new technology might be vulnerable to Musk\u2019s whims.

Yonhap Prosecutors raided the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) Friday over suspicions that it tried to conceal a court's initial denial of search warrants for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law imposition. Investigators from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office raided the CIO's headquarters to secure evidence related to the allegations, according to officials. The search came after Yoon's lawyers recently claimed that the CIO had requested search warrants against Yoon from the Seoul Central District Court, but the court denied the request. Later, the CIO separately filed for a detention warrant with the Seoul Western District Court, which issued it, leading to the detention of Yoon in January. Yoon's lawyers claimed that the CIO intentionally shifted to the Seoul Western District Court for the detention warrant to increase the chances of obtaining it. Yoon's side filed a complaint against the CIO's chief, claiming that the CIO responded negatively to a ruling party lawmaker's question about whether it had sought search warrants against Yoon from the central district court. The anti-corruption investigation office, however, refuted such claims, claiming that it sought the warrant from the Seoul Western District Court only because the presidential residence is located under the court's jurisdiction.

Yonhap A three-way meeting between the government and the rival parties was canceled Friday as the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) decided not to attend it, criticizing acting President Choi Sang-mok for continuing to withhold the appointment of a ninth justice at the Constitutional Court. The meeting, initially scheduled for Friday afternoon and aimed at coordinating state affairs, was canceled after DPK floor leader Park Chan-dae announced he will put off his participation in protest of Choi's refusal to appoint opposition-recommended Justice candidate Ma Eun-hyuk. \"The Constitutional Court unanimously ruled that rejecting the appointment of Justice Ma Eun-hyuk was unconstitutional,\" Park said. \"Nevertheless, acting President Choi Sang-mok is still delaying Ma's appointment.\" \"I will not be attending today's meeting,\" Park said, noting that he refuses to acknowledge Choi as acting president unless he \"fulfills his constitutional duties\" and appoint Ma. The government and rival political parties were expected to discuss pending bipartisan issues on pension reform and a supplementary budget, as well as a special law that seeks to exempt semiconductor workers from Korea's 52-hour workweek system. The Constitutional Court ruled Thursday that Choi's decision to withhold the appointment of a court justice last year is an unconstitutional act, infringing upon the right of the National Assembly. Observers have raised concerns that bipartisan talks could remain indefinitely stalled as President Yoon Suk Yeol faces an impeachment trial over his failed martial law bid.

Korea 'grace period' from 'America First' policy 18 New policy requires aspiring pet owners to complete educational program 20 Recovery, resignation, death: Pope Francis scenarios Close for 24 hours National Assembly in Seoul/ gettyimagesbank President Yoon Suk Yeol greatly undermined South Korea's democracy with his martial law imposition, which led to subsequent political turmoil and conflicts, according to an Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report. In EIU's \u201cDemocracy Index 2024,\u201d an annual assessment of various countries' democracy levels, South Korea ranked 32nd out of 167 countries, down from 22nd in 2022. The country\u2019s overall score declined from 8.09 to 7.75 out of a full score of 10, and the drop was the ninth largest among all countries surveyed. The 7.75 points were also the lowest for the country since 2006, when the index started. The fall in the score put Korea's democracy level in the \u201cflawed democracy\u201d category from the \u201cfull democracy\u201d classification, a status it had maintained since 2020. Countries scoring above 8.00 are considered full democracies, while those between 6.00 and 7.99 are categorized as flawed democracies. EIU attributed the downgrade to political instability linked to Yoon's botched martial law and the resulting political deadlock. \u201cThe president\u2019s attempt to impose martial law exposed some of the institutional and behavioral weaknesses of South Korea\u2019s political system,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe deep-rooted acrimony between political parties and an unwillingness to compromise makes the political system more unstable than it might first appear. Finally, the extreme political polarisation that characterizes the country\u2019s polity increases the risk of political violence and social unrest.\u201d Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, citing the need to eradicate \u201canti-state forces,\u201d referring to the opposition-led National Assembly. However, the Assembly swiftly passed a motion to lift the martial rule through a vote. About 10 days later, the Assembly impeached the president, and the Constitutional Court has been reviewing whether to uphold the impeachment. Although the rapid response from the Assembly and the public reaffirmed the nation\u2019s commitment to democratic institutions, EIU warned that the crisis underscored the fragility of South Korea\u2019s democratic framework. \u201cThe episode served as a reminder of the comparatively short track record (37 years) and relative frailty of democracy in South Korea,\u201d the report noted. According to the report, the global average score in 2024 was 5.17, a record low since the index\u2019s inception in 2006. The percentage of the world\u2019s population living under full democracies fell to 6.6 percent, down from 12.5 percent a decade ago. Meanwhile, two in five people worldwide now live under authoritarian regimes. In Asia, no country made the top 10. Taiwan ranked 12th (8.78 points), falling two spots, while Japan remained 16th (8.48 points). China rose three places to 145th (2.11 points) but remained categorized as an authoritarian state. North Korea ranked 165th, third from last, with an unchanged score of 1.08. Only Myanmar (0.96) and Afghanistan (0.25) ranked lower.

Korea Times photo by Choi Won-suk Park, a 33-year-old office worker in Seoul, plans to take a Korean national flag along with her light stick to the rally that supports the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol this Saturday. \"The national flag suits us better than the anti-impeachment rallies that aimed to justify President Yoon Suk Yeol's emergency martial law declaration,\" she said. \"March 1 Independence Day is also a good opportunity to reframe the image of the national flag.\" An anonymous user of X, formerly Twitter, who identifies as a member affiliated with the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), also agreed with this idea. She uploaded a photo of the Korean national flag on Sunday and wrote, \"What a perfect occasion to take the Taegeukgi (national flag) back. Let\u2019s raise the national flag on March 1, please.\" The post was shared more than 8,000 times and liked 10,900 times as of Friday. While the political heat has reached its peak on both sides of the rallies for and against the impeachment of Yoon for his short-lived martial law on Dec. 3, several pro-impeachment supporters are planning to wave the flag on Saturday, aiming to bring the Taegeukgi back from conservative supporters of the president. For the past few years, the national flag has become a prominent fixture of hardline conservative rallies in Korea. It started in 2016 during the impeachment trial of former President Park Geun-hye. A protest against former President Park Geun-hye's impeachment is held near the Constitutional Court in Seoul, March 9, 2017. Korea Times photo by Choi Won-suk Those opposing her impeachment chose to wave the Korean national flag, in contrast to the liberal candlelit vigil movement, saying \u201ccandle lights can be blown out, but the Taegeukgi stands for good.\u201d Even after Park's impeachment, conservatives have carried the national flag at rallies to express their opposition to the liberal bloc. Also known as \"Taegeukgi Budae,\" literally meaning \"National Flag Brigade,\" this far-right group of middle-aged to senior conservatives \u2014 many of whom are fundamentalist Christians \u2014 strongly supports Yoon, much like the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement backing Donald Trump in the U.S. They regularly hold rallies, waving Korean national flags, as well as American and sometimes even Israeli flags. Next to light sticks, the Taegeukgi has become rally-goers' second-favorite item at weekly pro-impeachment demonstrations, while some of the participants often bought 100 flags to share them with others joining the event. While the protests for and against Yoon\u2019s impeachment are expected to reach their peak on March 1, the national holiday commemorating the 1919 independence movement from Japan\u2019s colonial rule, political circles have also continued efforts to \"bring back the national flag.\" Rep. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party of Korea, wears a Taegeukgi pin during a party meeting at the National Assembly in Seoul, Dec. 9, 2024. Newsis DPK lawmakers have been wearing Taegeukgi pins instead of the lawmaker's gold pins since last December during meetings and official events. \"Based on common sense, people who felt out of line in the impeachment of President Yoon are moving to reclaim the national flag, which symbolizes Korea's national identity,\" Heo Chang-deok, a sociology professor at Yeungnam University, said. \"People's perceptions of the national flag are changing.\" \"The perception that the [young voters in their] 20s and 30s should remedy the country shaken up by the political turmoil has led to discussions to bring back the national symbol of the Taegeukgi to the general public,\" Chang Kyung-sup, a professor of sociology at Seoul National University, said. \"[Yoon\u2019s] rebellion has awakened democratic civic awareness.\" Bayern Munich beat Tottenham Hotspur in Seoul Tottenham 4-3 K-League All-Stars World Water Day 2024 Busan World Team Table Tennis Championships Finals Super Bowl 2024",

Yonhap Tens of thousands of people are expected to hold large-scale rallies for or against President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment Saturday, police said Friday, as the nation is still reeling from political fallout from Yoon's failed bid to impose martial law Dec. 3. Rallies are scheduled to take place in central Seoul, including Gwanghwamun, Jongno and Yeouido, prompting police and the Seoul city government to draw up measures for traffic and crowd controls, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Political polarization has heightened, with hearings of Yoon's impeachment trials completed early this week. The Constitutional Court has started deliberations to decide whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. Candlelight Action, a progressive civic group, will hold a national \"candlelight cultural festival\" at an intersection near Anguk Station at 2 p.m. The main opposition Democratic Party and four other opposition parties will hold a rally calling for Yoon's impeachment at 3:30 p.m. in the same location, and protesters will march together at 5 p.m. Rallies led by conservative activist pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon will gather near the Gwanghwamun area of central Seoul at 1 p.m. to oppose Yoon's impeachment and march toward the Constitutional Court. Separately, another conservative Christian group, Save Korea, will hold a prayer meeting near a road linking Yeouido to the Mapo Bridge. sookim@yna.co.kr (END) Bayern Munich beat Tottenham Hotspur in Seoul Tottenham 4-3 K-League All-Stars World Water Day 2024 Busan World Team Table Tennis Championships Finals Super Bowl 2024",

The organisational election process in some larger states as well as election-bound states, has been stuck due to internal differences and infighting, especially on the issue of selection of district presidents. Regional factionalism, leadership disputes and competing political priorities, including the Kumbh Mela and state elections, have further affected the timeline. \u201cOur effort is to wrap up the organisational polls by 20 March as many states are moving at a very slow pace. Our team is going from state to state to expedite the process so that the national election can take place,\u201d a party senior leader in charge of organisational polls told ThePrint.\nNaresh Bansal, co-in-charge of the organisational polls, also said the party was expecting to wrap up the polls by 20 March and many state presidents would be in place before Holi.\n\nAlso Read: Why BJP in Jharkhand, like Congress in Haryana, can\u2019t pick its leader in Assembly despite SC rap\n\n\n\nInfighting, Delhi polls & Kumbh\nIn major Hindi heartland states, the BJP has struggled to reach a consensus on a party president.\nFor instance, in Uttar Pradesh, multiple lists of district presidents were sent to Delhi but local leaders are still pushing for their own candidates at the mandal and district levels. As a result, the list was rejected and the election process has been delayed.\nSome state BJP leaders also cite the top leadership\u2019s involvement in the Kumbh Mela as a reason for the delay. One leader said Delhi didn\u2019t approve the list because of inadequate representation of women and Dalits, prompting the central leadership to ask for more representation of these groups in the selection of district presidents.\n\u201cLeaders were busy with the Delhi assembly election and Kumbh. So the process got delayed. But now very soon we will complete the process of the election of district presidents and the list will be released,\u201d Uttar Pradesh BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary told reporters Sunday when asked about the delay in the organisational polls.\nOne BJP leader in Uttar Pradesh told ThePrint that when general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh visited Lucknow in January, he urged leaders to complete the process by 15 January. More than a month has passed since, but the list has yet to be finalised.\n\n\n\u201cSince the assembly election in 2027 will be held under the new district presidents, their role in ticket selection and election strategy is important,\u201d the leader said.\n\u201cEvery minister and MP wants their own district president in their districts because in the recent Lok Sabha election, the BJP lost many seats in UP and one of the reasons cited was that the district president and MP were not on the same page in many districts. So, there is a lot of pressure on the selection of district presidents in UP.\u201d\nIn some states, the district and mandal-level presidents have been elected but the state president hasn\u2019t been announced yet.\nIn Madhya Pradesh, for instance, V.D. Sharma has completed his five-year tenure as state BJP president but the party still has not zeroed in on his replacement despite the district president getting elected. \u201cWe have completed our district-level polls and the state president will be announced any time now,\u201d said Madhya Pradesh organisational election in-charge Bhagwandas Sabnani.\nSimilarly, in Bihar, while district presidents have been announced, the election of state president Dilip Jaiswal has yet to take place because key leaders were busy with the Delhi election. Jaiswal, who was appointed a few months ago, is now set to be officially ratified on 4 March in the presence of a national observer.\n\n\nFrom Uttarakhand to Himachal Pradesh, the Delhi election and party infighting were cited as major reasons for the delay in many states.\nIn Haryana, for instance, a feud between current state president Mohan Lal Badoli and senior leader Anil Vij has affected organisational polls. Vij, who accused Badoli of misconduct, was served a notice for indiscipline.\nThe local body elections in Haryana have also contributed to the delay.\nIn Jharkhand, the organisational polls could only begin after the assembly election held last year and are expected to be completed by the end of March.\nIn Himachal Pradesh, former chief minister Jairam Thakur and current state president Rajeev Bindal recently met BJP chief J.P. Nadda in Delhi to push their claims, but no decision has been made yet.\n\n\nIn West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, the election of a state president is critical after the previous president, Sukanta Majumdar, was inducted into the Union Cabinet.\nBut the BJP is facing intense protests from its cadres in West Bengal over the election of mandal presidents. Though the party recently appointed 1,000 out of 1,280 mandal presidents in the state, the process has sparked protests, with BJP MLA Satyendra Nath Ray even questioning the selection process.\nWith mandal president elections being the first step, the district president elections will take even more time, further delaying the selection of a new state president.\nThe strained ties between the old guard and Suvendu Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP from the TMC, over the election of state president is another challenge for the BJP.\nThe BJP has completed its organisational election process in 12 smaller states and Union Territories. These are Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Chandigarh, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Ladakh, Meghalaya and Nagaland.\n\n\nThe only Hindi heartland state where the process is complete is Rajasthan, where incumbent Madan Rathore has been re-elected as state president.\n\nAlso Read: How Nitish Kumar used cabinet expansion to indulge ally BJP ahead of Bihar polls\n\nInfighting in southern states\nIn most southern states, the election of the state BJP president has been delayed as the election for the district president hasn\u2019t been completed and warring factions in the party are still to arrive at a consensus over their choice of state president.\nIn Karnataka, the election of the state president has been delayed due to internal opposition to the current state BJP chief B.Y. Vijayendra. The anti-Vijayendra faction, led by former minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, has threatened to field a candidate if a leadership election is held.\nSenior BJP leaders\u2014including MLAs Yatnal and Ramesh Jarkiholi, former MP G.M. Siddeshwara, and former MLAs B.P. Harish, Kumar Bangarappa and N.R. Santhosh\u2014have openly challenged Vijayendra\u2019s leadership.\n\n\nAfter Yatnal\u2019s rebellion, the central leadership sent him a disciplinary notice, but the ongoing infighting has further stalled the selection of Karnataka\u2019s state president.\nFormer MLA Kumar Bangarappa has reiterated in the past that the rebel group has not backed down from contesting the election for the state president\u2019s post. \u201cWe have not taken back our decision. If elections are held, our candidate will contest. The state president will definitely be changed. We have informed the high command about the situation in Karnataka. We are not backing down,\u201d he said.\nIn Telangana, 19 district presidents have been elected but a new state president to replace G. Kishan Reddy hasn\u2019t been elected yet because of a lack of consensus.\nReddy told reporters last week that his appointment as state president was only meant to be for three or four months, but had been extended because the appointment of a new president had been postponed for various reasons. However, he said the state would have a new president before local body polls which are expected in March.\nHowever, party sources said infighting over the next state president has delayed the decision, with the central leadership yet to make a final call. When Bandi Sanjay was replaced as state president in July 2023, one reason for bringing G. Kishan Reddy was his acceptability among all factions.\n\n\nNow that Reddy is a Union minister, an election for the post of state president is on the cards.\nIn recent days, MLC Ramchander Rao was in Delhi lobbying for the position, though many senior leaders did not meet him due to the Parliament session. The delay stems from the party\u2019s failure to build a consensus among a host of contenders, including former minister Eatala Rajender, BJP national vice president D.K. Aruna, and Ramchander Rao.\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala where Assembly elections are due next year, the BJP is still to take a call on whether to stick with incumbents or pick a new president.\nK. Annamalai has been state president in Tamil Nadu since July 2021 while K. Surendran has been in the position in Kerala since February 2020 despite opposition from within the party.\nThe party lost the 2021 Assembly election under Surendran\u2019s leadership party but made inroads in last year\u2019s Lok Sabha election, winning its first parliamentary seat in the state.\n\n\nDespite the recent Palakkad bypoll setback, the BJP leadership has resisted pressure from the anti-Surendran camp. One line of thought among party leaders is to retain K. Surendran as state president for the 2026 Assembly elections.\n(Edited by Sugita Katyal)\n\nAlso Read: How a Hindi phrase in UCC is making even Uttarakhand BJP leaders squeamish Regional factionalism, leadership disputes and competing political priorities, including the Kumbh Mela and state elections, have further affected the timeline. \u201cOur effort is to wrap up the organisational polls by 20 March as many states are moving at a very slow pace.

Vij, who accused Badoli of misconduct, was served a notice for indiscipline.\nThe local body elections in Haryana have also contributed to the delay.\nIn Jharkhand, the organisational polls could only begin after the assembly election held last year and are expected to be completed by the end of March.\nIn Himachal Pradesh, former chief minister Jairam Thakur and current state president Rajeev Bindal recently met BJP chief J.P. Nadda in Delhi to push their claims, but no decision has been made yet.\n\n\nIn West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, the election of a state president is critical after the previous president, Sukanta Majumdar, was inducted into the Union Cabinet.\nBut the BJP is facing intense protests from its cadres in West Bengal over the election of mandal presidents. Though the party recently appointed 1,000 out of 1,280 mandal presidents in the state, the process has sparked protests, with BJP MLA Satyendra Nath Ray even questioning the selection process.\nWith mandal president elections being the first step, the district president elections will take even more time, further delaying the selection of a new state president.\nThe strained ties between the old guard and Suvendu Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP from the TMC, over the election of state president is another challenge for the BJP.\nThe BJP has completed its organisational election process in 12 smaller states and Union Territories. These are Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Chandigarh, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Ladakh, Meghalaya and Nagaland.\n\n\nThe only Hindi heartland state where the process is complete is Rajasthan, where incumbent Madan Rathore has been re-elected as state president.\n\nAlso Read: How Nitish Kumar used cabinet expansion to indulge ally BJP ahead of Bihar polls\n\nInfighting in southern states\nIn most southern states, the election of the state BJP president has been delayed as the election for the district president hasn\u2019t been completed and warring factions in the party are still to arrive at a consensus over their choice of state president.\nIn Karnataka, the election of the state president has been delayed due to internal opposition to the current state BJP chief B.Y. Vijayendra. The anti-Vijayendra faction, led by former minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, has threatened to field a candidate if a leadership election is held.\nSenior BJP leaders\u2014including MLAs Yatnal and Ramesh Jarkiholi, former MP G.M. Siddeshwara, and former MLAs B.P. Harish, Kumar Bangarappa and N.R. Santhosh\u2014have openly challenged Vijayendra\u2019s leadership.\n\n\nAfter Yatnal\u2019s rebellion, the central leadership sent him a disciplinary notice, but the ongoing infighting has further stalled the selection of Karnataka\u2019s state president.\nFormer MLA Kumar Bangarappa has reiterated in the past that the rebel group has not backed down from contesting the election for the state president\u2019s post. \u201cWe have not taken back our decision. If elections are held, our candidate will contest. The state president will definitely be changed. We have informed the high command about the situation in Karnataka. We are not backing down,\u201d he said.\nIn Telangana, 19 district presidents have been elected but a new state president to replace G. Kishan Reddy hasn\u2019t been elected yet because of a lack of consensus.\nReddy told reporters last week that his appointment as state president was only meant to be for three or four months, but had been extended because the appointment of a new president had been postponed for various reasons. However, he said the state would have a new president before local body polls which are expected in March.\nHowever, party sources said infighting over the next state president has delayed the decision, with the central leadership yet to make a final call. When Bandi Sanjay was replaced as state president in July 2023, one reason for bringing G. Kishan Reddy was his acceptability among all factions.\n\n\nNow that Reddy is a Union minister, an election for the post of state president is on the cards.\nIn recent days, MLC Ramchander Rao was in Delhi lobbying for the position, though many senior leaders did not meet him due to the Parliament session. The delay stems from the party\u2019s failure to build a consensus among a host of contenders, including former minister Eatala Rajender, BJP national vice president D.K. Aruna, and Ramchander Rao.\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala where Assembly elections are due next year, the BJP is still to take a call on whether to stick with incumbents or pick a new president.\nK. Annamalai has been state president in Tamil Nadu since July 2021 while K. Surendran has been in the position in Kerala since February 2020 despite opposition from within the party.\nThe party lost the 2021 Assembly election under Surendran\u2019s leadership party but made inroads in last year\u2019s Lok Sabha election, winning its first parliamentary seat in the state.\n\n\nDespite the recent Palakkad bypoll setback, the BJP leadership has resisted pressure from the anti-Surendran camp. One line of thought among party leaders is to retain K.

Jaiswal, who was appointed a few months ago, is now set to be officially ratified on 4 March in the presence of a national observer.\n\n\nFrom Uttarakhand to Himachal Pradesh, the Delhi election and party infighting were cited as major reasons for the delay in many states.\nIn Haryana, for instance, a feud between current state president Mohan Lal Badoli and senior leader Anil Vij has affected organisational polls. Vij, who accused Badoli of misconduct, was served a notice for indiscipline.\nThe local body elections in Haryana have also contributed to the delay.\nIn Jharkhand, the organisational polls could only begin after the assembly election held last year and are expected to be completed by the end of March.\nIn Himachal Pradesh, former chief minister Jairam Thakur and current state president Rajeev Bindal recently met BJP chief J.P. Nadda in Delhi to push their claims, but no decision has been made yet.\n\n\nIn West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, the election of a state president is critical after the previous president, Sukanta Majumdar, was inducted into the Union Cabinet.\nBut the BJP is facing intense protests from its cadres in West Bengal over the election of mandal presidents. Though the party recently appointed 1,000 out of 1,280 mandal presidents in the state, the process has sparked protests, with BJP MLA Satyendra Nath Ray even questioning the selection process.\nWith mandal president elections being the first step, the district president elections will take even more time, further delaying the selection of a new state president.\nThe strained ties between the old guard and Suvendu Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP from the TMC, over the election of state president is another challenge for the BJP.\nThe BJP has completed its organisational election process in 12 smaller states and Union Territories. These are Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Chandigarh, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Ladakh, Meghalaya and Nagaland.\n\n\nThe only Hindi heartland state where the process is complete is Rajasthan, where incumbent Madan Rathore has been re-elected as state president.\n\nAlso Read: How Nitish Kumar used cabinet expansion to indulge ally BJP ahead of Bihar polls\n\nInfighting in southern states\nIn most southern states, the election of the state BJP president has been delayed as the election for the district president hasn\u2019t been completed and warring factions in the party are still to arrive at a consensus over their choice of state president.\nIn Karnataka, the election of the state president has been delayed due to internal opposition to the current state BJP chief B.Y. Vijayendra. The anti-Vijayendra faction, led by former minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, has threatened to field a candidate if a leadership election is held.\nSenior BJP leaders\u2014including MLAs Yatnal and Ramesh Jarkiholi, former MP G.M.

If elections are held, our candidate will contest. The state president will definitely be changed. We have informed the high command about the situation in Karnataka. We are not backing down,\u201d he said.\nIn Telangana, 19 district presidents have been elected but a new state president to replace G. Kishan Reddy hasn\u2019t been elected yet because of a lack of consensus.\nReddy told reporters last week that his appointment as state president was only meant to be for three or four months, but had been extended because the appointment of a new president had been postponed for various reasons. However, he said the state would have a new president before local body polls which are expected in March.\nHowever, party sources said infighting over the next state president has delayed the decision, with the central leadership yet to make a final call. When Bandi Sanjay was replaced as state president in July 2023, one reason for bringing G. Kishan Reddy was his acceptability among all factions.\n\n\nNow that Reddy is a Union minister, an election for the post of state president is on the cards.\nIn recent days, MLC Ramchander Rao was in Delhi lobbying for the position, though many senior leaders did not meet him due to the Parliament session. The delay stems from the party\u2019s failure to build a consensus among a host of contenders, including former minister Eatala Rajender, BJP national vice president D.K. Aruna, and Ramchander Rao.\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala where Assembly elections are due next year, the BJP is still to take a call on whether to stick with incumbents or pick a new president.\nK. Annamalai has been state president in Tamil Nadu since July 2021 while K. Surendran has been in the position in Kerala since February 2020 despite opposition from within the party.\nThe party lost the 2021 Assembly election under Surendran\u2019s leadership party but made inroads in last year\u2019s Lok Sabha election, winning its first parliamentary seat in the state.\n\n\nDespite the recent Palakkad bypoll setback, the BJP leadership has resisted pressure from the anti-Surendran camp.

Santhosh\u2014have openly challenged Vijayendra\u2019s leadership.\n\n\nAfter Yatnal\u2019s rebellion, the central leadership sent him a disciplinary notice, but the ongoing infighting has further stalled the selection of Karnataka\u2019s state president.\nFormer MLA Kumar Bangarappa has reiterated in the past that the rebel group has not backed down from contesting the election for the state president\u2019s post. \u201cWe have not taken back our decision. If elections are held, our candidate will contest. The state president will definitely be changed. We have informed the high command about the situation in Karnataka. We are not backing down,\u201d he said.\nIn Telangana, 19 district presidents have been elected but a new state president to replace G. Kishan Reddy hasn\u2019t been elected yet because of a lack of consensus.\nReddy told reporters last week that his appointment as state president was only meant to be for three or four months, but had been extended because the appointment of a new president had been postponed for various reasons. However, he said the state would have a new president before local body polls which are expected in March.\nHowever, party sources said infighting over the next state president has delayed the decision, with the central leadership yet to make a final call. When Bandi Sanjay was replaced as state president in July 2023, one reason for bringing G. Kishan Reddy was his acceptability among all factions.\n\n\nNow that Reddy is a Union minister, an election for the post of state president is on the cards.\nIn recent days, MLC Ramchander Rao was in Delhi lobbying for the position, though many senior leaders did not meet him due to the Parliament session. The delay stems from the party\u2019s failure to build a consensus among a host of contenders, including former minister Eatala Rajender, BJP national vice president D.K. Aruna, and Ramchander Rao.\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala where Assembly elections are due next year, the BJP is still to take a call on whether to stick with incumbents or pick a new president.\nK. Annamalai has been state president in Tamil Nadu since July 2021 while K. Surendran has been in the position in Kerala since February 2020 despite opposition from within the party.\nThe party lost the 2021 Assembly election under Surendran\u2019s leadership party but made inroads in last year\u2019s Lok Sabha election, winning its first parliamentary seat in the state.\n\n\nDespite the recent Palakkad bypoll setback, the BJP leadership has resisted pressure from the anti-Surendran camp. One line of thought among party leaders is to retain K. Surendran as state president for the 2026 Assembly elections.\n(Edited by Sugita Katyal)\n\nAlso Read: How a Hindi phrase in UCC is making even Uttarakhand BJP leaders squeamish Also Read: How Nitish Kumar used cabinet expansion to indulge ally BJP ahead of Bihar polls Infighting in southern states\nIn most southern states, the election of the state BJP president has been delayed as the election for the district president hasn\u2019t been completed and warring factions in the party are still to arrive at a consensus over their choice of state president.\nIn Karnataka, the election of the state president has been delayed due to internal opposition to the current state BJP chief B.Y.

To add to the BJP\u2019s embarrassment, the Supreme Court was forced to intervene in the party\u2019s affairs with an aim to expedite the election of a Leader of the Opposition, which is a pre-requisite for appointments to various constitutional posts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShow Full Article To add to the BJP\u2019s embarrassment, the Supreme Court was forced to intervene in the party\u2019s affairs with an aim to expedite the election of a Leader of the Opposition, which is a pre-requisite for appointments to various constitutional posts. This was the first time in recent years a court had to intervene in the process through which a political party elects its legislative party leader, since it has delayed the\u00a0appointments of the state information commissioner and state human rights commission member. The post of the state information commissioner, for instance, has been lying vacant since May 2020.\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s directive to complete the process by 12 January, the BJP has yet to name its legislative party leader or pick a chief whip in the Assembly.\nThe BJP\u2019s indecision has drawn comparisons with that of the Congress in Haryana where the party has failed to pick an LoP more than four months after the elections due to apparent infighting between Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Randeep Surjewala and Kumari Selja.\n\n\nBut unlike Haryana, the problem in Jharkhand is not factionalism but more the indecisiveness of the BJP high command, sources in the party told ThePrint.\n\u201cAfter back-to-back defeats in Jharkhand in the 2019 and 2024 assembly polls, Jharkhand is not an immediate priority of the BJP central leadership,\u201d said a senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named.\u00a0Adding, \u201cThe central leadership was occupied with the Union Budget preparation, the Parliament session, the Delhi election and the PM\u2019s US visit.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Thackerays have a plan to whip up support before civic polls. It starts on Shinde\u2019s home turf\n\nBJP leadership in no hurry\nThe leadership vacuum was evident last week when the BJP skipped an all-party meeting before the start of the budget session because it hadn\u2019t elected a leader in the House.\nThough Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahato invited the party\u2019s seniormost MLA C.P. Singh to attend the all-party meeting in the absence of a BJP leader, no BJP member was in attendance.\n\n\nState BJP president Babulal Marandi has been pushing for a quick decision on the legislative party leader. On Tuesday, Marandi himself took charge by leading a protest in the Assembly, sidelining most party leaders to attack the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) government on the issue of paper leaks.\nDespite Marandi\u2019s push, BJP leaders said the party was in no hurry as it wanted to make a considered decision. \u201cBrainstorming on Jharkhand was not held despite Babulal Marandi\u2019s reminder to general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh about the need for a speedy decision. The BJP leadership asked him to wait as the high command wasn\u2019t in a hurry and wanted to pick someone after thoughtful consideration,\u201d said a second BJP leader.\nEven when Marandi visited Delhi after the Assembly election results, discussions centred around the party\u2019s organisational polls.\nOn Monday, when BJP general secretary Sunil Bansal held a meeting with the state unit, the primary agenda was completing the organisational polls by the end of March.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the prerogative of the central leadership, and they will choose a leader in the Assembly at the right time as they have been busy with several other things,\u201d BJP general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Aditya Sahu told ThePrint.\n\n\nBJP\u2019s dilemma in Jharkhand\nApart from the central leadership\u2019s preoccupation with other issues, there are multiple reasons for the delay. One BJP leader said the delay was tied to organisational polls and caste calculations. \u201cWith the Jharkhand organisational polls underway\u2014delayed after the Assembly elections\u2014the party has to pick a new state president by March,\u201d the leader said.\nAdding, \u201cThe party has to recalibrate its entire caste strategy after two back-to-back defeats in the Assembly polls. If the Leader of the Opposition is chosen from the tribal community, then the state president can be a non-tribal, or vice versa.\u201d The leader noted that the current state president, Babulal Marandi, is from the tribal community.\n\u201cIf the party picks Raghubar Das, who recently returned to active politics after a gubernatorial stint, as the state president\u2014an OBC face\u2014then a tribal leader might be chosen for the Assembly,\u201d the BJP leader added. \u201cThe central leadership has to take a decision on both posts, not just one.\u201d\nThat its decision to place stock in tribal leadership in Jharkhand hasn\u2019t paid off like it did in Odisha or Chhattisgarh adds another layer to the party\u2019s dilemma.\nMost of the party\u2019s prominent tribal leaders in Jharkhand lost in the Assembly polls. The BJP won only one of 28 reserved seats.\n\n\nIt has only two tribal leaders in the Assembly: Babulal Marandi who won from a general seat and former JMM leader Champai Soren who won from a reserved seat.\nApart from a limited talent pool among tribal leaders in the Assembly, the party is grappling with another problem. Most experienced faces of the last Assembly from Amar Bauri and Nilkanth Munda to Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Biranchi Narayan lost in the last election.\n\u201cThe party has limitations in tribal leadership. If it wants to pick a younger leader from the tribal quota, then it will have to select a leader in the assembly from the OBC or \u2018upper caste\u2019 group,\u201d said the party leader.\nThe BJP leader acknowledged that one of the party\u2019s biggest challenges was to draft a five-year strategy for the next Assembly election and decide whether to continue its tribal outreach or shift focus towards the OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, which have been its core vote bank traditionally.\nThe dilemma stems from its setbacks in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.\n\n\nWhen the BJP brought Babulal Marandi back into the party and made him the Leader of the Opposition and the state party president later, it expected him to dethrone the JMM\u2019s Hemant Soren. But party leaders said Marandi didn\u2019t quite live up to their expectations.\nNot only did the BJP fail to unseat Soren but its performance in the Lok Sabha polls wasn\u2019t impressive either. Former chief minister Arjun Munda, another key tribal face, lost in the Lok Sabha elections. \u201cThe BJP could not win back the lost tribal constituency against Hemant Soren. The party lost the Kurmi vote and many sections of the traditional OBC vote too. Now the party is perplexed whether it should continue to woo tribals or reach out to OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, the BJP\u2019s traditional vote bank,\u201d said the party leader.\nExperienced face for Assembly\nAccording to a former state unit chief, the party has an opportunity to experiment with new leadership in the state as it gears up to take on the JMM on the ground over the next five years. \u201cBut another thought in the party is that if we let go of the tribal segment, it may hurt us in other states. That is why the party is taking time to pick names for both state president and legislature party leader,\u201d said the leader.\nPradeep Verma, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of organisational polls, told ThePrint that although the selection of both posts is not linked, the central leadership will consider the \u201ccaste arithmetic\u201d.\n\u201cIn the assembly, the party needs an experienced face who can corner the government on the floor and guide our MLAs, while in the organisation, the party needs a streetfighter for the next few years to make inroads into newer untouched areas,\u201d Verma said.\n\n\nHistorically, the BJP in Jharkhand has rotated the posts of state president and legislature party leader between tribals and non-tribals.\nIn 2009, Das, who is from the OBC community, was state president and Arjun Munda, a tribal, was leader of the legislative party. An exception was made in 2014 when both posts were given to non-tribals. Ahead of the 2019 Assembly election, the BJP was back to dividing the two posts within the two groups. Laxman Gilua, a tribal, was made state president while Das was chief minister and legislature party leader.\nAfter its defeat in the 2019 elections, an alarmed BJP leadership decided to bring back Marandi, and he was made legislative party leader while Deepak Prakash from the non-tribal group was made state president. The party in July 2023 picked Marandi as state president and Amar Bauri was made leader of the the Opposition.\nBJP turning into the Congress\nThe BJP\u2019s indecision isn\u2019t limited to Jharkhand. In Karnataka, the party high command took six months after its 2023 election defeat to appoint Vokkaliga leader R. Ashoka as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.\nWith the Lingayat and Vokkliga factions vying for the post, it took the BJP many months to pacify both sides. Eventually, B.Y. Vijayendra, the son of former chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, was named the state party president, while Ashoka was chosen as the opposition leader.\n\n\nIn contrast, during Union Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s tenure as party president, the BJP was quick to appoint opposition leaders after election losses in three states.\nIn 2018, Gulab Chand Kataria in Rajasthan, Gopal Bhargava in Madhya Pradesh and Dharamlal Kaushik in Chhattisgarh were picked within a month of the Assembly election.\nThe party also took two years to take a decision on removing Biren Singh as Manipur chief minister. Similarly, it took almost a year to send disciplinary notices to Kirodi Lal Meena in Rajasthan, Basangouda Patil Yatnal in Karnataka and Anil Vij in Haryana for speaking out against the party leadership in their states.\nThe party has yet to decide whether Meena\u2019s resignation will be accepted or not.\n\u201cSometimes not taking a decision is also a decision as in the case of Manipur. But in the case of those states where the BJP lost, the party waited for temperatures to cool down and for warring factions to lose steam. The party then took a decision at the right time,\u201d said another senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named. \u201cSince BJP is like a big ship, several leaders keep fighting always. But the party resolves them in a democratic way.\u201d\n\n\n(Edited by Sugita Katyal)\n\nAlso Read: Punjab Oppn sees Kejriwal clearing path to Rajya Sabha as AAP fields MP Sanjeev Arora in bypoll This was the first time in recent years a court had to intervene in the process through which a political party elects its legislative party leader, since it has delayed the\u00a0appointments of the state information commissioner and state human rights commission member.

One BJP leader said the delay was tied to organisational polls and caste calculations. \u201cWith the Jharkhand organisational polls underway\u2014delayed after the Assembly elections\u2014the party has to pick a new state president by March,\u201d the leader said.\nAdding, \u201cThe party has to recalibrate its entire caste strategy after two back-to-back defeats in the Assembly polls. If the Leader of the Opposition is chosen from the tribal community, then the state president can be a non-tribal, or vice versa.\u201d The leader noted that the current state president, Babulal Marandi, is from the tribal community.\n\u201cIf the party picks Raghubar Das, who recently returned to active politics after a gubernatorial stint, as the state president\u2014an OBC face\u2014then a tribal leader might be chosen for the Assembly,\u201d the BJP leader added. \u201cThe central leadership has to take a decision on both posts, not just one.\u201d\nThat its decision to place stock in tribal leadership in Jharkhand hasn\u2019t paid off like it did in Odisha or Chhattisgarh adds another layer to the party\u2019s dilemma.\nMost of the party\u2019s prominent tribal leaders in Jharkhand lost in the Assembly polls. The BJP won only one of 28 reserved seats.\n\n\nIt has only two tribal leaders in the Assembly: Babulal Marandi who won from a general seat and former JMM leader Champai Soren who won from a reserved seat.\nApart from a limited talent pool among tribal leaders in the Assembly, the party is grappling with another problem. Most experienced faces of the last Assembly from Amar Bauri and Nilkanth Munda to Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Biranchi Narayan lost in the last election.\n\u201cThe party has limitations in tribal leadership. If it wants to pick a younger leader from the tribal quota, then it will have to select a leader in the assembly from the OBC or \u2018upper caste\u2019 group,\u201d said the party leader.\nThe BJP leader acknowledged that one of the party\u2019s biggest challenges was to draft a five-year strategy for the next Assembly election and decide whether to continue its tribal outreach or shift focus towards the OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, which have been its core vote bank traditionally.\nThe dilemma stems from its setbacks in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.\n\n\nWhen the BJP brought Babulal Marandi back into the party and made him the Leader of the Opposition and the state party president later, it expected him to dethrone the JMM\u2019s Hemant Soren. But party leaders said Marandi didn\u2019t quite live up to their expectations.\nNot only did the BJP fail to unseat Soren but its performance in the Lok Sabha polls wasn\u2019t impressive either. Former chief minister Arjun Munda, another key tribal face, lost in the Lok Sabha elections. \u201cThe BJP could not win back the lost tribal constituency against Hemant Soren. The party lost the Kurmi vote and many sections of the traditional OBC vote too. Now the party is perplexed whether it should continue to woo tribals or reach out to OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, the BJP\u2019s traditional vote bank,\u201d said the party leader.\nExperienced face for Assembly\nAccording to a former state unit chief, the party has an opportunity to experiment with new leadership in the state as it gears up to take on the JMM on the ground over the next five years. \u201cBut another thought in the party is that if we let go of the tribal segment, it may hurt us in other states. That is why the party is taking time to pick names for both state president and legislature party leader,\u201d said the leader.\nPradeep Verma, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of organisational polls, told ThePrint that although the selection of both posts is not linked, the central leadership will consider the \u201ccaste arithmetic\u201d.\n\u201cIn the assembly, the party needs an experienced face who can corner the government on the floor and guide our MLAs, while in the organisation, the party needs a streetfighter for the next few years to make inroads into newer untouched areas,\u201d Verma said.\n\n\nHistorically, the BJP in Jharkhand has rotated the posts of state president and legislature party leader between tribals and non-tribals.\nIn 2009, Das, who is from the OBC community, was state president and Arjun Munda, a tribal, was leader of the legislative party. An exception was made in 2014 when both posts were given to non-tribals. Ahead of the 2019 Assembly election, the BJP was back to dividing the two posts within the two groups. Laxman Gilua, a tribal, was made state president while Das was chief minister and legislature party leader.\nAfter its defeat in the 2019 elections, an alarmed BJP leadership decided to bring back Marandi, and he was made legislative party leader while Deepak Prakash from the non-tribal group was made state president.

One BJP leader said the delay was tied to organisational polls and caste calculations. \u201cWith the Jharkhand organisational polls underway\u2014delayed after the Assembly elections\u2014the party has to pick a new state president by March,\u201d the leader said. Adding, \u201cThe party has to recalibrate its entire caste strategy after two back-to-back defeats in the Assembly polls. If the Leader of the Opposition is chosen from the tribal community, then the state president can be a non-tribal, or vice versa.\u201d The leader noted that the current state president, Babulal Marandi, is from the tribal community.\n\u201cIf the party picks Raghubar Das, who recently returned to active politics after a gubernatorial stint, as the state president\u2014an OBC face\u2014then a tribal leader might be chosen for the Assembly,\u201d the BJP leader added. \u201cThe central leadership has to take a decision on both posts, not just one.\u201d\nThat its decision to place stock in tribal leadership in Jharkhand hasn\u2019t paid off like it did in Odisha or Chhattisgarh adds another layer to the party\u2019s dilemma.\nMost of the party\u2019s prominent tribal leaders in Jharkhand lost in the Assembly polls. The BJP won only one of 28 reserved seats.\n\n\nIt has only two tribal leaders in the Assembly: Babulal Marandi who won from a general seat and former JMM leader Champai Soren who won from a reserved seat.\nApart from a limited talent pool among tribal leaders in the Assembly, the party is grappling with another problem. Most experienced faces of the last Assembly from Amar Bauri and Nilkanth Munda to Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Biranchi Narayan lost in the last election.\n\u201cThe party has limitations in tribal leadership. If it wants to pick a younger leader from the tribal quota, then it will have to select a leader in the assembly from the OBC or \u2018upper caste\u2019 group,\u201d said the party leader.\nThe BJP leader acknowledged that one of the party\u2019s biggest challenges was to draft a five-year strategy for the next Assembly election and decide whether to continue its tribal outreach or shift focus towards the OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, which have been its core vote bank traditionally.\nThe dilemma stems from its setbacks in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.\n\n\nWhen the BJP brought Babulal Marandi back into the party and made him the Leader of the Opposition and the state party president later, it expected him to dethrone the JMM\u2019s Hemant Soren. But party leaders said Marandi didn\u2019t quite live up to their expectations.\nNot only did the BJP fail to unseat Soren but its performance in the Lok Sabha polls wasn\u2019t impressive either. Former chief minister Arjun Munda, another key tribal face, lost in the Lok Sabha elections. \u201cThe BJP could not win back the lost tribal constituency against Hemant Soren. The party lost the Kurmi vote and many sections of the traditional OBC vote too. Now the party is perplexed whether it should continue to woo tribals or reach out to OBCs and \u2018upper castes\u2019, the BJP\u2019s traditional vote bank,\u201d said the party leader.\nExperienced face for Assembly\nAccording to a former state unit chief, the party has an opportunity to experiment with new leadership in the state as it gears up to take on the JMM on the ground over the next five years. \u201cBut another thought in the party is that if we let go of the tribal segment, it may hurt us in other states. That is why the party is taking time to pick names for both state president and legislature party leader,\u201d said the leader.\nPradeep Verma, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of organisational polls, told ThePrint that although the selection of both posts is not linked, the central leadership will consider the \u201ccaste arithmetic\u201d.\n\u201cIn the assembly, the party needs an experienced face who can corner the government on the floor and guide our MLAs, while in the organisation, the party needs a streetfighter for the next few years to make inroads into newer untouched areas,\u201d Verma said.\n\n\nHistorically, the BJP in Jharkhand has rotated the posts of state president and legislature party leader between tribals and non-tribals.\nIn 2009, Das, who is from the OBC community, was state president and Arjun Munda, a tribal, was leader of the legislative party. An exception was made in 2014 when both posts were given to non-tribals. Ahead of the 2019 Assembly election, the BJP was back to dividing the two posts within the two groups. Laxman Gilua, a tribal, was made state president while Das was chief minister and legislature party leader.\nAfter its defeat in the 2019 elections, an alarmed BJP leadership decided to bring back Marandi, and he was made legislative party leader while Deepak Prakash from the non-tribal group was made state president. The party in July 2023 picked Marandi as state president and Amar Bauri was made leader of the the Opposition.\nBJP turning into the Congress\nThe BJP\u2019s indecision isn\u2019t limited to Jharkhand. In Karnataka, the party high command took six months after its 2023 election defeat to appoint Vokkaliga leader R. Ashoka as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.\nWith the Lingayat and Vokkliga factions vying for the post, it took the BJP many months to pacify both sides. Eventually, B.Y. Vijayendra, the son of former chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, was named the state party president, while Ashoka was chosen as the opposition leader.\n\n\nIn contrast, during Union Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s tenure as party president, the BJP was quick to appoint opposition leaders after election losses in three states.\nIn 2018, Gulab Chand Kataria in Rajasthan, Gopal Bhargava in Madhya Pradesh and Dharamlal Kaushik in Chhattisgarh were picked within a month of the Assembly election.\nThe party also took two years to take a decision on removing Biren Singh as Manipur chief minister. Similarly, it took almost a year to send disciplinary notices to Kirodi Lal Meena in Rajasthan, Basangouda Patil Yatnal in Karnataka and Anil Vij in Haryana for speaking out against the party leadership in their states.\nThe party has yet to decide whether Meena\u2019s resignation will be accepted or not.\n\u201cSometimes not taking a decision is also a decision as in the case of Manipur.

        "text": "LOGIN President Cyril Ramaphosa said while the US decided to snub the meeting, G20 will continue with or without them. \u201cAbsence of the U.S. Secretary of State at the first #G20 Foreign Ministers meeting doesn\u2019t halt proceedings, as long as other #G20 members are present, the discussions go on,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe absence of some leaders is not the end of the world as long the G20 leaders are able to meet to discuss important issues, that is what we aim for.\u201d He said the country will work to \u201ciron out wrinkles\u201d in its relationship with the US, adding that the absence of Washington\u2019s top diplomat from Group of 20 meetings in Johannesburg isn\u2019t \u201ca boycott as other US representatives are around.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to find ways, avenues and means through which we can continue relating to each other,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters in Johannesburg Thursday. He added that South Africa has resolved to use diplomatic processes to deal with issues that \u201cmay have appeared in our relationship.\u201d The president\u2019s comments come as South Africa seeks to mend its fast-deteriorating relationship with the US \u2014 a relationship that soured after US President Donald Trump criticised South Africa about its recently signed Expropriation Act. US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio snubbed the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Johannesburg this week. Despite this, Ramaphosa said South Africa remained committed to diplomatic conflict resolution, citing the country\u2019s history of successful negotiations. He welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, describing it as a critical step towards alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel and Hamas agreed on a deal that will halt the war in Gaza and see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. \u201cThis ceasefire must lay the basis for a just and lasting peace in line with UN resolutions, international law and internationally agreed parameters. As the G20, we must continue to advocate for diplomatic solutions,\u201d he said. He added that the ceasefire must lay the basis for a just and lasting peace in line with UN resolutions, international law and internationally agreed parameters. \u201cAs the G20, we must continue to advocate for diplomatic solutions. Our own experience as South Africa is that the peaceful resolution of conflict through inclusive dialogue is the foremost guarantor of sustainable, lasting peace.\u201d In his opening address, Ramaphosa at the start of the G20 meeting of foreign ministers at Nasrec, Johannesburg, on Thursday, Ramaphosa called for calm during the heightened rising intolerance, conflict, climate change as well as energy and food insecurity across the world. He added that it was important to prioritise coordinated responses to meet these problems. \u201cThe nations of the world look to the G20 for leadership on the most pressing issues confronting our world. Just as cooperation supported the progress of early humans, our modern-day challenges can only be resolved through collaboration, partnership and solidarity,\u201d he said. He called on global leaders to unite and adapt to changing times as they look for solutions to geopolitical tensions. Ramaphosa urged leaders to focus on inclusivity in global decision-making, adding that the G20, which represents two-thirds of the global population, must work towards consensus in responding to these crises. \u201cThat is why South Africa has placed solidarity, equality and sustainability at the centre of our G20 presidency. We would like our G20 presidency to be one in which all voices are heard and in which all views count,\u201d he said. Outlining priorities for South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency, Ramaphosa placed strong emphasis on climate change, debt sustainability, just energy transition financing and the responsible use of critical minerals for inclusive economic growth. He highlighted the urgent need to enhance disaster resilience and response efforts, particularly in developing nations disproportionately affected by climate change. Ramaphosa also raised concerns over the rising cost of borrowing in emerging economies, which has significantly curtailed domestic development. \u201cMore than 3.3 billion people live in countries where interest payments on debt exceed education or health spending. The G20 needs to renew its efforts to advance debt sustainability, with a particular emphasis on African countries,\u201d he said. On climate change, Ramaphosa said major polluting nations must be at the forefront to support those least responsible for global warming. He called on the\u00a0 G20 leaders to reach an agreement on increasing both the quality and quantity of climate finance directed towards developing economies. \u201cThis includes strengthening multilateral development banks, enhancing and streamlining support for country platforms such as the Just Energy Transition Partnership, and leveraging private capital more effectively,\u201d he said, adding that global pollutants had caused the Earth to heat above the 1.5\u00b0C limit set by the 2016 Paris Agreement. Ramaphosa said there was a need for green industrialisation and investment in critical minerals beneficiation to ensure sustainable economic growth. \u201cSouth Africa will seek to take forward the recommendations of the 2024 report of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Ivan Timofeev: Here\u2019s why US sanctions can\u2019t ruin Russia-India trade relations \u2014 RT India",
        "text": "By Ivan Timofeev, programme director of the Valdai Club. One of the primary goals of the extensive sanctions imposed on Russia by the West following the start of Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine was to isolate the Russian economy. This has been partially successful \u2013 sanctions have severely hampered Russia\u2019s trade with Western nations. Exports of dual-use items, industrial goods, and various luxury items to Russia are now prohibited. Key components of Western imports from Russia \u2013 such as oil, coal, precious metals, and diamonds \u2013 have also been restricted. Financial sanctions have significantly limited transactions in US dollars, euros, and other currencies of the countries initiating sanctions. Logistical challenges and price caps on oil and petroleum products have indirectly raised supplier costs. Nevertheless, Russia is actively fighting against its isolation by developing relationships with friendly countries. And India plays an important role in this respect. It\u2019s clear that the risks for Indian businesses that engage with Russia are currently relatively low, thanks to India\u2019s diplomacy, the unique nature of India-Russia trade, and the cautious approach adopted by Indian companies. However, these risks are escalating due to the increased probability of secondary sanctions. New legal mechanisms for secondary sanctions emerged in 2023-2024, and a growing number of Indian companies fell under restrictions related to their dealings with Russia in the second half of 2024. The specific risks vary by sector. In the field of military-technical cooperation, risks had begun to surface even before the Ukraine conflict. In 2017, Section 231 of the US federal law known as the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act\u201d (CAATSA) established a framework for secondary sanctions against purchasers of Russian arms. These sanctions were applied to China and T\u00fcrkiye. However, they were quite limited and primarily targeted specific officials and agencies involved in acquiring Russian weapons systems. Notably, India, as the largest buyer of Russian weapons, has not faced such sanctions, thanks to the firm stance of the Indian government that prioritizes national security over potential sanction risks. Additionally, Washington has been reluctant to jeopardize its relationship with New Delhi amid rising competition with China. However, this \u201cgun on the wall\u201d could still \u201cgo off\u201d in the future, as American arms suppliers are keen to engage with India and might leverage sanctions as a competitive advantage. Regardless of this, Russia will remain an important arms supplier to India for years to come, particularly considering the widespread testing of Russian weapons in the conditions of a major armed conflict. In the field of financial transactions, risks escalated substantially in December 2023 when former US President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14114. This order empowered the US Treasury to impose blocking financial sanctions or restrict correspondent banking accounts for foreign financial institutions facilitating deals involving the Russian defense industry and certain dual-use items. In June 2024, the US Treasury clarified that this may also include transactions with Russian banks that have been sanctioned by the US, due to their ties to Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary economy.\u201d Although Washington has mostly refrained from applying this provision against Indian banks, it remains a means of psychological pressure. Banks in friendly nations have become increasingly cautious about financial transactions related to Russia. In the near future, the US Treasury might block several banks in countries allied with Russia to demonstrate the enforcement of this regulation. While dealing in local currencies somewhat alleviates the issue, these transactions still fall under Executive Order 14114, keeping financial institutions on edge. One potential solution lies in developing a banking ecosystem specifically designed to handle transactions with Russia, which would be prepared for being blocked by the US. The growth of such ecosystems is an almost inevitable response to the sanctions. A long-term strategy for mitigating risk involves creating independent financial transaction mechanisms, though this goal hasn\u2019t been achieved yet. In the realm of energy and food cooperation, the situation is more favorable. Financial transactions related to energy deals are partially exempt from US sanctions. However, the price cap on oil poses challenges for oil carriers and suppliers. For carriers, there are risks of secondary sanctions and criminal or administrative penalties in the jurisdictions of the sanctioning countries. Suppliers face pressure on oil and petroleum product prices. Nonetheless, this price cap does not fundamentally hinder the flow of energy resources to the Indian market. The same can be said for food transactions. Some of them are currently exempt from sanctions. However, it\u2019s important to note that these exemptions could be revoked at any time, making the development of independent financial systems, insurance, logistics chains, and other frameworks a pressing necessity. Additionally, risks are increasing for Indian intermediaries and suppliers involved in exporting and re-exporting industrial goods and dual-use items, particularly those containing Western components, to Russia. In the latter half of 2024, a growing number of Indian companies fell\u00a0under such sanctions. Notably, companies\u00a0such as\u00a0Innovio Ventures, Pointer Electronics, RRG Engineering, Shreya Life Sciences, Abhar Technologies and Services, Denvas Services, and Emsystech have faced blocking sanctions due to alleged electronics supplies to Russia. Companies such as KDG Engineering and Shaurya Aeronautics have been sanctioned for supplying electrical equipment and other goods to Russia. Meanwhile, Khushbu, Lokesh Machines Limited, Sharpline Automation, Shreegee Impex, Galaxy Bearings, and Orbit Fintrade faced sanctions for machinery supplies. However, these companies seem to be small players that are not systemically important for Russia-India trade, and it is likely that they will be replaced by others. Moreover, there are fewer such companies from India compared to those from other friendly nations. According to the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), since the start of Russia\u2019s military operation, 207 companies from China (including Hong Kong), 104 from T\u00fcrkiye, and 101 from the UAE have fallen under secondary US financial sanctions. Although India, with its 25 sanctioned companies, has surpassed Switzerland and Singapore (25 and 22 companies, respectively). Indian companies are quite cautious about dealings that are directly or indirectly within the US jurisdiction. This is evident from the fact that only several Indian companies have faced administrative or criminal investigations by the US authorities for intentionally or unintentionally circumventing sanctions. Criminal investigations involving Indian individuals are extremely rare. In the past 15 years, the US Treasury has investigated only Godfrey Phillips, an Indian tobacco supplier that exported products to North Korea through third countries. Some transactions were conducted in US dollars, which led the US Treasury to hold the Indian company accountable. No other similar instances have emerged. In contrast, American companies, their subsidiaries, as well as companies from the UK and the EU are scrutinized much more frequently. We can expect the US to exert increasing pressure on India and Indian businesses, aimed at creating barriers and increasing costs associated with trade with Russia. However, this pressure is insufficient to halt bilateral trade or prevent its potential growth in the future, since it is impossible to impose a complete blockade on a major economy like Russia\u2019s.

        "text": "The UK and EU must be involved in a peace settlement in Ukraine, which includes putting boots on the ground, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said following talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington. The US has recently initiated peace talks with Russia, sidelining both the EU and UK. Starmer met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, where they discussed a plan to reach an enduring peace in Ukraine. \u201dThe European countries, including the United Kingdom, need to play a full part in that,\u201d Starmer said in an interview on Fox News. London will play \u201ca leading part,\u201d he insisted, whether it\u2019s \u201ctroops on the ground\u2026 or possible air, maritime work\u201d together with the EU. The UK and France have previously said they are prepared to deploy peacekeeping troops to Ukraine to secure any peace deal with Russia. Trump has indicated, however, that Washington has no plans to send US forces to support a European-led peacekeeping mission, arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin can be trusted to not breach the eventual agreement. Moscow has opposed the deployment of unauthorized troops to Ukraine, warning that without a UN mandate, they would be considered legitimate targets. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the idea of deploying foreign troops to Ukraine is being pushed primarily by France and Britain, suggesting that this is meant to \u201cfurther fuel the conflict and stop any attempts to cool it down.\u201d The Foreign Ministry also accused the EU and UK of embarking \u201con a path of militarism.\u201d Britain has been a steadfast supporter of Ukraine since the conflict escalated three years ago, providing substantial military aid and implementing stringent sanctions against Russia. As of February, London has committed nearly $10 billion in military assistance to Kiev. RT News App \u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

        "text": "The EU is instigating regional conflicts and fueling turmoil in a bid to reclaim its diminished global influence, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin has stated. Vulin made the remarks in an interview with RT on Friday while commenting on the Ukraine conflict and the EU\u2019s exclusion from the US-Russia peace talks. He also touched on the growing regional tensions. \u201cThe EU has completely lost its position as a superpower,\u201d he said, arguing that the bloc no longer has a place \u201cat the table\u201d with the US and Russia on key global issues such as the Ukraine conflict. \u201cHow can you reclaim your position as a great power?\u201d Vulin continued. \u201cBy trying to make some kind of turmoil, trying to create some kind of conflict that you can control, and that\u2019s it.\u201d He pointed to recent anti-government protests in Serbia and the conviction of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik by a court in Sarajevo as examples of the EU\u2019s efforts to maintain its influence. \u201cThey must show that they\u2019re capable of doing something like that,\u201d Vulin said. Reflecting on the EU\u2019s sidelining in peace negotiations, he added: \u201cYou see what happens when you are not free. You don\u2019t have your own politics \u2026 Someone else tells you what you should do.\u201d The Serbian deputy prime minister also criticized Western support for Ukraine, calling it \u201ckind of strange\u201d that the \u201cso-called democratic governments are pro-war.\u201d He recalled a recent remark by US President Donald Trump that the conflict between Moscow and Kiev should have been avoided in the first place. Trump has blamed Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky for failing to resolve the hostilities, saying he had years to do so and adding that he \u201cshould\u2019ve never started it.\u201d According to Vulin, Russia and the US should work toward an agreement to restore peace, but he questioned the EU\u2019s role in ending the conflict. He also accused the West of \u201chypocrisy\u201d over sanctions, suggesting the EU might face a dilemma if Trump moves forward with plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. European politicians, particularly French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, were strongly against Trump during the US election campaign but are now travelling to the White House. \u201cThey called him all these different names \u2013 idiot, fascist, corrupt, et cetera, et cetera. Putin puppet and who, God knows who else,\u201d he said, questioning their current approach and describing it as \u201cclash of ideology.\u201d Trump, Vulin added, is capable of telling them: \u201cTry to clean up your own mess.

        "text": "The US Justice Department (DOJ) and FBI have launched a criminal investigation into alleged fraud in the $20 billion climate grant program introduced by former President Joe Biden, the Washington Post reported on Friday. The probe follows President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201croot out waste, fraud, and abuse\u201d in government spending. The investigation centers on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, established under Biden\u2019s 2022 climate law to finance clean energy projects and managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The probe was reportedly launched after the EPA\u2019s newly appointed administrator, Lee Zeldin, publicly alleged that the money from the fund was disbursed with insufficient oversight. \u201cRoughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA,\u201d Zeldin said in a statement on February 13, pledging to \u201creview every penny that has gone out the door.\u201d \u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d he stated, adding that his agency would try to reclaim the money from Citibank, which was tasked with disbursing the funds. According to the Washington Post, citing sources close to the investigation, the probe has so far been fraught with challenges. While the DOJ has the authority to freeze assets, it can only do so when it has evidence that they can be traced to a crime. Last week, it approached Denise Cheung, a top DC federal criminal prosecutor, to submit a warrant request to freeze the funds. However, Cheung resigned rather than carry out the order, arguing that the DOJ lacked evidence. Subsequently, the department had Trump-appointed attorney Ed Martin personally submit the seizure warrant application, but was denied by a magistrate judge who cited a lack of probable cause. Efforts by acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove\u2019s office to launch a grand jury investigation and seek a court-ordered bank freeze were also rebuffed by prosecutors. While it is not clear whether a warrant was granted after all, at least three organizations that received money from the fund reported that their Citibank accounts have been frozen without explanation, according to the news outlet. In the most recent development, FBI agents have reportedly questioned EPA employees regarding the fund earlier this week. The probe has drawn criticism from Democrats, with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse calling on Zeldin to cease efforts to reclaim the funds, arguing that his actions are illegal. Legal experts have also questioned the DOJ\u2019s approach. Stefan D. Cassella, a former federal prosecutor specializing in asset forfeiture, described the situation as \u201cextraordinary and probably unprecedented,\u201d stressing that seizing funds without probable clause is illegal.

        "text": "Admitting Ukraine into the EU would be an\u00a0\u201cunthinkable\u201d act,\u00a0Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stated, adding that accession to the bloc by Kiev could have\u00a0severe economic and security consequences for Hungary. Speaking in an interview with Kossuth Radio on Friday, Orban said that while he would not rule out Ukraine joining the bloc in principle, doing so under the current circumstances would be virtually impossible. \u201cOne thing I can say for sure: here and now, this is unthinkable,\u201d he said. He argued that Ukraine\u2019s membership in the EU \u201cwould ruin us,\u201d adding that \u201cfirst, it would destroy Hungarian farmers and Hungarian agriculture. Second, it would subsequently ruin the entire Hungarian national economy.\u201d Beyond economic concerns, Orban claimed that Ukraine\u2019s accession would lead to an influx of crime into Hungary. \u201cI also don\u2019t see clearly how we will curb the crime that would inevitably flood into Hungary along with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot think of a single argument that would justify Ukraine\u2019s accession from Hungary\u2019s perspective.\u201d Orban has been a consistent critic of Ukraine\u2019s integration into Western institutions, although he argued in 2023 that the EU could sign a five- to ten-year strategic partnership agreement with Kiev to bring it closer to the bloc. He has also pushed back against Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions, warning that its accession could escalate tensions with Russia, and suggesting that the country should instead remain a \u201cbuffer\u201d between Moscow and the West. Ukraine applied for EU membership in February 2022, shortly after the escalation of the conflict with Russia. In June 2022, it was granted candidate status. However, Ukraine faces significant hurdles before joining the bloc, as full membership requires the unanimous approval of all EU nations. In addition, the EU has demanded that Ukraine implement a comprehensive set of governance reforms, fight rampant corruption, and harmonize its legislation with EU law. EU officials have never set a definitive timeline for Ukraine\u2019s accession, although former European Council President Charles Michel suggested that Ukraine could join the bloc by 2030, provided it meets all the conditions.

        "text": "Elon Musk has backed claims that Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros is spending millions of dollars in an attempt to block US President Donald Trump\u2019s political agenda. The accusation comes after the US Republican Party narrowly passed a budget blueprint on Tuesday in the House of Representatives, leading to concerns that the outcome of an upcoming race for a seat in the Wisconsin Supreme Court could shift the balance of power. On Thursday, former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker claimed in a post on X that Soros has been trying to influence the Wisconsin vote in order to give the Democrats the upper hand in Congress. \u201cDo the math. The vote on Tuesday night was 217-215. George Soros is pulling millions into the WI Supreme Court race because a 4-3 liberal majority will redraw Congressional districts to squeeze out 2 GOP seats,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThis is how he blocks the Trump agenda.

Musk agreed with Walker on Friday, writing that derailing Trump\u2019s agenda \u201cis exactly [Soros\u2019] goal.\u201d The Wisconsin Supreme Court race features two candidates: Susan Crawford, who is backed by the Democratic Party and has received donations from Soros, and the GOP\u2019s Brad Schimel \u2013 a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and former Republican attorney general who has been supported by Musk. Soros and Musk have both invested significant sums into the respective candidates and both sides have accused each other of trying to buy a seat on the Supreme Court. Crawford has criticized Musk\u2019s involvement in the race, suggesting that the billionaire was trying to further an \u201cextreme agenda.\u201d Meanwhile, Schimel has expressed concerns over Soros\u2019 influence, citing his support for \u201cvery dangerous ideas\u201d such as defunding the police. According to a survey conducted by the Institute for Reforming Government late last month, Schimel is leading in public opinion polls, with 40% of registered voters supporting the GOP candidate compared to 35% saying they would vote for Crawford.

        "text": "Polish MP Slawomir Mentzen has accused Ukrainian journalist Vakhtang Kipiani of publicly threatening his life for criticizing Ukraine\u2019s obsession with World War II Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera. Earlier this week, Mentzen, a candidate for the right-wing Confederation Party in the upcoming Polish presidential elections in May, had traveled to the Ukrainian city of Lviv where he recorded a video in front of a monument to Bandera. In the clip, he likened Bandera to a \u201cterrorist,\u201d recalling that the Nazi collaborator had been sentenced to death by a Polish court for being responsible for the murder of some 100,000 Poles. The video also suggested that having monuments honoring Bandera was akin to building monuments commemorating Adolf Hitler. \u201cUkraine must abandon the cult of Bandera as soon as possible,\u201d Mentzen urged. In response to the video, Kipiani issued a post on Facebook ridiculing Mentzen and suggesting that the Polish MP was \u201cdreaming of the glory of Pieracki,\u201d referring to the minister of internal affairs of interwar Poland, Bronislaw Pieracki, was murdered in 1934 by members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), of which Bandera was a part of. \u201cWe can do it again,\u201d Kipiani wrote. Mentzen fired back at the Ukrainian journalist, accusing him of threatening to kill a Polish MP. \u201cUkrainians once again show their attitude towards Poland,\u201d Mentzen wrote on Facebook, suggesting that Kiev only wants money from Poland while it continues to honor the murderers of Poles. The lawmaker\u2019s Confederation Party also condemned Kipiani\u2019s death threat, adding in a statement on social media that it had found out that the Ukrainian journalist\u2019s website, which \u201cglorifies the UPA and is a mouthpiece for nationalist Ukrainian propaganda,\u201d had been co-funded by the Polish government. Both Mentzen and his party have now called on the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the situation to prevent further attacks by Ukrainians on Poland and its citizens. Bandera, a member of the OUN militant wing, was one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) during World War II. The group allied with the invading Nazi Germans and carried out massacres of Poles, Jews, Russians, and Ukrainians whom they accused of collaborating with the Soviets. Despite the group being accused of committing genocide, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko declared Bandera and the UPA national heroes in 2010. The Polish government has taken particular issue with the celebration of Bandera in Ukraine, as the UPA is believed to have murdered between 40,000 and 120,000 ethnic Poles in the regions of Volhynia and Eastern Galicia.

        "text": "Russia and the US have identified steps they both should take to restore normal operations of their diplomatic missions, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow has said, following negotiations in T\u00fcrkiye. Russian and US delegations met in Istanbul on Thursday, as the two nations seek to heal a diplomatic rift that deepened under the previous administration of President Joe Biden. The discussions centered primarily on reinstating regular operations at the US Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Embassy in Washington, with the two sides identifying \u201cconcrete initial steps,\u201d as previously noted by the US State Department. In a statement on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry emphasized that normalization must be a two-way process. Both nations have imposed various restrictions on each other in recent years, including limiting the number of diplomatic personnel, constraining banking access, and seizing diplomatic properties. Moscow argues that its sanctions are a direct response to actions taken by Washington. The delegations were led by Aleksandr Darchiev, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s North Atlantic department, and Sonata Coulter, US deputy assistant secretary for Russia and Central Europe. Darchiev is set to become Moscow\u2019s next ambassador to the US. In a separate statement on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said he had received US agreement for his appointment during the talks on Thursday, and is set to travel to Washington soon. The ministry stressed the importance of achieving \u201cpractical results for improving bilateral relations in the interests of our peoples.\u201d As part of this effort, Russia proposed restoring direct air traffic between the two nations. In 2022, the US suspended flights and closed its airspace to Russian airlines, acting alongside other Western nations in response to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. Travelers have since relied on airlines from neutral countries, routing through locations such as T\u00fcrkiye and the United Arab Emirates. US President Donald Trump has shifted away from many Biden-era policies, including attempts to \u201cisolate\u201d Russia. His administration is seeking a swift end to the Ukraine conflict. Trump has labeled Kiev\u2019s aspirations for NATO membership unrealistic. Moscow views the military bloc\u2019s expansion in Europe and its promises to eventually admit Ukraine as key factors fueling the ongoing conflict.

        "text": "A German court has convicted and sentenced\u00a0two Afghan men to years in prison for planning to attack the Swedish parliament to revenge Quran burnings in the country. They were found guilty of supporting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and conspiracy to commit murder, the Thuringian Higher Regional Court said in a statement on Thursday. Ibrahim MG, aged 30, was sentenced to five years and six months in prison, while Ramin N., 24, was given a sentence of four years and two months, according to the court document. \u201dThe defendants, who entered Germany in 2015 and 2016, identified with the ideology of the so-called Islamic State (IS),\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey shared IS's worldview and supported the violent approach of this terrorist organization,\u201d it added. According to the court, the defendants planned the attack in response to Quran burnings in Sweden. They intended to use firearms to kill members of parliament and people who would oppose their attack. The men researched locations in Stockholm, travel routes to Sweden, and ways to acquire weapons online. The suspects, who had been monitored by law enforcement, were arrested in March 2024 after attempting to acquire firearms on the black market in the Czech Republic. Apart from planning the attack, Ibrahim MG, who was a member of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), a regional branch of IS, transferred money to aid the women and children of IS militants in a refugee camp in Syria, the court added. In determining the sentence, the court considered the defendants\u2019 confessions and the fact that they had no previous convictions. The verdict is not yet final as the Federal Court of Justice will have to decide on an appeal. Sweden has witnessed a spate of Quran-burning incidents in recent years, with similar protests taking place in neighboring Norway and Denmark. The incidents led to angry protests in several Muslim-majority countries. Swedish authorities have condemned the burnings, but still largely allowed them to go ahead, citing the country\u2019s laws guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression. Many Muslim-majority countries have condemned the incidents as Islamophobic, and T\u00fcrkiye even threatened Sweden with blocking its NATO accession plans. Ankara later ratified the bid however, and the Nordic country was formally admitted to the US-led military bloc in March 2024. Stockholm said in 2023 that it planned to amend the Public Order Act in order to prevent Quran-burning incidents in the future. However, no legislative changes have been implemented to date.

Whether we can pursue a similar arrangement with France or Britain is a question I want to address in coalition talks and with our partners in Europe, the EU, and NATO,\" Merz emphasized. He also noted that he had not yet discussed this matter with French President Emmanuel Macron during his recent visit to Paris, particularly regarding whether Germany should rely not only on the U.S. but also on support from Paris and London for nuclear deterrence. According to Merz, the French proposal to explore a common nuclear umbrella for Europe is not a new idea. \"Now the situation has changed again, and therefore we should reconsider this issue together,\" he stated. At the same time, the CDU leader pointed out that \"articles 4 and 5 of the NATO Treaty concerning consultation and assistance remain unchanged, meaning that Germany\u2019s nuclear cooperation with the Americans continues as before.\" \"But here too, let us hope for the best while being prepared for the worst,\" Merz concluded.",

According to it, the communique will say that negotiations on Ukraine are impossible without Ukraine and negotiations on European security are impossible without the participation of Europe. The document will also say that any comprehensive peace agreement must be accompanied by reliable security guarantees for Kiev.

Earlier, EU Council President Antonio Costa scheduled an emergency EU summit for March 6 to discuss assistance to Ukraine and European defense. He also said that talks between French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump, would be discussed at this meeting. On February 12, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the prospects for resolving the conflict in Ukraine by phone. According to the Kremlin, Trump called for an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful solution to the problem. Putin emphasized the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with the US leader that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations. Later, Putin noted that the European Union states could participate in the negotiations, but they cannot force their way into this process. He said that Moscow had been in constant discussions with European countries, but they chose to disengage.",
