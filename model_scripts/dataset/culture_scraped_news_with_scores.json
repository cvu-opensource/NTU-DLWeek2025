        "title": "Questions still remain for BBC after damaging Gaza documentary",
        "text": "As guests sat down on the red cinema-style seats in the screening room of a plush central London hotel, nobody could have imagined that, less than a month later,  the BBC would find itself forced to apologise for serious and unacceptable flaws in the documentary that was about to be shown. In the darkness, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone unfolded over an hour, telling in bleak and upsetting detail the story of Gaza's children over recent months of the war. Screenings are standard practice for media companies, primarily for outside press to review a programme ahead of broadcast. Also in the room was BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and other senior executives from the BBC's news and current affairs to view what one described as a \"landmark\" piece of filmmaking. But after the programme went out on BBC Two, it emerged that the child narrator at the heart of the film, 13-year old Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas government official. The outcry and accusations of anti-Israel bias and lack of transparency led the BBC to pull the film from iPlayer. Questions were asked in Parliament. Criticism continued about the programme's subtitling choices – including contributors using the Arabic word for \"Jews\" on camera, which was translated in the subtitles as \"Israelis\" or \"Israeli army\". Some argue that the BBC covered up antisemitism. Others have claimed the subtitles are closer to what the speaker intends rather than a literal translation. After an initial investigation, the BBC said the programme, which had been commissioned by the BBC and made by an outside production company, \"fell short of our expectations\". It launched a further review headed by the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He will look at whether editorial guidelines were broken and whether anyone should be disciplined. It's a reputationally damaging mess, but how could it have happened? How did the commissioners of the programme not know that the child narrator's father was a deputy minister for agriculture in the Hamas-run government? The BBC says it had asked the production company \"a number of times\" in writing during the making of the film about any connections he and his family might have with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others. In a statement on Thursday the BBC said Hoyo Films, the maker of the film, acknowledged it \"never told the BBC this fact\". But what did it tell the BBC about the child? Crucially, the BBC failed to uncover the information itself. Embarking on a documentary about one of the most polarising and contested issues of our age was always going to be challenging. The talented director at Hoyo, Jamie Roberts, has won an Emmy award for his film about the evacuation of Kabul. He's award-nominated for a powerful documentary about the events of 6 January in the US. He also made a searing film for the BBC about the Ukraine war. But he hadn't directed a documentary set in the Middle East before. He was working with the Palestinian journalist, Yousef Hammash, whose Gaza reporting for Channel 4 has won him a Bafta and an Emmy last year. The BBC commissioners in current affairs will have known the programme wasn't without risk. In circumstances like this, it's even more difficult to understand how the failings that have driven headlines for days - and done terrible damage to the BBC's reputation - could have occurred. Programme-makers and commissioners have previously told me they draw up risk grids to ensure they have the answers to any criticism thrown at them about their documentaries. They check and check and check to ensure they won't face problems after their programmes go out - or if they do, that they have the counter-argument ready. Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs until 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Media Show she would have done her own checks rather than relying on the independent company. \"If I was making this film, I wouldn't just ask who the boy was, who his father was, who his mother was, I would ask for the entire family tree. They could easily have found out about him, it shows that due diligence was not done. \"I didn't wait for people to inform me of things,\" she added. \"I asked them the right questions.\" Byrne says in her view the film isn't \"pro-Hamas\". Watching it, I was struck by the efforts at balance. It contains voices who curse the leaders of Gaza. One of the children followed by the documentary, 11-year old Zakaria, says he doesn't like Hamas \"because they started the war, they caused all this misery, this is wrong\". A woman says \"they are causing us harm\". There's a conversation about why taking Israeli civilians hostage is wrong. But we also see the horrors and violence of what's taken place in Gaza -  through the eyes of children. Zakaria, who hangs around the hospital to help the paramedics rather than remaining with his family because, he says, there's no food and water where they are, tells the camera he thinks he's seen 5,000 dead bodies. Renat who's 10 and is building up a social media presence with an online cookery show, describes drones that shoot bullets. She smiles and laughs wildly on camera, as she describes, still clearly traumatised, how a bomb just exploded right next to her as she was walking outside her apartment. As the press release put it, the documentary is an \"unflinching and vivid view of life in a warzone\". It's the kind of programme Turness said, as the BBC apologised, that her department \"should be doing\". But she added \"Of course we have to get it right.\" The BBC brand is based on impartiality - on being trusted around the world. All of us in news and current affairs take fact-checking very seriously. Mistakes are sometimes made, of course. But on this occasion both the independent production company and the BBC made serious errors which threaten trust in the corporation. Since joining the BBC as head of news in 2022, Turness has prioritised transparency to grow trust. Not informing viewers about the child narrator's family story is the opposite of transparent. She will have trusted the experienced BBC commissioners who oversaw the programme to do the appropriate due diligence. They will have trusted the filmmakers and the executive working with them. This isn't the end of the story and questions still remain. What exactly did the BBC ask about the boy and his family's potential connections to Hamas? Hoyo Films has said it's \"co-operating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made\". There's also the question about exactly how much was the \"limited sum\" paid for the young narrator's work - and whether that money ended up in the hands of Hamas. Yesterday in Parliament, Lisa Nandy said she had sought assurances from the BBC that it hadn't. The scandal comes in a week in which the BBC already was apologising over its failure to tackle behaviour by the DJ Tim Westwood - after a separate review that cost more than £3m. What's happened has damaged trust in the BBC in so many ways. Those who argue the corporation is biased against Israel will feel vindicated. Leo Pearlman, co-CEO of the major British production company Fulwell 73, told us on Radio 4 that the BBC has \"gaslit the Jewish community\" in the 16 months since October 7th and that this documentary parroted 'the propaganda of Hamas\". For others who view the BBC as having anti-Palestinian bias, the decision to pull the documentary and apologise will confirm their beliefs. Artists For Palestine, which includes Gary Lineker, Anita Rani, Riz Ahmed and Miriam Margolyes, says the claims about the identity of the child's father are \"misleading\" and that to conflate his \"civil service role\" with terrorism is \"factually incorrect\". The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians has lodged a formal complaint against the BBC for taking down the documentary and \"suppressing the testimony of Palestinians\". It says the deputy minister for agriculture's role involves \"food production relating to crops, fishing and livestock\". What's unfolded since the programme's broadcast is unlikely to change minds on any side. The losers in all this are the young citizens of Gaza. The stories of the children in this film - and the suffering they have endured - aren't now being seen. Hoyo Films said it believes \"this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard\". The BBC has made clear it has no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer. The Greenock-born actor says that despite liking life in the US, nothing beats his hometown. Borderlines is taking place across Shropshire, Herefordshire, Malvern and the Welsh borders. Cinematographer Lol Crawley reflects on how his childhood in Wales inspired him into the film industry. Producers say they want stories \"only someone from Bridgwater would know\" to help make a new film. The strippers, dancers and actresses of Anora give us their take on the film's realism - and its limits. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Is Young Spencer the Shankill's answer to Kneecap?",
        "text": "On the other side of west Belfast's peace wall, Young Spencer is rapping about subjects similar to Kneecap. Like them, he references drugs, paramilitaries and identity. But - it's told from a totally different perspective to the famous (and infamous) Irish language hip-hop trio. While Kneecap wrap themselves in the Irish tricolour, in one of his songs Young Spencer continually talks about the red, white and blue of the Union flag. Yet recently they shared a stage in the city and thousands of Kneecap's fans sang along with a man who describes himself as proud to be British. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, the rapper said his appearance in front of the sold-out SSE Arena crowd was about bringing communities together based on more than just their religion. \"At the end of the day, to me that was more so about the unification of the city,\" he said. \"Yes, you're from the Falls and I'm from the Shankill, but it's more so about this city that we come from.\" He said when the west Belfast rap trio first reached out about performing at their show in December there were nerves. \"There's just as much reason to say no as to say yes, and people would go 'why is that? It's the biggest opportunity of your life',\" he added. \"You are still driven with fear as much as you are driven with love, and you're still worried that people aren't receptive to where you're from and when you're talking about greatness and moving the city forward and the country forward as a whole. \"Maybe some people won't understand Kneecap and Young Spencer on the same stage until 20, 30 years' time, but that's ok because what's supposed to be understood will be understood.\" Young Spencer is the alter-ego of Gareth Spence, who during the day works in a school in Belfast. He was raised on the Shankill Road, which he admits saw guns, drugs, paramilitaries and division during many troubled years in Northern Ireland. But living there has been in his own words \"a gift\" as well as a curse. Now 30 years old, he got into rapping as a teenager after getting therapy, and said personal traumas have influenced his music. \"We're all reporters... we have a responsibility to speak on these issues and be a voice for the voiceless and we will always be a voice for the city. \"Real change happens and I feel like that's what the show represented more than anything.\" Gareth said we can't be shy of acknowledging that there is always likely to be division. Yet he believes more is shared across Belfast's working-class areas. \"A lot of people have this sort of warped opinion of the communities that we're from too, whether it be the Shankill or the Falls, anywhere in Belfast because they go back to this troublesome period from 30 years ago and they still stay stuck in that. \"But you'll find unification in so many ways and so many different forms now in the city than you ever have.\" The rapper said we're \"a lot closer to peace now than we've ever been\". \"There will always be division of some extent, we will never get away from that completely because that's life and not everybody likes each other and that's just plain and simple,\" he told Good Morning Ulster. \"But everybody has the right to be identified as who they identify as. \"My thing is that being a proud Protestant, being from Belfast, being from the Shankill, doesn't take away from them being proud Catholics and being from west Belfast and being from the Falls Road, why can't we unite?\" Across Young Spencer's social media platforms is the acronym P.R.O.D - but it is used more so as a set of principles to live by rather than a label. \"Passion, persistence, respect, resilience, opportunity to overcome, dedication, determination,\" he explained. \"You can look into the colours and identify my background, pick here and there and do whatever you want, but that's the core set of values and principles that got me to where I am here today and help me keep living my dream.\" So what's next for the Shankill's son? \"Inspire to inspire, motivate to motivate. Persisting with my passion when they chose to hate,\" he said. \"Respect is earned, resilience is where I was raised, opportunity comes, overcome and make your name. Determined and dedicated to making a change and that's P.R.O.D.\" You can listen to the full interview with Young Spencer on Good Morning Ulster on Friday.. A Derry girl band who supported Snow Patrol say it was one of the biggest nights of their lives. The programme includes performances, conversations and an exhibition with a sound installation. Burton Chapel Records co-founder Isra Rodriguez says the industry is shifting towards smaller labels.

        "title": "‘I am changed in every cell of my body’: what surgeon Gabriel Weston learned when she faced serious illness at home | Doctors | The Guardian",
        "text": "First the doctor was diagnosed with a heart disorder, and then her son became dangerously unwell … How did it feel to be on the other side of the operating table? Nothing thrills me more than the human body. But, until my mid-20s, it didn’t cross my mind that someone like me could become a doctor. There were no medics in my family. I was slow at maths and science, and gave them up before the age of 16. After school, I decided on an English degree, because it was what I found easiest. Then, in my final year, something important happened. A few of us were hanging out at a friend’s house one evening when his dad, a surgeon from London, arrived to stay for the weekend. Over dinner, we all sat enthralled as he told us stories of his hospital life. He fetched a surgical textbook from his bag, full of photos of some of his favourite operations, and I remember sitting at the kitchen table late into the night, poring over these luminous images, skin peeled back to reveal muscle and bone, tumours and blood vessels. It was my first glimpse of real anatomy, and I was astounded by its beauty. After graduation, unhappily employed as a clerical assistant in a publishing house, I heard about a new course being pioneered at one of the big London medical schools. A professor there had a hunch. Maybe the usual stock of candidates with perfect science scores weren’t the only ones who could make good doctors. What if there was a hidden population of arts students out there, overlooked because they didn’t have the right qualifications, who could be trained to do the job just as well? Before I knew it I had quit my job and was joining nine other unlikely would-be doctors to become the second cohort of the Foundation Course in Natural Sciences, my single biology O-level making me, in that professor’s words, the least-qualified medical student in the country. The deal he was offering was tough but miraculous. We would join first-year students of maths, physics, chemistry and biology for their lectures and exams. Anyone able to pass all four subjects at the end of the summer term would get a place at medical school. The years that followed were some of the happiest of my life. It wasn’t until years into my training, by which time I was trying to combine a career in surgery with new responsibilities as a mother, that I started to feel some of the constraints as well as the joys of my profession. The more clinical medicine I learned, the less it made sense to me to regard the body as a purely mechanical entity. All too frequently, I saw surgeons disregarding the feelings of their patients. Standing next to my consultant one day while he yanked out staples from a woman’s abdomen, showing little consideration for her distress, I found myself thinking back to that radical anatomy professor. Surely, when he was dreaming up a way to bring an arty bunch of kids into the conventional world of medicine, he had something more in mind than simple camouflage? He must have hoped we had something fresh to offer, that we might doctor differently than our more traditional peers? I began writing with a simple desire, to honour the opportunity that professor gave me, to set out on an exploration of anatomy, which – by blurring the boundaries that usually separate science from art, rational from emotional, objective from subjective experience – might help me arrive at a deeper and more complete understanding of what we’re made of. But then serious medical events in my own life changed everything. At precisely the point I might have expected to become intimately in touch with my physical self, I found myself disoriented. Just when I thought being a doctor would be most useful, I felt powerless. When I was finally able to return to writing, I knew that I needed to find a way to convey something of the messy and frightening experience I now had of living inside a human body, one which had suddenly become a text for other doctors to read. We are first-year medical students and testing our new stethoscopes. My boyfriend’s is bright red and stands out like an artery against his immaculate white coat. We’re by the window in his flat, sun flashing on the river, and when I lean in, though it’s his heart I’m supposed to be listening to, it’s really mine I’m aware of, racing and skipping the way it sometimes does, especially when I get this close to him. When it’s his turn, he listens for ages. And his face is so rapt when he looks up that, for one foolish moment, I expect romance. Instead, he says: “I can hear a murmur. There’s something wrong with your heart.” From: GWeston To: nurse@nhs.com Subject: patient/dr with new symptoms Date: Sunday 31 October 2023 Dear Adult Congenital Heart Disease Team, I am a longstanding patient of Prof. A, having been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse as a medical student more than 20 years ago. I’ve been under routine review since, with no worsening of my heart condition in that time. Over the last week, I’ve developed recurrent and prolonged palpitations, unlike anything I’ve had before. I’m thinking of phoning for advice first thing tomorrow. Please let me know if I should be taking more urgent action. Kind regards, (Dr) Gabriel Weston If you make a fist with your left hand and press knuckles against the reassuring solidity of your breastbone, you delineate the approximate size and position of your heart. It doesn’t make sense to imagine this organ still, when its defining feature is the heartbeat, a phenomenal physiological event which occurs 100,000 times a day, delivering 5,000 gallons of oxygen-rich blood to every fibre of our bodies. The heart is no inert lump of flesh, but the hub of a vast network of 60,000 miles of arteries and veins, two distinct but interconnected circuits held together in one snug embrace. The right side of the heart is in charge of the pulmonary circulation. Veins laden with oxygen-depleted blood from around the body all converge and empty into the right atrium. This is also home to the sinoatrial node, which generates the heart’s electrical power. Contracting when full, the right atrium pushes blood through a little door called the tricuspid valve – so named because of its three leaflets – into the right ventricle. Then, the right ventricle squeezes blood out of the heart and towards the lungs, and the tricuspid valve closes, preventing backflow into the atrium. The systemic circulation is managed by the left heart. Oxygenated blood from the lungs pours into the left atrium until it’s at capacity, sending its contents through the mitral valve, into the left ventricle. As the left ventricle starts to pump newly minted blood out and around the rest of the body, a healthy mitral valve will slam shut, preventing blood leaking back into the left atrium. But in someone with a floppy valve like mine, one or both leaflets overshoot, like the swinging doors in a saloon bar after a cowboy has made his showy entrance, allowing blood to regurgitate into the left atrium. For a cardiac patient, conceiving of the heart as an electrically charged pump doesn’t require a leap of faith. I regularly have a series of investigations, to see whether the abnormal backflow of blood through my heart is bad enough to warrant surgery to correct my mitral valve. Once a year, an envelope containing a Holter monitor lands on my doormat, and I stand in front of the mirror fastening electrodes to my chest, clipping the recording device to my waistband, happy to think of thousands of my heartbeats being traced while I go about my business. Every six months, I lie down in a shadowy hospital room, while an echocardiographer applies jelly and a probe to my chest, and maps the incremental progression of my disease, the usual quiet lub-dub amplified to a Niagara-like roar, my errant mitral valve flapping around on the grainy screen like a loose piece of washing on a line.

Did I imagine something going wrong with my own body was the worst thing that could happen? How can I describe this, the crease around which my life is folded? A headache is all there is at first. My son says it is manageable mostly, but sometimes really painful. Like on standing: one, two, three bang. Or on sitting up from lying down. It’s 10 days or so before I begin to worry. And even then, it takes a change to wake me up. First day of the school holidays and it’s cut-glass perfect outside. And yet my teenage son is still in bed at lunchtime, room ablaze with sunshine, skateboard accusing him from the carpet, no phone in hand. Get out of bed, I think. Get up or there’s something really wrong. If you hold a brain in your hands, it looks solid and inscrutable, but it’s really the organ of ultimate flux, information shooting like stars from one hemisphere to the other, between lobes, from one gyrus to the next and across trillions of synapses too tiny for even the microscope to see. All of this is made possible by a rich blood supply. Internal carotid arteries bring blood to the front of the brain. The basilar artery supplies the back of the brain, and the two systems form a circuit that goes round and round. Venous blood collects in deep grooves called sinuses and these all drain to the internal jugular veins, and down to the heart. The operational unit of the brain is the neuron. Thinner than a human hair, each of these consists of a cell body, dendrites and an axon. Dendrites branch out, like fronds of seaweed, and receive electrical messages from hundreds of other neurons. These travel to the cell body, which contains genetic material in its nucleus, where a decision is made about whether a signal should travel onwards. Outgoing electrical messages are conducted down the axon to its tip, where little sacs open and empty neurotransmitters into the synapse, the space between one neuron and another. These chemicals are taken up by receptors on the dendrites of the receiving neuron. And so the process continues. Dexamethasone for swelling. Blue light across town to where the sick kids go. Wheelchair down corridors, up lift and home to a ward with a cuddly name and no stinting on Christmas decorations. Straight to bed, legs curled up, too tall for the colourful cot. A welcome tour: our very own fridge, the coffee room and shower, a quick lesson in how to fold the armchair down to make a bed. But don’t sit just yet. Come now and meet him. Serene neurosurgeon, sleeves rolled up against infinite work. The room is tight with no good news. Won’t see his next birthday, whisper the walls. The monitor flickers. I’ll get out what I can, he says. But first I need more scans. The neurosurgeon comes to find me on the ward. We go into the corridor and sit by the computer. For comparison, he shows me yesterday’s CT. I angle my face to the screen but blur my eyes. I don’t want to see it any more. Then he clicks on the MRI. I prepare myself to hear that my son’s spine is as full of tumour as his brain. The surgeon flicks through images, axial and coronal sections. He credits me with more medical knowhow than I am capable of. This ventricle, that lobe, this vessel, all the details collapse before my eyes. But then he stops on one picture and something inside me wakes up. The mass appears different here. It’s clean-looking, cartoon-bright. He has to repeat himself several times, before I hear what he’s explaining to me. Cancer doesn’t have this appearance on an MRI. This isn’t a tumour, it’s blood. They say we’re safe to go home. We bring the Christmas tree in from the garden where we left it, still in its corset of netting. The hospital leaflets lie next to the box of fairy lights. Cavernomas are abnormal clusters of blood vessels, one tells me. I put the tinsel on. They occur in the brains of one in 600 in the population, but only cause symptoms in one in 400,000 a year. I hang the papier-mache decorations the kids made when they were small. Seizures and brain haemorrhage are the two most serious consequences. These cavernomas present surgeons with a perilous dilemma: is it riskier to take them out or leave them alone? A month later I stand at the top of the driveway and watch him getting smaller. In the quiet morning, the only sound is the roar of wheels on asphalt. He’s thinner than he was a month ago, and I am too. He’s a bit shaky on his skateboard, as I feel shaky in my heart. His hood is up, concealing what lies underneath, a soft white dressing and below that a narrow shaved strip and five-inch wound, black with blood and stitches. As for me? I am changed in every cell of my body. I think of all that I’ve learned from books about the brain and the things I’ve seen in the past few weeks that I never thought I’d see. And I bring my scattered mind to stillness on one point, which is the brain’s limitless capacity for fresh knowledge, for repair, for life. In the distance, he attempts the tiniest of jumps, feet barely breaking contact with the board. And for the first time, I dare to imagine he’ll soon be up to his old tricks again. I am not the same person I was and my body isn’t the same body. So, what has this time – in which I’ve added becoming a patient and the parent of a patient to my medical credentials – revealed about how we practise medicine? We proceed on the basis that our facts are right, though it only takes a glance at medical history to realise they may soon be out of date. Our western healthcare systems persist in an outdated, post-industrial assumption that the body is a mechanical apparatus, when there is abundant medical evidence that our physical and emotional selves shouldn’t be separated. If we’re serious about improving our NHS, we have to take pause. We should teach medical students that any anatomy that doesn’t take account of the person is false anatomy. We need to persuade managers who force doctors and nurses to work like machines that human bodies aren’t automata, that individual stories matter. We must provide doctors and patients with enough time to talk. For at no point are we more ourselves, or more adrift from ourselves, than when we are ill. That said, it’s taken becoming a patient to show me there are limits to how much we should expect even the best doctors to truly know us. I can say not a day goes by when I’m not grateful for the brain surgery that saved my son’s life. I can tell you I’ve made peace with the long wait for heart surgery, with my cardiologist’s view that – though my mitral valve inevitably will need to be repaired at some point – the right time for that is not now. But that’s not the sum of it. There remains an essential contradiction in medicine. To care for a patient, you have to step away from them. Knowledge and being can’t be fully reconciled. Is this why my desire to fathom the human body remains as fierce as on that first day at medical school, why moments of revelation don’t tend to come when, as a patient, I’m flooded with the primary experience of my own failing body – nor when, as a surgeon, I step up to the operating table, tense with information – but somewhere in between, standing in a colleagues’ theatre, or at some other momentous medical event, when all that’s required of me is still observation, heartfelt attentiveness, a kind of quiet bearing witness?

        "title": "Family of woman killed by man with psychosis criticise English prison and policing ‘lapses’ | Prisons and probation | The Guardian",
        "text": "Coroner says failures contributed to Stephen Cole’s killing of Marta Elena Vento at a Bournemouth hotel The family of a woman killed by a man with psychosis have said she “paid with her life for lapses in the English prison and policing system” after a coroner said failures by prison and police authorities contributed to the killing. In a damning verdict, the senior coroner for Dorset, Rachael Griffin, said Marta Elena Vento, 27, a Spanish national, was unlawfully killed by Stephen Cole in December 2020 while she was working as a receptionist at a Travelodge hotel in Bournemouth. In the summer and autumn of 2020, Cole had been on remand in Winchester prison for indecent exposure. He attacked two fellow inmates and two staff members, one of whom needed hospital treatment. He was assessed by prison psychiatrists, who judged he had psychosis or possible paranoid schizophrenia and was prescribed olanzapine, which stabilised him. The healthcare services were run at the prison by a private health provider, Practice Plus Group (PPG). Cole was unexpectedly released on 27 October 2020 with only a month’s worth of the medication. After it ran out, he attacked two people at the accommodation where he was staying and was placed in the Travelodge where Vento worked by his family after he was evicted from another hotel where he had been placed by the housing authority. On 9 December, Cole punched, kicked and attacked Vento with hair clippers. The attack lasted for 42 minutes, in which Vento sustained 55 injuries. She later died. Recording a narrative verdict on Friday, Griffin said: “Marta Elena Vento was unlawfully killed by another who, at the time of her death, was unmedicated for a diagnosed mental health illness because of a failure to sufficiently plan and ensure the continuity of his mental healthcare upon his release from prison six weeks prior to Martha’s death, and because he was not adequately managed as a sex offender in line with national guidance on his release from prison.” After the hearing, Vento’s family issued a statement. “Today’s conclusion confirms what we have suspected in the four long years since our dear Marta was torn from our lives,” it said. “It is overwhelmingly hard for us to understand how the English prison health system could allow someone like Stephen Cole, who was so clearly unwell, to be released without a care plan and the ongoing medication he needed. “It is equally hard for us to understand why the English police did not make themselves fully aware of the danger Cole posed when he stayed at the Travelodge on that night. “Our daughter paid with her life for lapses in the English prison and policing systems. The cost to our family can never be measured. Without our Marta, our lives will never be the same.” In her concluding remarks, the coroner said that a discharge summary was not sent to Cole’s GP upon his release from prison, nor was there a referral to the mental health team to continue his care. “At this time, there was no integrated mental health policy in place within the healthcare department of the prison,” she said. “There was a lack of comprehensive care planning infrastructure across prison healthcare nationally and the prison healthcare team were experiencing pressures arising from reduced staffing following the mobilisation of the healthcare contract at the prison and the impact of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.” Griffin said Cole was given medication upon release from prison, but there was no “continuity of the mental health care” and it soon ran out, leading to a relapse of psychosis. Dorset police’s team dealing with violent and sexual offenders was responsible for managing Cole in the community, the inquest heard. Griffin recorded that there was “incomplete information gathering to identify, assess and manage his risks in the community, and no Armss [at-risk mental state service] risk assessment was completed or management plan put into place in respect to the perpetrator prior to Marta’s death”. The inquest previously heard that just before the attack, Cole told a police offender manager he was being spied on through the smoke alarms at the Travelodge and people were knocking on his window, though he was on the fourth floor. Also, shortly before, Cole’s family arranged for him to see a GP to try to get more olanzapine but the doctor said he was not able to without details from those who had prescribed it. In 2021 Cole pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility due to a psychotic episode and was given an indefinite hospital order.",

        "title": "Almost half of England’s councils ‘could face bankruptcy over £4.6bn deficit’ | Local government | The Guardian",
        "text": "Damning National Audit Office report says action is needed to address deficit accumulated under Tory-era policy Almost half of councils in England risk falling into bankruptcy without action to address a £4.6bn deficit amassed under a Conservative-era policy, the government’s spending watchdog has warned. In a damning report, the National Audit Office said that rising pressure on public services and repeated delays to reform the funding of local government meant town halls were in an “unsustainable” financial position. It highlighted failure to reform the funding of special educational needs and disabilities (Send) as one of the most worrying areas where the resources were being outstripped by spiralling costs. The previous government had introduced a scheme known as the “statutory override” which allowed councils to temporarily keep Send debts off their balance sheets – in effect papering over the problem. However, the override was planned to end in March 2026, by which point the accumulated deficit for all councils in England is expected to have reached £4.6bn amid ballooning pressures on local authorities. The government says it is in the process of developing a long-term solution. However, the NAO warned failure to address the problem by next March could leave 43% of local authorities at risk of declaring effective bankruptcy. The independent spending watchdog said council funding in recent years had increased but not kept up with demand or complexity of needs. After years of austerity under the Conservatives, more councils in England have declared effective bankruptcy in the past three years than the preceding three decades. While funding from central government grants, council tax and business rates had increased by 4% between 2015-16 and 2023-24 to almost £56bn, funding per person had fallen during the same period by 1%. Over that time councils also made deep cuts to discretionary services – such as libraries and road maintenance – while raising spending on adult and children’s social care, which now accounts for 58% of total spending. Earlier this month ministers announced a financial settlement worth more than £69bn for the coming financial year, alongside a sweeping devolution package to reorganise the structure of local government. A form of bailout was also approved for 30 councils, and six were granted permission to raise council tax by more than the usual 5% cap. The NAO said projections show that funding per person is set to increase by 7% by 2025-26. However, the Local Government Association estimates that councils will still face a funding gap of up to £8bn by 2028-29. Gareth Davies, the head of the spending watchdog, said: “There have been repeated delays to local government finance reform and government can no longer resort to short-term solutions to support local authorities. Action to address this must resolve the systemic weaknesses in local government financial sustainability through a comprehensive, cross-government approach.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “This government is under no illusions about the financial issues facing councils. That’s why we’re reforming the funding system and delivering improved public services across the country.”",

        "title": "Coroner warns about NHS physician associates after misdiagnosis and death of woman | NHS | The Guardian",
        "text": "Pamela Marking, suffering severe stomach issues, diagnosed in hospital with nosebleed and sent home by PA A coroner has issued a warning about the role of physician associates in NHS hospitals after a woman with severe abdominal problems was wrongly diagnosed as having a nosebleed and died four days later. The family of Pamela Marking, 77, were under the mistaken impression she had been seen by a doctor when she was examined in an emergency department, rather than a physician associate (PA) with far less training. Surrey assistant coroner Karen Henderson has written to 12 health leaders or bodies including the UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, and NHS England expressing concerns about the “limited training” PAs have and the lack of public understanding about their roles. In a preventing future deaths report, Henderson said Marking was taken to East Surrey hospital in Redhill on 16 February last year after she vomited blood-stained fluid and had a tender abdomen. The coroner said the PA who saw her had “a lack of understanding of the significance of abdominal pain” and sent her home the same day. Marking deteriorated, returning to the hospital two days later. She underwent surgery for complications arising from a femoral hernia but died on 20 February 2024. Henderson said the PA had acted independently in the diagnosis, treatment, management and discharge of Marking without independent oversight by a medical practitioner. The coroner said: “Given their limited training and in the absence of any national or local recognised hospital training for physician associates once appointed, this gives rise to a concern they are working outside of their capabilities.” The coroner said the term physician associate was misleading to the public. “Mrs Marking’s son was under the mistaken belief that the physician associate was a doctor [and] no steps were taken by the emergency department or the physician associate to explain or clearly differentiate their role from that of medically qualified practitioners.” Henderson added that the lack of public knowledge about PAs “has the potential to hinder requests by patients and their relatives who would wish to seek an opinion from a medical practitioner”. At the end of Marking’s inquest last year, Henderson concluded the clinical management she had on her first visit to hospital – and later the issues with anaesthesia when she was operated on – “materially contributed to her death”. In November, the UK government ordered a review of the role of PAs in the NHS, amid growing alarm in the medical profession about patient safety. It will examine the safety of their roles and how patients should be made aware that, despite their titles and ability to diagnose illness, they are not doctors and can only perform certain tasks. About 3,500 PAs and about 100 equivalents in anaesthesia – called anaesthetic associates – are working in hospitals and GP surgeries in England. PAs can take a patient’s medical history, conduct physical examinations, analyse test results, diagnose illnesses and help draw up the plan for managing a person’s condition. They do two years of medical training, far less than a doctor. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Philip Banfield, the chair of the BMA council, said: “Mrs Marking needed care from a doctor, because they are specifically trained in more depth and more widely to consider a diagnosis that may not be obvious at first sight. “As the coroner says, the continued blurring of the lines between PAs and doctors is compromising patient safety. A government review is ongoing but this tragic case already shows it must result in nationally agreed safe scopes of practice for these assistant roles.” A spokesperson for Surrey and Sussex healthcare NHS trust said: “We will continue to look carefully at the details of this case to ensure we learn any lessons. “Physician associates follow a nationally recognised programme of training and work within a very specific scope of practice under the direct supervision of a consultant, as was the case here. All of our physician associates wear designated scrubs with their job title, physician associate lanyards, and use the recommended introduction of their role when meeting patients.” An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS has always been clear that physician associates are not replacements for doctors and should only practise with appropriate medical supervision, but there remain legitimate concerns about the roles and so the [government-ordered] review will gather insight from across the NHS to ensure they are being used appropriately.” This article was amended on 27 February 2025.

        "text": "Wife drove two hours to try to alert prison after attempting to raise alarm on phone line that did not work A woman who drove 60 miles to Wormwood Scrubs to prevent her husband from taking his own life in prison was unable to alert staff in time because the telephone line and the intercom were both broken, a coroner has ruled. Isaiah Adekunle Olugosi killed himself in his cell at HMP Wormwood Scrubs in March 2022. A jury found that his death was suicide.\n Olugosi’s wife spoke to her husband at about 9pm on 27 March and believed he was suicidal, according to a prevention of future deaths report by Richard Furniss, an assistant coroner for west London.\n Olugosi’s wife, Cambridgeshire police and the Metropolitan police were all unable to contact the men’s prison in west London by telephone to warn them because “calls were being diverted to an unmanned or obsolete number”. Instead, she drove for two hours from Cambridge to Wormwood Scrubs where she banged on the main gate for some time, calling out and pressing a buzzer which promised to connect her to an intercom through which she could speak to prison staff, the hearing was told. Furniss said in his report that the intercom was out of action and had been “for several years”. As a result, Olugosi’s wife and police could not contact the prison all night and Olugosi killed himself. Furniss ruled “there is a risk that future deaths will occur” unless the Wormwood Scrubs governor, Amy Frost, takes action. He said: “The buzzer intercom system must have been provided because it was thought important to provide that additional means of communication between the prison and the outside world. “In this case, a working system would have enabled the deceased’s wife to warn the prison of his impending suicide. “It is difficult to understand why the intercom system has not worked for several years.” Furniss added: “There was evidence that it is irreparable. But the proposed solution appeared to be either to leave it as it is or to remove it altogether. It is a matter of concern that the prison and the Ministry of Justice still considers that it is unnecessary.” Frost has been asked to respond to Furniss’s report by 21 April with details of measures taken or proposed action to be taken. In 2014, prison inspectors said spending cuts had reduced Wormwood Scrubs to a filthy, overcrowded and dilapidated state. Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons at the time, said his office found that the jail had “declined in almost every aspect”. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We will carefully consider the coroner’s findings and will respond to the report in due course.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

        "text": "Independent review also calls for ban on other ‘legal but harmful’ material that is degrading, violent or misogynistic Pornography depicting strangulation should be made illegal along with other kinds of “legal but harmful” sexual material, according to an independent review for the UK government. The recommendation is one of 32 made by the Conservative peer Gabby Bertin, who was commissioned by the former prime minister Rishi Sunak to scrutinise the industry in 2023. Lady Bertin also recommended banning the possession, distribution and publication of other degrading, violent or misogynistic pornography, as well as the prohibition of “nudification” apps. Choking during sex is becoming increasingly normalised, with one survey showing nearly four in 10 women aged 18 to 39 have experienced it. Bertin said pornography had always been a fact of life, but in recent years its scale and impact had “transformed dramatically” owing to online distribution. “The evidence is overwhelming that allowing people to view legal but harmful pornography like choking sex, violent and degrading acts, and even content that could encourage child sexual abuse, is having a damaging impact on children and society,” she said. “The law needs to be tightened with more proactive regulation of online platforms.” Bertin’s review said non-fatal strangulation or “choking” sex had already been criminalised under the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act and should therefore be added to the definition of extreme, illegal pornography. Responding to the report, government ministers said “graphic” strangulation pornography was already illegal but they would take “urgent action” to address the problem. However, Bertin said there was no case law to support the government’s argument that strangulation pornography was in effect banned under the 2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act. “I am not confident that its inclusion is clear,” she said, adding that the Obscene Publications Act should be updated to include choking material. This would remove any legal ambiguity over the issue, she said. The review has been published days after the UK communications watchdog published measures to tackle online misogyny, including tackling explicit deepfakes and “revenge porn”. Pornography is viewed regularly by more than a quarter of the UK on social media and pornography sites. According to the UK communications watchdog, Ofcom, men are twice as likely as women to visit a pornographic site. Other recommendations from the review include making pornography that depicts incest illegal, creating an ombudsman for victims of intimate image abuse, and banning people who upload illegal material online from uploading material on to platforms. The UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said on Thursday he would not hesitate to “adapt the law” to prevent people from accessing degrading pornography online. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme before the publication of the review, he said: “I know that this content is harmful to many of the people who currently have free access to it. We have the powers to prevent people getting the access to it, even if the material is provided from elsewhere. “We just need to find ways of making sure that that is done efficiently and effectively. And if I have to adapt the law in response to any gaps that emerge in these powers then of course I’ll act as swiftly as I can.”",

        "title": "‘It makes me less lonely’: LGBTQ+ group thrives in England’s straightest place | Sexuality | The Guardian",
        "text": "Data from the 2021 census spurred one man to help gay people in Rochford, Essex to feel more accepted When Rochford was crowned as England’s straightest place in the 2021 census, it weighed heavily on Chris Taylor’s mind. Taylor, a Rochford native who is 36 and gay, was not surprised. He had grown up in the rural and traditionally conservative stronghold where, he recalls, conversations and recognition of gender identity outside heterosexual norms were “nonexistent”. So he decided to do something about it. After running for Rochford councillor and MP last year with the Green party, Taylor decided to start a Facebook group for the LGBTQ+ community in January. It has since grown to 97 members and has ambitions to one day host a local pride event. “I know there are going to be people out there against it,” said Taylor, who added that the group had already received some hateful messages. “But they can’t dictate to us that we can’t be who we want to be in our community.” In the 2021 census, the district of Rochford in Essex was shown as the straightest place in England, after only 1.6% of the population identified as LGBTQ+. By contrast, in Brighton and Hove, one in 10 people over 16 identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or of another sexual orientation. Across England and Wales, the percentage of those who identified as gay or lesbian or bisexual was 2% and 1.8% respectively, according to the 2021 census figures. While some members of the newly formed Rochford District LGBTQ+ group feel people may have been less open to answer the census question honestly, Rochford, with a population nearing 86,000 in 2023, is also home to an older population, with a median age of 46. Census data has previously shown significant correlation between sexual identity and age, with younger areas having more LGBTQ+ people. Bev Danby, 64, was compelled to join the local group because there was nothing else like it. Aside from the recent negative responses in the group, Danby said she had only ever had positive experiences living as a gay woman in the area. “It makes me less lonely,” said Danby of the group. “If you’re a gardener, you join a gardening group. If you’re a walker, you join a walking group. If you’re gay, you join a gay group. What is wrong with that?” She was one of nearly a dozen members of the newly formed group who met in Rochford for the first time in early February. While many in the group identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community, others identify as allies for their children who are navigating their own identities. Some members questioned the census figures, admitting to declining to answer honestly, while others spoke of the lack of LGBTQ+ visibility in the area, including gay bars, that had previously led them to feel less accepted. In 2016, James Edmunds left Essex at the age of 18 for London as he found the area “very homophobic” and “unaccepting”. He had found a community in London, and returning to Rochford he was glad the new group had formed, with new allies and friends he had’t known were there. “Coming back five years later, I’ve seen the town and the area change so much in such a positive way,” said the 26-year-old. The feeling was similar for Rosie Williams, 30, who had not anticipated returning to Essex after moving away for university. “I didn’t think I’d ever come back to Essex because I never really felt like I belonged here,” said Williams, who works for the mental health charity Mind, which will be helping provide services to the group. Had the group existed sooner, Williams said she probably would have come out earlier, and been more accepting of her identity. “Once I moved here, I did feel worried about being able to find a community and actually feel safe in my identity because of the politics of the area,” said Williams, who recently moved back to Rochford. Having access to the group had made her feel less afraid, she said, adding that when out with her partner she would often survey their surroundings and wonder if they would be safe holding hands. “It’s scary being gay at the moment,” she said, citing the political rhetoric around trans identity, as one example. “Fascism is back in fashion. It’s a scary time to be on the fringes of society.” When Mary Holmes first came across the group on Facebook, she was thrilled. Holmes, 33, works as a population health nurse for the NHS in Rayleigh, within Rochford. Her role focuses on community outreach to address health inequalities, but reaching the LGBTQ+ community has been difficult for Holmes, who relies on data, including that from the census or how people register with their GP. “I was so excited because I’ve been looking for you guys for so long. Because people identify differently, or might not feel comfortable putting things, the standard ways of searching for people doesn’t come up with anything and it’s very difficult to reach out,” she said. A primary focus for Holmes was making others in the community aware of the lived experiences of those who identified as LGTBQ+, she said. “There are people out there that want to support, that want to educate and learn and I think that’s why it’s so important to try and grow these groups.”",

        "title": "‘This moment is medieval’: Jackson Katz on misogyny, the manosphere – and why men must oppose Trumpism | Violence against women and girls | The Guardian",
        "text": "The result of the US election unleashed a ferocious feminist backlash, he says, and makes his 40-year struggle to end violence against women more urgent than ever ‘If it takes a village to raise a child, it also takes a village to raise a rapist,” Jackson Katz says. “Perpetrators aren’t individual monsters; they are people reflecting a system. We need to address that system.” For the past 40 years, the researcher and activist has been advocating that violence against women be treated as a men’s issue. He works across the US in universities, schools and the military to encourage men to speak up when they encounter misogynistic behaviour in their peer groups. Katz believes that it is only through boys and men holding themselves accountable for their behaviour that violence against women can end. Since the re-election of Donald Trump, he believes his work has become more urgent than ever. “The election has been a complete catastrophe – it was a huge setback for the prevention of domestic abuse and violence,” Katz, 60, says from the book-lined study of his home in Massachusetts. “Seventy-seven million Americans voted for Trump after he was found liable for sexual abuse in Manhattan and ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages. The jury’s verdict is undeniable. By voting for someone with that history, it has a normalising effect on his behaviour. It’s unleashed a firehose of misogyny.” The consequences have included funding cuts for gender-based work and an attack on the mandate set out in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. “Trump and Elon Musk’s Doge [Department of Government Efficiency] team is freezing funding for swathes of non-profits, including many of those that should be protected by the Violence Against Women Act,” he says. “They’re getting rid of DEI [diversity, equality and inclusion] initiatives and anything with the keyword ‘woman’ is coming under scrutiny. People who work in the area are stunned and despairing. This isn’t a normal moment – it is medieval and a huge rollback of progress.” Katz has also witnessed a louder and more forceful chorus of young men promoting misogynistic ideals; online, he is often called a “virtue-signalling cuck” or a “beta male”. “There’s an assumption that young people are more left-leaning, but we are seeing the opposite right now and it’s very worrying,” he says, referencing the fact that 56% of 18- to 29-year-old male voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 40% of women in that bracket. “We’re witnessing a global backlash against women’s progress, since the past 50 years have seen unbelievable challenges to patriarchal norms. Trumpism and rightwing populism isn’t a revolt against the ‘elites’; it’s a reaction to men being de-centred and a backlash against feminism. Trump has been marketing himself with the men’s movement and it’s fuelled the manosphere from being an abusive men’s rights subculture to becoming the mainstream. We on the other side need a bigger microphone to get into the conversation – we each need to stand up and say ‘not in my name’, since people like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson [who has argued that ‘the masculine spirit is under assault’ and that the patriarchy ‘might be predicated on competence’] have platforms with millions of followers being indoctrinated.” Driven by that mission to reach a wider audience, Katz has written a book, Every Man: Why Violence Against Women Is a Men’s Issue, which outlines the ways that men can and should involve themselves in the fight against gender-based violence. He believes it may be the first time a major commercial publisher has released a book about men’s violence against women that has been written by a man. “It’s shocking to me, because you can go as far back as John Stuart Mill writing a critique of marital rape in 1869 to see how men have been talking about the issue,” Katz says. “We have been doing this work for a long time and the book is a toolkit for other men to get themselves involved. It’s our moral, ethical and human duty to help women in this struggle together.” Katz was born in a small town north of Boston in 1960. He says he was brought up in a “jockocracy”, where social life and status revolved around American football and basketball. His biological father was a second world war medic and medical sociology professor who died while Katz’s mother was pregnant with Katz. Her second husband, the man Katz grew up with, was a blue-collar factory worker and truck driver: “A very tough, old-school guy who wasn’t very communicative,” Katz says. In high school, Katz became a star football player and was celebrated in his parochial, male-dominated culture. He describes witnessing “generalised misogyny” as a teenager, but it wasn’t until he went to college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst that he began to learn the extent and pervasiveness of the problems faced by women and marginalised people. “It was the 70s and my mind was expanding on issues of racism, sexual assault and the women’s movement. I found it all so interesting,” he says. “I started seeing how gender was one of the primary organisers of our society and, as I developed an interest in changing the world around me, it felt like the issues with gender needed to be addressed first. I was enjoying such freedom as a young man, walking home drunk late at night and not worrying about myself while my female hallmates were always thinking of their safety.” Katz’s columns for the student newspaper became increasingly concerned with sexism and the Reclaim the Night protests that were occurring across campus. “I was inspired by these women who were standing up for their rights and safety,” he says. “That’s when I decided to speak out, too. It was as simple as that.” Katz signed up for gender studies classes and eventually became the first man in the history of his college to minor in women’s studies. After graduating, he began working in grassroots gender campaigning, founding the anti-sexist men’s group Real Men in 1988. Was it really simply attending college classes and protests that turned Katz from his working-class, sports-dominated male culture towards feminist campaigning? “I get asked all the time if something has happened to me to set me on this path. I have women close to me who have been assaulted by men, but it’s not just a personal experience,” he says. “I took those classes because I wanted to learn how to have better relationships with the people around me and in the process I realised how gender-based violence affects everyone. Violence begets violence and the same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse men. I came from a position of influence as a straight, white man and sportsperson, so I felt I had to speak up to try to break the cycle.” What did his peers think about his shift into activism? “Mainly people thought I was a little weird,” he says, laughing. “But they couldn’t write me off, because I had been part of their culture and that was the key. They knew me, so in some way they had to listen.” Attempting to change the culture from within became a tenet of Katz’s work with Real Men and, later, with his Mentors in Violence Prevention programme. Enlisting role models from professional sports and the military, Katz began running workshops and training programmes to encourage changes in behaviour from the top down in male-dominated organisations. “I’ve long been convinced that lots of men are uncomfortable about their peers’ behaviour, but are scared of speaking out because of losing social status or facing retribution,” he says. “By getting role models talking about it, especially people like male athletes, who have a higher status, we can make other men feel comfortable to speak out when they see or hear something sexist, as well as bring these ideas to men who might never have considered their role in gender-based violence before.” Gaining the ability and confidence to interrupt sexist behaviour from men is the main purpose of Katz’s book. Written in a conversational, largely jargon-free tone, it is intended as a practical toolkit for men to think about ways in which they can challenge difficult behaviour, with each chapter ending with a section on “how you can make a difference” that outlines lines of argument and conversation. Katz covers the history of men’s work in this space from the 1970s onwards, arguments against victim-blaming and men’s defensiveness when it comes to taking responsibility; he advocates against watching pornography, an industry that he says “legitimises misogynist abuse by normalising sexualised brutality”. He ends by analysing the “manosphere” and online groups that are influencing schoolchildren to support outspoken misogynists such as Tate. A “how to” book tackling an issue as entrenched and systematic as gender-based violence may seem a futile response, but amid the guidance Katz lays out a strong argument often accompanied by shocking statistics. He refers to the World Health Organization statistic that almost one-third of girls and women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, while one in seven children have lived with domestic abuse. “It’s much more comforting to see the people committing these acts as monsters. We can dissociate ourselves from them, then we don’t have to be introspective,” Katz says. “It’s easier if rape is a pathological behaviour, but if we think about how we might be perpetuating a culture that produces rapists, it forces a level of introspection that makes people very uncomfortable. That introspection leads to action and choices about how we can change our lives.” One method that Katz has helped pioneer in his career is the bystander approach – initially employed as a tactic against school bullying, where peers are encouraged to step in and support the bullied child, rather than leaving the onus of responsibility solely on their shoulders. Katz began running workshop scenarios where men would think through their ethical obligations when faced with sexist or potentially abusive behaviour by one of their group. “Men would walk in with their arms folded, saying they didn’t need to be there because they weren’t abusers, so I would say: ‘You don’t abuse girls or women, but what are you doing to help others who are abusing them?’” Katz says. “It’s leadership training, since it takes nothing to be one of the boys, but it takes courage to stand up for what is right. It can be scary, relationally and physically, to challenge someone, and people push back when you upend the status quo, but your silence is telling them that it’s OK. Those men would walk out with their minds changed. I want it to be required training across the board, from schools to colleges, sports teams, workplaces and beyond.” Since there are almost 400 million guns in circulation in the US, Katz emphasises that his approach is not to engage in potentially dangerous public interventions, but rather to focus on “known peer cultures” like friends, teammates and co-workers. “People don’t speak in those situations, because of social fear, but by framing the guy who speaks up as a strong man, or a good friend, you’re making it positive and aspirational, which has more likelihood of success,” he says. “The most important aspect is making sure those in positions of power speak up the loudest and that our leaders are confronting the issues, too, as that is where widespread change can happen.” With the most powerful political leader in the world in the process of opposing much of what Katz advocates, he emphasises the need for persistence and bravery from bystanding men – a show of leadership in the absence of a leader. “We can’t tell boys that bullying is bad and then equally reward bullies like Trump in power,” Katz says. “There’s a lot of fear in the face of a rightwing populist government, but we need men to loudly oppose him, otherwise real people will be harmed. We’re living in a different world now and it’s urgent.” As the father of a grownup son, Katz says his main responsibility is to be a role model for young people and to provide a platform for their voices. “We owe it to the next generation of boys and girls, who haven’t chosen to be born into this patriarchal society,” he says. “Challenge your peer groups, educate each other and make sure your voice is louder than those spreading abusive norms. It takes courage, but it will only cause more tragedy if we don’t show it.” Every Man: Why Violence Against Women Is a Men’s Issue (Penguin, £10.99) is out now.

        "title": "Labour’s revolution of local government will be seismic but won’t be straightforward | Richard Partington | The Guardian",
        "text": "Bucket-loads of political capital and cash will be used to reconfigure English councils’ two-tier set-up, but the benefits could be huge Across England a quiet rebellion is brewing. In Rutland, locals have started a campaign to save the tiny county from abolition. Villagers in High Peak, rural Derbyshire, worry they could be bundled in with Andy Burnham’s Greater Manchester. Nottingham is expanding, Medway wants to become a city, and Surrey will have a mayor. Flick through your local newspaper (if one still exists), or fight past the online pop-ups and chances are there will be a story about Labour’s plans for the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s. Under the guise of a “devolution revolution”, championed by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, work is under way to merge hundreds of English district councils with the counties above them, creating a single layer of unitary authorities. Local leaders must submit plans by 21 March. The idea is to find efficiency savings to tackle the worst town hall financial crisis in decades, after years of austerity-driven cuts. The so-called mega councils will also underpin the creation of dozens of new, mayor-led strategic combined authorities, with powers in areas including transport and economic development. Many people will hardly notice, particularly in London and other big cities, where unitary councils and mayors are already the norm. The national media, too, have mostly focused on the Westminster fight between Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage, after this May’s local elections were deferred for a year in some places, rather than the detail of the English devolution white paper it stemmed from. The devolution revolution will not be televised. But make no mistake, the changes are seismic. Piece together the parochial media reports and a big national story emerges: more than a third of England’s population – about 20 million people – will be affected, in a shake-up literally redrawing the map. For Labour, the plans are unfinished business. In 1969 Harold Wilson’s government published the Redcliffe-Maud report, whose proposals were aimed at sweeping away 1,300 councils and replacing them with 61 unitary authorities. But the unexpected loss of the 1970 election, to Edward Heath’s Tories, led to the much less ambitious 1974 Local Government Act. John Prescott tried again, when New Labour sought to establish elected regional assemblies through a series of referendums, only to abandon the idea after voters in the first poll, in the north-east, rejected it. In this third attempt, Rayner is leaving little to chance. Building on the mayoral authorities created by George Osborne – including in Manchester, Liverpool, and the West Midlands – makes clear sense, and so Labour is filling in gaps on the devolution map without relying on referendums. Last year’s general election landslide is viewed as enough. However, it is clear that Labour will expend bucket-loads of political capital in this hyper-local battle. People in areas neighbouring bankrupt councils – including Woking in Surrey and Thurrock in Essex – are understandably worried that the changes will lead to higher council taxes and cuts to services. Ministers want the new mega councils to cover populations of at least 500,000 – bigger than Liverpool or Bristol – forcing together disparate areas. After the low-hanging fruit of London, Manchester and other big cities, devolution elsewhere is much tougher. Further progress will require riding over local democracy, and will take years to achieve. Still, the prize on offer is sizeable. England is one of the most centralised countries in the developed world. The hotch-potch of past devolution deals adds up to a messy, unfinished system. Fixing the financial troubles of councils will help them to stop fire-fighting and focus on delivering public services and economic growth. Ministers highlight work by the accountancy firm PwC which estimates a reorganisation of two-tier local government would have an upfront cost of about £400m, but could save £2.9bn over five years. Less spoken about is that scrapping hundreds of small borough planning departments – replacing them with fewer big ones – could hand Labour power to green-light housing in previously intransigent places. However, the government could face accusations that its plans are akin to rearranging the proverbial deckchairs unless a key ingredient required to make devolution a success is forthcoming: cash. Ministers appeared to recognise this fact earlier this month, confirming a financial settlement worth more than £69bn. Last week, bailouts for 30 councils were also approved, unlocking a combined £1.5bn in additional borrowing power. Six councils were also granted permission to raise their council tax above the usual 5% cap. However, much more needs to be done. Rachel Reeves’s forthcoming spending review will be key. The Local Government Association says England’s councils face a collective £8bn funding black hole by 2028-29. Even if reorganisation saves money, the new councils and mayors will still need a cash injection. A report published on Monday from the Association for Public Service Excellence and the Centre for Local Economic Strategies makes this point well. It shows that local government spending per resident in England has fallen steeply after the years of Tory austerity, from £3,628 in 2009-10 to £2,857 in 2023-24, or by 21%, after taking into account inflation. To reverse this would not only create more than 900,000 jobs – mostly in essential roles, such as the fire service, teaching and care – it would have a positive, knock-on effect on the local economy. The report estimates that each job would enable the creation of another, and would spark a £43.6bn economic boost. “To be fair they have given councils much more money short-term, but I think that’s more to patch over the problems than to build a solution,” says Mark Gregory, a professor at Staffordshire University and a former chief economist at the accountancy firm EY who has advised Labour politicians. While the reorganisation of local government could help, more is needed. “Labour’s line is we need growth to invest in public services. But my take is, if you don’t invest in public services, you won’t get the growth anyway.”",

        "title": "The pill hasn’t been improved in years. No wonder women are giving up on it | Martha Gill | The Guardian",
        "text": "When contraception has stagnated for decades, it is hardly surprising it’s fallen victim to culture wars and a wellness cult Something is changing when it comes to contraception. Lots of people aren’t using it. Last week we heard that this includes a third of young Irish people. Meanwhile, there has been a significant rise in abortions in England and Wales. Prescriptions for the contraceptive pill in England dropped from 432,600 in 2014 to 188,500 in 2021. And this month data from abortion clinics found that demand is being fuelled by women coming off the pill and using natural methods instead. When the study compared contraception used by women seeking abortions in 2018 and in 2023, it found that the proportion using smartphones to track their menstrual cycle had increased from 0.4% to 2.5%. The use of hormonal contraception among this group fell from 19% to 11%, while the group not using any form of contraception when they became pregnant increased from 50% to 70%. Why? When it comes to the declining popularity of birth control, two factors are at play. One is a conservative backlash against it, starting in America. Alex Clark, a pro-Trump media personality, has called the birth control pill “poison” and said it will cause “issues with fertility” later in life. She has even suggested it can “falsely make women feel bisexual” – claims that are all untrue. And conservative commentator Candace Owens has denounced the pill and intrauterine devices as “unnatural”. Elon Musk has tweeted that hormonal birth control “makes you fat, doubles risk of depression & triples risk of suicide”. Colliding with this is the wellness movement, which has a history of advising people to treat themselves with “natural” rather than medically proven methods. As the media landscape splinters, individual voices gain power to persuade. Videos on TikTok and Instagram, many exaggerating the side-effects of the pill, gain millions of views. Then there are individual bad experiences that may gain disproportionate attention, giving the impression that birth control is more dangerous than it is. Public health leaders are trying to combat these forces – the NHS has warned that misinformation about the pill on social media, especially a false claim that it causes infertility, is putting women off. But there’s another, underlying problem when it comes to contraception: it needs to improve. Many are deeply dissatisfied with the contraceptives we have. Bad information aside, condoms fail, IUDs are invasive and can be painful to implant, hormonal methods have side-effects such as headaches, weight gain, acne and depression. Of women who take the contraceptive pill, about a third stop in the first year, many due to health concerns and worries about side-effects. The cultural battle over contraception is largely focused on whether people should abandon existing methods, or whether that is irresponsible advice. But there’s another question we should be asking. It’s common for women to be using the same methods as their mothers – or even their grandmothers. Why aren’t contraceptives getting better? There is certainly appetite for new ideas. New products are often greeted with excitement: when Lo Loestrin, a hormonal pill with lower oestrogen, was introduced in 2011, it quickly became popular. But, oddly, there seems to be little appetite for developing it. Research has centred on small improvements to existing contraceptives. There were just 20-25 industry-funded clinical trials between 2017 and 2020, compared with 600 for cardiovascular drugs in 2019 alone. While pharmaceutical companies tend to plough 20% of their sales revenue back into research and development, for contraception it is 2%. Funding is limited, propped up by the public sector. Why isn’t more work being done to improve contraceptives? Part of the problem is that when you give a drug to a healthy population, the safety requirements and litigation risks are higher, which may put investors off. Worldwide, the contraceptive market is still growing, despite dissatisfaction; many women are just accepting the trade-offs. This means there has been no big market signal that things need to change. But the history of contraception reflects the culture at large. While conservative forces are trying to push women off the pill by claiming it is dangerous, it was they who stymied research in the first place. Underlying this, too, is an expectation that women will put up with significant side-effects. As long as contraceptives work, unhappiness is ignored or underplayed. There is hope on the horizon. While women’s contraceptives have stagnated, a new range of imaginative treatments is on the way – for men. One, for example, is a gel that works to block fertility when smeared on the arms and shoulders, without affecting mood or libido. Sign up to Observed Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion While female side-effects are considered acceptable, given they are weighed against the risks of pregnancy, researchers conducting trials do not think men would accept the same bargain. In 2011, a male contraceptive trial was halted when it emerged that side-effects included mood swings and depression – commonly experienced by women on the pill. Nevertheless, the arrival of better contraception for men could make things easier for their female partners who don’t like the options available. Innovations for men could also cross over into solutions for women, as the bar for safety and effectiveness is raised. There is the risk, too, that, as male contraceptives suck up airtime and funding, women’s will continue to fall behind: almost half of pregnancies around the world are unintended – a high proportion of them in places where birth control is accessible.

        "title": "Why are women still being sent to prison as ‘a place of safety’? | Eva Wiseman | The Guardian",
        "text": "Reports reveal the true harm done by incarcerating women under the guise of protecting them Every now and then I learn something about the world today that sticks into me like a fish hook and I find myself asking friends, colleagues, “Wait, did you know this? Did you know this was happening?” The most recent felt like a horror-movie trope. It’s the part of the film, about a third of the way in, where a woman is locked up with the lie that the incarceration is for her own good. It’s not just films, of course, not just fiction – countless women were institutionalised in the 19th century for “abnormal” behaviours, like disagreeing with their husbands, or following “unnatural” sexual impulses. Some were locked up for postnatal depression, some alcoholism, some “moral insanity”, which meant, somehow, infidelity. But what shocked me even more than historical reports on women like Elizabeth Packard, who was incarcerated by her husband in 1860 (the doctor’s reasons included her refusal to shake his hand and the fact that she was above the age of 40), what got me asking, saying wait, was the knowledge that something similar is still happening daily, in prisons across the country. Typically, this is how it goes: a woman on the street behaves erratically and police pick her up, concerned she might harm herself or others. Perhaps she’ll be held in a police car or cell for a while, charged with disorderly conduct, or perhaps she’ll be taken to hospital. But increasingly a lack of mental health beds means she is then taken to prison “as a place of safety” and there she’ll stay, unsentenced and without specialist care, sometimes lingering in a cell for more than a year. These patients include (wrote Charlie Taylor, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, in a report last year) people whose psychosis can make them violent, meaning they’re held in isolation, and people so driven to harming themselves, “They have repeatedly blocked their own airways with bedding, removed teeth or maimed themselves to the point of exposing their own intestines.” In 19th-century asylums, women were offered very little mental health provision and patients routinely self-harmed. There are a series of unnerving and moving photos online by society photographer Henry Hering who took portraits of Bethlem patients, including Eliza Josolyne, admitted in 1857 with “overwork”. She “frequently tried to injure herself by knocking her head against doors and walls, and has slept in the padded room on this account”. Perhaps it’s unhelpful to keep returning to the Victorian asylums, but here is where my mind goes, aided in part by pictures of a prison currently housing women as “a place of safety” (the words catch on the tongue) – HMP Styal in Cheshire, which occupies a former “orphanage for destitute children” opened in 1898. There were 11 suicides at HMP Styal between 2007 and 2024, more than any other women’s jail in England. One was 18-year-old Annelise Sanderson, who had been arrested in 2020 for stealing a pair of trainers and assaulting emergency workers who had intervened. When she was apprehended she poured petrol on herself and tried to drink it; instead of being offered psychiatric treatment, she was sentenced to 12 months at Styal. A woman detained there at the same time told the BBC that it was “no place for a vulnerable young woman” and that Anderson “needed help, yet found herself in the same pit of monsters as me”. Other prisons house more tragedies. Last year a jury concluded that Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire failed to provide for 36-year-old Kay Melhuish’s “basic human needs” and that neglect (including a 10-day wait for clean underwear) contributed to her death by suicide. Melhuish was being held on remand during an acute mental health crisis – campaigning for access to her children, she was arrested holding a knife to her own throat. The prison was aware of her history of suicide attempts and self-harm, and had been warned that her autism and PTSD made prison (with its noise and regular use of force) particularly difficult for her to cope with. Less than three weeks after she arrived, she was dead. Her daughter told the Guardian, “Mum was ill, not bad.” Prison is not a place of safety. For women especially, it is a place of chaos and trauma where vulnerable people struggle to maintain their dignity, let alone sanity. A new report found that “the frustrations of day-to-day life” and a “lack of basic care” (including not being allowed to clean their underwear in washing machines) were driving women in prison to hurt themselves – the self-harm rate is 5,785 incidents per 1,000 prisoners, more than eight times higher than in men’s prisons. And into these containers of suffering are dropped women whose only crime is mental illness, who are not only locked inside bodies that are attacking them, but inside cells that inspire violence. Their presence imports further vulnerability to the prisons, to both prisoners and to staff, unequipped to deal with either complex mental health problems or the violence they might provoke. The women’s justice board’s plans to reduce the number of women in prison cannot come soon enough and should be only the beginning – prison is not a place of safety, it’s a place often, of dark and utter terror.

        "text": "BPD is one of the mental illnesses we still know least about, but now there is hope of a treatment It was while she was doing psychology A-level that Alison Graham came across Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) for the first time. “Two of my friends said: ‘Not to be mean, but this does sound like you …’,” Graham remembers. The teenager from Peterborough had suffered a particularly volatile adolescence: mood swings, rage, suicidal thoughts. She’d been cutting herself since she was 12 or 13. And now here was her condition – in a textbook. “I felt like I didn’t have a chance, that I was the perfect storm for this illness.” Problems had started early. Graham says she was the child of an unhappy marriage, with a father who drank and a mother who suffered from depression. She was 12 when her father left, 13 when the divorce came through. She started self-harming, flying into temper tantrums, blowing up friendships on the slightest pretext. Doctors said it was exam stress. She did very well in her GSCEs, but became more unstable in sixth form, and flunked her A-levels. Her first suicide attempt came at 18. “I got quite a lot of money for my 18th birthday and basically I drank it,” she says. On New Year’s Eve in 2018 she ended up in A&E. “I said I was going to jump off a building, so someone called an ambulance.” And then, after several years of trying to live with her condition, and trying to find out what that condition was, a doctor confirmed her suspicions. “She turned to me and said ‘have you ever heard of BPD?’” She was sent for an assessment and diagnosed in March last year. Attitudes towards many types of mental illnesses have been genuinely transformed in the developed world over the past generation, as people have opened up about their depression and anxiety, encouraged by the honesty of candid celebrities. But in the shadows are a cluster of conditions that continue to face deep discrimination: schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, and BPD. BPD in particular is one of the lesser-known mental illnesses, but all the same it is one of the hardest to reckon with. (Some people dislike the term so much they prefer to refer to emotionally unstable personality disorder.) Those affected can experience dizzying ups and downs, along with paranoia, impulsiveness, obsession, fury, catastrophic black-and-white thinking, identity crisis and an inability to self-soothe. Promiscuity, recklessness, self-sabotage, substance abuse, broken relationships and homelessness are all part of the territory. Some estimates put prevalence at up to 2% of the population, though most metrics relating to the extent of mental illnesses are approximate. An estimated one in 10 people with BPD take their own lives – and a far larger cohort will try to do so. Some doctors believe the number of people with the condition may be increasing. Dr Ajeng Puspitasari, a psychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, says she is treating more patients with BPD than she was two or three years ago. “Young adulthood is typically where symptoms may emerge,” she says. “There are very common symptoms, chronic suicide ideation or attempts. A lot of patients struggle with self-injury, burning, cutting. Many struggle with addiction, substance abuse, frantic efforts to cope with their suffering.” Experts believe the illness stems partly from genetic predisposition (nature) and partly from social and environmental factors (nurture), with a brutal childhood as a particularly common denominator. Katie Walsh believes that for her everything stemmed from being sexually abused by a family member as a child. She reported the abuse but wasn’t taken seriously until three years later when the perpetrator did the same to other children. Her later relationships with men, who were often much older, featured physical and emotional abuse; Walsh ended up in prison, self-harming, and struggling just to stay alive. Mick Finnegan, a 37-year-old Dubliner diagnosed with BPD, also believes the condition was rooted in his childhood. “I was just a kid whose family were all alcoholics and heroin addicts. I was 16 when I started sleeping rough. I got kicked out of the house. I had gone to the police about being raped and sexually abused. But when the police came back, they turned around and said they weren’t going to prosecute.” A recent study by the University of Manchester found that people with BPD were 13 times more likely to report childhood abuse than people without mental illness. “The more severe cases come from people who’ve suffered from childhood disorders – physical abuse, sexual abuse or abandonment,” says Jerold Kreisman, an American psychiatrist who has worked with BPD patients for 30 years and authored books such as “I Hate You Don’t Leave Me.” But where other mental health conditions are recognised and supported, the very nature of BPD means it can be challenging to help with. It’s hard for friends and family, who can struggle to deal with the rapid ups and downs and mood changes, the fluctuations in confidence and self-image. “I’ve hurt a lot of people and I feel terrible about it. I don’t want to be this way,” says Graham. “I have to keep a secret, because people say don’t be friends with someone with BPD because they are manipulative attention-seekers. They might not want to be my friend or date me, which hurts because I’m trying to get better. It’s not my fault.” The condition is also incredibly challenging for medical services, police and emergency services, resulting in confrontation and mutual distrust. Graham was sectioned recently for trespassing on train tracks. “I’m 5ft tall, but it took three police officers to restrain me,” she says. “I feel I get treated as if I’m an attention-seeker and they don’t seem to take it seriously.” But there is a treatment that, though not widely available, is showing signs of promise. Dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) is a long term programme of individual and group therapies in which the core ideas are acceptance of life as it is, not as it is supposed to be. Individuals learn new techniques to help tolerate distress, to replace catastrophic coping mechanisms such as self-harm, alcohol, drugs and rage. The “dialectic” in the name has echoes of the antithetical ideas proposed in ancient wisdoms and more modern faith-based teachings, such as the Christian Serenity Prayer, “to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can …” At St Andrew’s Healthcare in Northampton – one of some 450 facilities offering DBT in the UK – women patients take part in group therapy, one-to-one sessions, and coaching. There is a weekly community meeting where patients and staff can raise issues, as well as sessions on mindfulness and other activities. Patients often take medication alongside the therapy, but medication alone can never be the answer, says Dr Pete McAllister, a psychiatrist on the ward, who says that most women who engage in at least a year of DBT can be discharged. The average length of stay is 18 months. “The treatment works really well but it’s a bit like joining the gym,” says McAllister. “It’s not just joining that will help you, it’s doing the exercises and doing them regularly. Coming into a DBT unit is not the cure, it’s the hard work you do while you’re here.” The great succour for anyone with BPD is that recovery is the rule, not the exception. After intensive rounds of DBT, Walsh hasn’t self-harmed in two years. Now in her mid 30s, she is calm, collected and able to speak eloquently about her mental health struggles. Walsh talks about how she sees life in 10 years’ time. Her aim is to travel around the country speaking about BPD, sharing her story and holding workshops to raise awareness and to reach out to others who may be going through the same. “A lot of this goes on outside of services,” she says. “It can be lonely and I want people to not feel so alone.” Finnegan says that recovery might not be the right word. “You don’t just stop feeling the way you feel. You don’t stop having those flashbacks. They don’t go away but you learn how to cope with them. You develop coping mechanisms.” Graham has been holding down a job as a sales assistant for the past few months and is looking forward to getting a place on a DBT programme, now that she has been diagnosed. She sounds remarkably philosophical and sanguine about her case, and her prospects. But then that is the maddening thing about BPD. “One moment I am crying my eyes out, the next I’m feeling fine.” All the female subjects quoted in this article requested anonymity. Mick Finnegan, who has worked as a peer support worker in the NHS and is involved with the Royal College of Psychiatrists, was happy to be named in full and share his story in the hope it will help others. This article was amended on 26 August 2020. An earlier version wrongly said that St Andrew’s is one of the only places in the country offering dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT). It is a place where patients can receive DBT, however there are more than 450 other DBT programmes in the UK.",

        "title": "Cats, camels and a Jesus lizard: the rise of animal-assisted therapy | Mental health | The Guardian",
        "text": "Once considered eccentric, using animals in psychotherapy is becoming popular as research reveals benefits It’s the cat lovers’ dilemma. You buy sachets of food that stink out the house, clean out litter trays, and spend hundreds on vet bills. In return, the feline companion scratches your furniture and arms, deposits dead rodents on the carpet, and occasionally disappears for three days. “With humans, it’s survivor thinking: if I’m nice to people, they will be nice to me,” says Yoni Yehuda, an Israeli psychotherapist, as his cat Jack Daniels licks water from a jug on his office table. With animals, he says, there is no apparent quid pro quo. We help them for purer reasons, often with no expectation of a return. “It’s giving from something that is very clean inside.” This concept is the foundation of the professor’s work – providing therapy for people with mental health conditions by asking them to care for animals. There is healing, he believes, deeply rooted in the animal-human relationship. “The first animal-assisted psychotherapist was God,” he says, as a parrot pecks at the mosquito netting on his office window. Outside, a llama and a camel laze on the sand under the sun. Yehuda has hundreds of animals, from horses and turtles to an exotic Jesus lizard that runs on water and a ring-tailed South American coati. Most were rescued and for various reasons cannot be returned to the wild or re-homed. The centre and Yehuda’s work is at the experimental – even controversial – end of a scientific field that has become increasingly established and popular worldwide. Animals were used in mental health institutions in the late 18th century to encourage socialisation. Today, a patient might be given time to stroke a dog, which has been shown to reduce stress. Practitioners say animals can also motivate patients to stay in treatment, or be used as a metaphor for their own struggles. Some traumatised people prefer not to interact with another person at all. In the past few years, analyses of dozens of studies indicate animals in therapy can have a limited but positive impact on a range of disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. “A lot of the studies are not very high quality, but it gives a good view,” says Karin Hediger, a psychotherapist and researcher at the University of Basel, in Switzerland. For two years, Hediger has run a centre housing horses, rabbits and chickens, working with children and adults with psychological issues. She has found animals can break barriers with patients who struggle to understand how they feel, or even how they act. If her patients display aggression or frustration, a specifically trained therapy horse can read their body language and respond, often by backing away. “The client realises there is something going on,” Hediger says. Some patients do not speak. In that case, she says, “it’s perfect to work with animals, because they are non-verbal, too”. As the field grows, an umbrella group, the International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organizations (IAHAIO), has sought to promote more and higher-quality research. “There are effects, and they are scientifically proven. But many of the effects are very difficult to prove statistically because they are on an emotional level,” says the president, Prof Marie-José Enders-Slegers. “On the emotional level, you see [patients] are relaxed, they have fun, and they are peaceful and they have joy. And that is such a fantastic thing.” IAHAIO has worked to professionalise the field, implementing professional and ethical guidelines. It banned therapy with exotic species, such as monkeys and reptiles, not only because of potential dangers but risks of transferable disease. Captive dolphin therapy, in particular, has been condemned by many in the community as inhumane pseudoscience, with little quality research backing it up. Yehuda is something of a maverick. At his therapeutic centre in a settlement in the occupied West Bank, he has developed his own methods, working with both domesticated and wild animals. He began his career by using himself as a patient. In 1987, while a paratrooper, his right side was paralysed, and he was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. When he was wounded again after being shot by a Palestinian militant, his mental condition deteriorated. “I started practising on myself, and trying to understand my feelings, my being,” he recalls. Yehuda now has a PhD in psychology and runs a well-respected three-year course at Hebrew University. He has several self-designed methods, normally using particular animals for different conditions. With phobias, he has a programme with stick insects, butterflies, and worms. “If we have problems with eating problems, like anorexia and bulimia, we have a special method to work with iguanas.” His centre has remained open throughout the pandemic in a limited capacity. One of his patients, who asks to remain anonymous, says he “started to stop functioning” after fighting for the Israeli army in Gaza during the 2014 war. Sleeping all day and awake all night, he “was on the verge of being hospitalised”. When he booked into the centre, he expected to be asked questions about his feelings. Instead, Yehuda told him to look after the goats. “I had no interest in animals. I sat for hours with the goats,” he remembers as he walks around the enclosure. “It wore me down physically, helped me to sleep,” he adds. After several weeks, he approached Yehuda as he felt ready to talk, and months later still helps at the centre. Yehuda says animal-assisted therapy is a “new, living and kicking” field of psychotherapy but that his work is very ancient, even instinctual. His aim is to make people feel they have a goal in their lives, “even if it is just giving water to a cat”.",

        "text": "I support women who sell sex on the streets. Coronavirus has made life harder and has had terrible consequences I’m looking at the list of names on the office wall of all the women I support, who are all involved in selling sex on the streets. It’s our weekly team meeting and I brief my colleagues on how the Friday night outreach team met Marcia, a homeless woman in a violent relationship. She is sleeping with her abusive boyfriend because it’s safer than sleeping rough on her own. He forces her to share needles, and to sell sex. We talk about ways to support her, but without a phone or address it’s difficult. It’s hard to find places I can meet with women like Marcia – many cafes, where we build trust and rapport, are closed. I add her name to the list, and fire off emails to the police and street homeless teams. I open my laptop and find urgent emails from both probation and police regarding Sally, a woman I’ve been supporting. A while back I received similar emails to inform me that one of my clients had killed herself. My heart races as I open them. My worst fears are confirmed: Sally has died due to a suspected overdose. I feel numb. I call a colleague who met Sally on outreach many times. We process the news together. I don’t want to think about removing Sally’s name from my list. Luckily, today is my monthly clinical supervision. It’s a much-needed space to process the pain of supporting women through such challenging circumstances. Since lockdown this has too often included grief following death. It is not something I was prepared for. It’s 10am. I’ve been waiting for an hour. I keep calling Linda’s phone, but it goes to voicemail. I’m praying she turns up. At 10.15am she runs up apologising profusely. She couldn’t find anywhere to stay last night so couldn’t charge her phone. Amazingly she has all her important documents with her. How she has managed to keep them safe all these months while living in chaos astounds me. We hop on a bus, arriving late to the supported accommodation. The staff treat her with kindness. I leave her to settle into her new room, and visit some other women I support who live here. Pre-coronavirus, Thursdays were my favourite day of the week. A colleague and I would take an early morning seat in a cafe near to where the women would sell sex. We’d wait for women to see us for a chat, hot drink, food. However, the cafe is shut and unlikely to open for months. I sit at my desk feeling a pang of sadness. It was always a great place to connect with women who did not have phones. Sally, who died, was often one of them. I keep thinking that if it wasn’t for the pandemic, things could have been different for her. We would have not lost connection. I could have helped her with her substance abuse issues. I call women on the phone trying to support them as best I can. It’s not the same but it’s better than nothing. I’m doing outreach tonight. At 10pm, a volunteer and I take condoms, clean needles, hot chocolate and food on to the beat. We meet Jenny, and I remind her to contact her probation officer for an appointment next week. She’s grateful for the hat and gloves I give her, as it’s getting chilly. I spot Natalie, who I haven’t seen since before Covid. We can’t hug now which feels sad. Often that would be the only non-exploitative contact she’d have all night. We leave her on the corner. When I look back, I see her tumble into a punter’s car. We wonder – not for the first time – who would buy sex from such vulnerable women.

        "text": "I work to support disabled people to find employment. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a massive increase in people seeking help I check the referrals to the service over the weekend. We support disabled people across England and Wales to find employment, and in the past three months we’ve seen a 200% year-on-year increase in registration for our services. I catch up with one of our employment advisers. They have been speaking to a new customer, Julie, who was recently made redundant from her role as a PA for 11 years. She is the only one in her team of four to be made redundant, and the only one who is disabled. Sadly, this is a common theme since the furlough scheme approached its original end. We’ve worked on her CV, and a plan to find similar roles. She is upset and daunted at the prospect of finding a job during a pandemic. I meet with an employer who is keen to recruit more disabled people. Employers often have their own preconceived ideas about what a disabled person can and can’t do. We talk about how often minor changes make a big difference for disabled people, and a government support scheme that funds them called Access to Work. We discuss hosting a virtual careers day. We work to find roles with employers who actively want to hire more disabled people. This can encourage our customers who are often conflicted about when to disclose their disability to employers due to fear of bias – conscious or otherwise – and discrimination. I spend the afternoon working with my team leaders as our advisers are completely overwhelmed by calls. We discuss ways of increasing capacity. The team is very resilient but hearing horror employment stories daily, especially from people in the retail and hospitality, is tough. In the current competitive job market, disabled people sadly often end up at the back of the queue. A customer has a chaotic home life and is unable to speak to us as other family members are at home due to Covid restrictions. They don’t want her to find work. I consult with our internal safeguarding team and refer them to local social services. In the afternoon we receive some great feedback from a customer who has been in work for three months. It has had a positive effect on her mental health, so much so that she is looking to take on extra hours. I speak to Neel, who is looking for a job after a couple of years volunteering at a local charity shop. He has a learning disability and has found it challenging applying for jobs – most of his previous roles came through his local job centre, open only sporadically during the pandemic. A lot of the work we do focuses on building people’s confidence. We encourage them and affirm that their expertise, work ethic and contribution to an organisation deserves to be valued and respected. It’s our team meeting. We share positive stories from customers, including Steve, who has just found a role as a HR administrator after being out of work for over two years. Steve had interview support from the service and is so happy to be starting work. There’s also Anna. She recently started a role in a coronavirus testing centre, and she’s truly happy and relieved after losing her job in a factory where she had worked for 30 years. With the right adjustments and support from her employer, I know she’ll thrive in this role.

        "text": "Working as a GP in a deprived part of the UK has its challenges, particularly during this pandemic My first patient is a woman who works in healthcare. She has booked a face to face GP consultation. I see her in the waiting room: she’s breathless and coughing uncontrollably. With my mask, visor and apron on, I ask her to come through to my room. Experience tells me she has Covid-19.\n I measure her vital signs. Her oxygen saturations are 94% on room air, which is low; I listen to her chest, which sounds fine. I tell her to go home and self-isolate, as per government guidelines, and prescribe some antibiotics. I start my day with a parent whose child has a persistent fever and a sore throat. The mother refuses to consider that the child may have coronavirus. This is not the first time a patient or their parent/guardian has been dismissive of the existence of the virus and the fact that it can affect each and every one of us. I work in one of the most deprived parts of the UK, where we are faced with a lot of health inequalities. They stem from a number of factors including language barriers, cultural behaviours, socioeconomic factors and unconscious bias. I explain to the mother she must self-isolate with her child and others in their household until a Covid-19 test kit is sent to them. She is quite reluctant at first, but I manage to convince her to follow the national guidelines. The coronavirus pandemic has impacted everyone in some way. I carry out a telephone consultation with a nurse who has been working on a Covid ward. She is not enjoying the environment at all. She is struggling to work with her colleagues, who she describes as being stressed and on edge. It has taken a toll on her mental health: she is unable to sleep and has panic attacks every time she enters the hospital. I give her a sicknote so she can take some time off to recharge, but also find another job. I speak to a patient in her 80s who is having issues with her right knee. She is finding life a struggle, especially with lockdown, and has felt lonely due to the pandemic. This has been a recurring theme for most of my elderly patients this year. I ask her to come in to see me for a face to face consultation so I can assess her knee. I also make sure to address her feelings of isolation by referring her to some community groups. A lot of patients are still apprehensive about going to A&E due to the fear of catching Covid-19. I see one patient who has classic symptoms of kidney stones. She has a fever, and is experiencing excruciating pain which is radiating from the back to the groin. The patient wants to try to avoid A&E so I organise some imaging to be done in an outpatient clinic. I make sure she knows to attend the emergency department if the fever persists and the pain worsens.\n It’s the end of a stressful week, dealing with many patients’ emotions and stresses brought on by this pandemic. Most have said to me: “Can 2020 be wiped clean from the calendar, and can we start this year again in January?”",

        "text": "I work with mothers who have had their children removed, often because of domestic violence and mental health issues I lead a team of practitioners working with mothers who have had their children taken into care. We meet virtually for morning check-in so we can identify risks and issues, and agree what to do. We receive a call telling us that Rachel is being held in custody for antisocial behaviour and is waiting to be seen in virtual court. It isn’t her first arrest, so she could be given a custodial sentence. She is a survivor of domestic abuse, which led to the removal of her children. Her practitioner contacts the custody sergeant. We know the devastating and lasting impact of short sentences for women: custody could mean the loss of her home and a halt on benefits, as well as a disruption to her community mental health support. Critically, it would also mean her contact with her children would stop. Later that evening, Rachel is back home on bail. We call; she is safe, being seen by the mental health team and can attend contact with her children next week. A hopeful start to the week. Faith calls today, to tell us she can’t afford food. We refer her to her local food bank. She feels lost and talks to us about the profound loss of identity she has felt since the removal of her children last year, due to risks around domestic violence and mental health. So much of what she knows and understands about herself is as a mother. She still lives in what was her family home and is struggling with her identity and purpose. Today I speak to Sarah, who has a history of mental health issues including anxiety, depression and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Before lockdown, her mental health was improving, but the sense of isolation and not being able to have the same level of contact with her son has taken its toll. We talk about what music makes her smile, write positive affirmations and identify people in her life who she can talk to, as well as helping her with activities to do over Skype with her son. Fiona’s child was adopted a year ago, and today is his birthday. Not being able to see her son today is very distressing for Fiona and leads to feelings of guilt, anxiety and sadness. We try to mitigate the pain of the empty space and build resilience to help her manage the many more birthdays still to come. We drop off cake, candles and flowers on her doorstep and call to tell her to look outside. We sing Happy Birthday, and she blows out the candles, making a wish for her son. Fridays are tough for the people we help as they face a weekend with limited services. My morning is spent looking at the impact Pause has had on areas such as mental health, domestic abuse and engagement with other services. It looks like we’re making a positive difference. I finish the day by contacting a new referral. Usually I’d knock on her door. Today our introduction is by phone. There are recent domestic abuse and mental health issues that contributed to the removal of her children. We talk for more than an hour. The loss of her children has left her in a state of fear about their future. She feels she is ready for support and ready to make changes. She talks about ending her relationship and what that would mean for her, listing all the positives she wants to get out of her life and what she needs to get there. She sounds like she’s ready to trust us and work together. Names have been changed. Charlie Oswald is a practice lead for Pause",

        "title": "Five years on from the pandemic, how has Covid changed our world? | Stephen Reicher, Rachel Clarke, Rafael Behr,  Frances Ryan and others | The Guardian",
        "text": "We asked a group of experts on politics, trade, literature, psychology, work and more: what has been the most surprising or shocking consequence of Covid-19 in your field? Stephen Reicher Professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy Great calamities often provoke reflections about the human condition. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 led people to reconsider their relationship with God, and compelled Voltaire to viciously lampoon Leibniz’s notion that we live in the best of all possible worlds. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic forced people to rethink how they relate to the natural world, inspiring a new style of architecture, a new appreciation of the outdoors, and a range of back-to-nature movements. And Covid … ? Well, judging by the coverage of the inquiry so far, the big issues seem to be how government figures used WhatsApp and who uttered which obscenity about whom. But despite this masterclass in trivialisation, Covid did have something profound to teach us about the relationship of individuals to society. For nearly two centuries, since the spectacular growth of cities sparked by the advent of industrialisation, western social thought has been obsessed with how to maintain control.Once people were concentrated together and physically separated from their erstwhile masters, would they still respect the old hierarchies? Or would they join together to dismantle them? This was reflected in a profound fear of the masses, particularly of crowds. The social elites lived in perpetual fear of the howling mobs. The outcome was a pervasive pessimism about the popular psyche and an entrenched anti-collectivism. This still dominates my discipline, psychology. It is reflected in the notion that human reasoning, at best, is inherently flawed, and that the flaws are accentuated when we act in groups. Such views are popular in government, and they shaped the initial response to Covid – with disastrous consequences. Remember “behavioural fatigue” – the notion that people would lack the psychological resilience to cope with stringent measures? This contributed to the delay of the first lockdown. Yet concerns that the masses wouldn’t measure up were ill-founded. The common threat of Covid led people to develop a shared identity based around community. People became more concerned about the fate of others, which was reflected in enduring levels of adherence to stringent restrictions – even though, by following the lockdown rules, many suffered considerable hardships. Resilience, it turned out, was not something people lacked, but something that arises when people think and act as a group. For many, though, that realisation came too late. It has been estimated that, had Britain locked down a week earlier, it could have saved more than 30,000 people. Two weeks, and up to 40,000 more people would have survived. The cost of pessimistic individualism was ultimately measured in tens of thousands of lives. The Covid response of the UK government was shot through with the notion that we, the people, were very much part of the problem. Disdain was the defining feature of the Johnson government’s approach, visible in his refusal to be candid about the challenges we faced, in the policy of blame and punishment for those breaking the rules, and in the government’s refusal to engage with communities and provide them with the resources they needed to comply with the rules. It was perhaps best encapsulated by Matt Hancock’s explanation for why the government repeatedly refused calls to increase support for self-isolation: because people would game the system. The story of Covid is one of an opportunity missed through ideological myopia. Far from being a problem, the public were the best asset the government had in dealing with the pandemic. Rather than harnessing that asset, ministers ignored and undermined it. They did so precisely because of their fear of the masses. So, for me, the big issue to come out of Covid is the need to rethink the relationship between the individual and the collective. Far from eroding our rationality, the group empowers us, makes us agents of our own fate and provides resilience in hard times. If we don’t understand that, we will have learned nothing from Covid, and the next pandemic response will be as much of a shambles as the last. Sophie Mackintosh Author whose debut novel, The Water Cure, was longlisted for the 2018 Booker prize It’s been five years since the start of the Covid pandemic, and yet there have been few novels grappling explicitly with its impact. Earlier this year I was speaking to the Norwegian author Helga Flatland about her novel Toxic, at the Kerala literature festival. It struck me that hers was one of the few books I’ve read that firmly locates itself in that specific era. The events are set in motion by the first lockdowns: the protagonist moves from Oslo to the countryside, and the novel is punctuated with Zoom calls, bubbles and online classes. In Toxic the pandemic is present, rather than viewed from a distance. But then, where are the big novels reflecting on what the experience has taught us, shown us? Has it even taught us anything, seeing as it seems our position, as a society, is mostly one of denial? Talking about “pandemic literature” as a concept also makes it seem as if it’s over, when the lives of many people continue to be irrevocably altered by Covid. There’s a clear beginning, but no definitive ending. Five years, in this context, seems like no time at all. I spoke to my editor, Hermione Thompson, editorial director at Hamish Hamilton, who agreed that it just still might be too soon. “We start trying to make sense of an event from the moment it kicks off, and art which comes out of that white heat of experience can be incredibly powerful,” she said. “But you have to wait a bit longer – often a lot longer – for the wider picture to come into focus. And once you can see it, perhaps you have to wait a while more before you can bear to actually look at it.” Her submission pile is full of escapist stories. Readers, she told me, perhaps want “to be taken as far away as possible from the frightening prospect of reality”. Perhaps it makes sense to think of Covid’s impact on fiction as something more abstract. I’ve come to see my third novel, Cursed Bread, as a pandemic novel of sorts, though it’s set in 1950s France, against the background of a mass poisoning. This appealed at the time, allowing me to escape as I wrote it in a frantic burst of energy between January 2020 and January 2021. But you can’t shut out the world entirely, and it was only afterwards that I saw obvious influences: a novel about desire in which the protagonist is hardly touched, the impact of collective trauma, a feverish claustrophobia. Thompson singled out Ali Smith’s Companion Piece, and last year’s Booker prize winner, Orbital, as standout novels inspired by the experience of lockdown. But my favourite Covid novel is Burntcoat by Sarah Hall – released in October 2021, a mere 18 months after that first lockdown. Eerily prescient in its portrayal of a virus that lingers in the body, it’s also expansive, asking questions about art, love and creation in the face of disaster. Written in that aforementioned “white heat”, it didn’t wait for the event to feel distant, but captured that strange time as it happened – and perhaps in that state of rawness yielded something that felt more true and significant. Rafael Behr Guardian columnist and leader writer What politicians do is generally more important than where they do it. But the pandemic brought an unusual focus on the spaces where power is wielded – the rooms where stuff happened; how many people were there; whether what they were doing counted as work under lockdown regulations. Those questions, and Boris Johnson’s inability to give straight answers, ended up being more consequential for politics than the deadly effects of the virus itself. It was not the cost of bad decisions made in No 10 that brought down the prime minister, but the after-hours parties in the same building. Both failings were twin expressions of Johnson’s disorderly character. A leader with an ethical compass who exuded professional discipline by day would not have generated a workplace culture that licensed rowdy piss-ups by night. Partygate was explosive because it made a mockery of millions of sacrifices by law-abiding citizens who had answered the call of duty to suspend their own needs, to forgo weddings, birthdays, funerals, in a communal struggle against the virus. It was the perfect scandal to mobilise resentment of a remote and arrogant political class that doesn’t feel bound by rules it imposes on everyone else. This was hardly a new sentiment. But it was intensified by feelings of betrayal after the initial phase of the pandemic, which had been marked by a spirit of national solidarity. The prime minister benefited from that mood. His poll ratings were not dented by fatal early policy vacillations. His popularity peaked around the time that he was personally incapacitated by Covid. Johnson’s landslide victory in the 2019 general election, on a pledge to “get Brexit done”, conveyed a strong public appetite for calmer, less ferociously partisan politics. The first lockdown effectively delivered just that. The enabling law – monumentally draconian for a democracy – was bundled through parliament in four days. The famously raucous Commons chamber was muted by social distancing strictures. Chronic dysfunction at the centre, wasteful misallocation of resources, lethal hesitation and divisions over strategy – these didn’t go unreported. There were intimations of the coming unravelling, not least in the furore around Dominic Cummings’s notorious excursion to Barnard Castle. Politics was not suspended. But it was muted for months. With Partygate, the staggering degeneracy of Johnson’s regime was vomited before the public gaze. The scale of administrative dysfunction and the deficit of accountability were functions of a political culture that resists modernisation, venerates dilettantism and conflates rhetorical dexterity with judgment. When Britain needed serious, sober leadership, it found itself at the mercy of inadequate, clownish whimsy. That was a tragedy but not an accident; a feature of the system, not a bug. The debauching of Downing Street during lockdown was unlawful and the prime minister’s dishonest denials put him in contempt of parliament. Those were the technical offences that finished his career. But the true penalty is still being paid by everyone else. It is measured in heightened cynicism and depleted trust in governing institutions that need to command public confidence for democracy to function. Laleh Khalili Professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian Peninsula Suzhou, a city in eastern China, is where the world’s technology is made. Its factories produce products for companies such as Foxconn and Samsung, and are staffed by millions of labourers, mostly migrant workers from rural China. In late January 2020, Suzhou’s municipal government, following Beijing’s orders, took the unprecedented step of extending the lunar new year holidays and delaying the return of migrant workers. Transport in and out of China slowed to a crawl. Factory towns, including Suzhou, closed. While media coverage of lockdowns focused on their human impact, the pandemic transformed supply chains, and had a huge impact on global trade. At sea, ships were in effect stranded; with ports closed, there was nowhere to dock their cargo. International maritime treaties dictate that seafarers shouldn’t spend more than 11 continuous months at sea. According to the International Maritime Organization, the number of sailors working long after the end of their contracts rose to 400,000. Some remained on their ships for more than 22 months, wandering the world’s seas with no end in sight. On land, last-mile logistics drivers delivering food and groceries were designated as frontline workers. In Britain, along with nurses and bus drivers, they were among the largest group of workers who became ill with Covid. Not everyone suffered from the effects of the virus. Shipping companies sought subsidies from governments, even as increased demand for goods meant their rates rose to their highest in history, netting them eye-watering profits. Because Chinese trade slowed, so too did the production, sale and export of personal protective equipment (PPE) beyond the Chinese border. Spying an opportunity, charlatans with excellent connections to the British government set up companies to provide PPE, and cleaned up on lucrative contracts for often defective or even nonexistent products. The week-long closure of the Suez canal in March 2021 by a ship run aground had little to do with Covid-19, but only confirmed the fragility of the ostensibly efficient and frictionless global logistical routes that defined our world. This realisation compelled some European and US corporations to shift their factories nearer to home, to the peripheries of Europe or the Mexican borderlands. The US had already been threatening a trade war with China long before the slowdown, and “nearshoring” neatly fitted with this new strategic posture. During his first term as president, Donald Trump blamed the pandemic on alleged biological warfare by the Chinese government. In his second term, some of the stories he spun back then can be marshalled for a new purpose. Capitalism’s common features – the offshoring of industry, the outsourcing of labour and the skyrocketing costs of shipping – can now be blamed on a nefarious Chinese agenda. As Trump effects a flurry of executive orders implementing tariffs against China and many other trading partners, we’re seeing the new era of trade that Covid helped to accelerate. Frances Ryan Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People My earliest memory is the tins of peas. A couple of weeks into the first Covid lockdown, I was getting used to being stuck at home 24/7. Like millions of other clinically vulnerable people, the shielding programme meant I wasn’t even supposed to go to the shops for fruit and veg (or gin). In the back of the cupboard, I was relieved to find some vitamins and, with them, a shred of hope. It was a hard time for many, of course, but a few things made it easier. With theatres and the pub closed, entertainment was beamed remotely to our front rooms – access many disabled people had long dreamed of. At the same time, the public were taking Covid protections – from masks to testing – that helped keep those of us at high risk as safe as we could be. Five years on, I would like to say such progress continued but I think we all know that would be a lie. Remote access to social and cultural events has largely been revoked now non-disabled people no longer need it. While WFH has been normalised, it’s repeatedly dismissed as an excuse to skive. Since the last legal Covid protections were removed in 2022, clinically vulnerable people have been left with the “choice” of in effect shielding indefinitely or risking our lives each time we go out. Many disabled readers have told me they no longer feel able to do simple things like have a pint with a friend. Others with long Covid have lost jobs and relationships. The “return to normal” did not include everyone. It isn’t simply that the things that helped clinically vulnerable people to stay safe have gone – there’s pushback to the idea that we even deserve them. Simply wearing a mask ourselves in 2025 – let alone asking someone else to – is enough to get yelled at by a stranger in Tesco. It feels at times as if the pandemic unmasked (no pun intended) a blend of denial and resentment towards disabled people, as if our needs are simultaneously a reminder of a time society would rather forget, and evidence of a sense of entitlement from an uppity minority. As one district nurse told me last year when I asked if she would mind testing for Covid before she came to my home if I gave her a lateral flow test: “It isn’t for people like you to tell us what to do.” Whether it’s anger over the benefits bill or a bus having a priority wheelchair space, there’s a longstanding prejudice that disabled people are costly and demanding when all we are asking is to be able to live. In that way, the pandemic didn’t change negative attitudes towards disability – it just exacerbated them. It’s natural to want to gain from a bad situation, as if all the pain wasn’t for nothing. Perhaps, though, real progress comes in being honest: in saying we tried for equality and solidarity but fell short. It is only in admitting our shortcomings as a country that we will ever do better for disabled people – to figuratively dig in the back of the cupboard together and find the peas. William Davies Sociologist and political economist. His latest book is Unprecedented? How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy From time to time, a student contacts me having found a relic from the 2020-2021 academic year. Not some social distancing tool, although campuses still have plastic screens that haven’t yet been disposed of, or the bits of gaffer tape on carpet that students were instructed not to cross. No, these students have come across some actual treasure: a lecture video, still stored in the cloud, but no longer accessible. The question is: since they can’t attend a lecture, can I release the video instead? There are usually practical reasons why not. Lectures change from year to year. But the bigger question this poses is what is the case for in-person attendance in the first place? Universities made it through the pandemic thanks to digital platforms and “edtech”. The difficulty is how to put the genie back in the bottle, and resuscitate what made a campus a valuable space of congregation in the first place. As in schools, falling student attendance levels are one of the many scars left by Covid-19. Putting the other mental-health legacies of lockdowns to one side for a moment, they also triggered a social crisis: for a period of time, it became possible, necessary and – to some extent – convenient to live your life from your bedroom. With that option established, busy corridors, lecture halls and conversational seminars may seem confusing and sometimes even threatening. What’s more, there is no question that for a generation raised with YouTube and smartphones it makes perfect sense to “consume” a lecture at the time, place and even speed of one’s choosing. Note-taking can become verbatim with the availability of closed captioning. How does a university or individual lecturer stand in the way of this without merely seeming conservative or obstructive? There are plenty of valid benefits of a thriving campus and classroom, such as forging identities, making friends or participating in sports and political campaigns. Universities are now at pains to emphasise these, seeking to make their campuses more “sticky” via the introduction of additional cafes, social spaces and gyms. But at some point, the pedagogical question needs to be confronted: why can’t we just release a load of content? Profit-hungry edtech providers and the consultants hoovering up fees in the current maelstrom of cost-cutting won’t want the question to die. The answer ultimately lies in cultivating in students a tolerance for ambiguity – the ambiguity of social space, the ambiguity of exactly what a lecturer (or text) meant, and the ambiguity of what counts as a “good” argument or essay. At risk of romanticising the experience of in-person teaching and learning, it offers at its best a kind of collective holding environment in which it is OK to be uncertain or ignorant about things, safe in the knowledge that this uncertainty and ignorance will gradually recede. A teaching space contains all sorts of relationships, both tacit and formal, that ensure learning is never a simple transaction or transmission of information. In such communities, not everything is divided into “correct” and “incorrect” answers. For a period of time, Covid inserted a digital interface into billions of social relations, turning educational exchange into a type of game, in which there are “moves”, “scores” and “results”, but no productive ambiguity. This was a disaster for the young people who became trapped in bedrooms, with their education reduced to mechanical inputs and outputs. The struggle to reverse this continues. Devi Sridhar Chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author of How Not to Die (Too Soon) I recently had to teach master’s students about the pandemic and could feel my heart rate quicken at the prospect. “Collective amnesia” is the best way to describe how the world has since decided to approach Covid. We’d rather forget the initial fears about the disease, the trauma of hearing the daily death toll, the rainbow signs in windows and the lockdowns. If you survived, it’s easy to look back and think it wasn’t that bad. Those who died aren’t around to contribute their views, although their loved ones have made powerful interventions. A colleague who lost his 34-year-old son in 2021 reminded me that these voices aren’t heard enough. More than 230,000 people in the UK have lost their lives to the disease. This is how I narrate what occurred during the pandemic. In 2020, governments that had a consistent message and coherent plan – such as Sweden and South Korea – used public health measures such as mass testing, masks and awareness campaigns, and didn’t have to resort to severe interventions, or even lockdowns. In the summer of 2020, trial data indicated we would soon have vaccines. At this point, every country should have been trying to buy time before the vaccines could be rolled out, using tests to identify cases and stop chains of infection. Doing this without causing significant disruption to education, society and the economy was a huge challenge. Some countries and regions managed to strike the right balance. Others did not. Once vaccines arrived in December 2020, the objective shifted. Instead of just containing the spread of Covid-19, health authorities began trying to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. Countries that pivoted quickly to this strategy, such as New Zealand and South Korea, managed to avoid major loss of life. Those that continued trying to contain the virus without promoting vaccines across their populations, such as China and Hong Kong, suffered a delayed wave of Covid cases and a high death toll. As a public health expert, a lingering question I now ask myself is whether something like this could happen again, within our lifetimes. Avian flu is spreading across the US and infecting birds and cows. Meanwhile, an unidentified illness found in bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already killed more than 50 people. Both of these examples show that outbreaks are inevitable and unpredictable. It would be over simplistic to claim that, as a society, we overreacted to Covid. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can prevent a similar pandemic from occurring again. Avian flu is currently one of the most concerning diseases. If it begins to spread among humans, and carries a high fatality rate, governments won’t need to ask people to stay home. Those people will look around at their loved ones, hear what’s happening to families and in hospitals, and make decisions about their safety for themselves. That’s why collective amnesia is the wrong response to Covid. No matter how much we might wish to forget it ever happened, we should now be focusing on building resilience for the next pandemic, and investing in science, particularly vaccine programmes. That would be a far better way to honour the legacy of those who died from this disease. Rachel Shabi Author of Not the Enemy – Israel’s Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About Antisemitism The stats alone show us the significance of Covid mutual aid groups. By April 2020, a month after Britain’s first national lockdown was announced, a network of about 4,000 mutual aid groups was up and running. One survey in May that year reported that 10 million people in the UK were involved in some form of volunteering in response to the pandemic. Analysis of the impact of these groups has appraised them as having been essential in keeping society’s most vulnerable afloat during the Covid crisis. Mutual aid plugged a giant hole left by a seemingly indifferent and incompetent government, whether by providing food deliveries, prescription-runs and dog-walks, or casting a mental safety net to the lonely and isolated, with regular check-ins across a (socially distanced) doorstep. Mutual aid, a term coined by the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, is a hyperlocal system of support premised on the slogan “solidarity not charity”. It is about horizontal, two-way support: the idea that we all gain from helping each other because humans are wired to collaborate and connect; to participate and to share. It is fundamentally a political idea, even if not always articulated that way by those involved. When I interviewed mutual aiders across the country, volunteers often described it as providing meaning and purpose in a way that regular paid work did not. While these groups were at their peak, there was talk of society being rebuilt from the bottom up, the process itself creating a new collective push for a different kind of party politics. It didn’t really turn out that way, even though mutual aid itself did not go away when the worst of the pandemic died down. A report in 2022 suggested that four in 10 of the mutual aid groups set up during the pandemic were still going, with many focused on helping communities cope with the cost of living crisis. Today, we still see versions of mutual aid everywhere, from disaster-relief groups dealing with the fires that raged across Los Angeles, to the networks providing food, medical relief and safe zones in response the humanitarian catastrophe of Sudan’s war. It springs up whenever a crisis meets an inadequate state response. In other words, mutual aid still thrives precisely because it is a way for people to connect and do something in response to multiple, spiralling global crises, even as they grow increasingly disengaged from party politics. It is both the failure of and alienation from big “P” politics that drives support for mutual aid, as governments do not meaningfully address the climate emergency or redress terrible social iniquities. It’s hard to see how the dots between community organising and political pressure might connect. But perhaps that is to miss the point of mutual aid. The shift is in the tissue of the relationships forged, the practice of accountability to each other. Amid a global surge in far-right politics premised on competitive individualism, mutual aid builds awareness that societies can instead be founded on collectivism – and those that do will thrive. Helen McCarthy Historian and author of Double Lives: A History of Working Motherhood Women’s working lives changed after March 2020 in complicated ways. Many found themselves on the frontline of the NHS. In other sectors historically dominated by women, such as retail and hospitality, workers were imperilled by restrictions, and millions were furloughed. Meanwhile, school and nursery closures meant that frazzled mothers now had to juggle Zoom calls with round-the-clock childcare. Five years on, how does the picture look for working women? As a historian, it is hard to resist comparisons with an earlier crisis, the second world war, which mobilised millions of women and helped kickstart the dramatic growth in their employment that swept the second half of the 20th century. Covid hasn’t done anything like that. On the eve of the virus, the female employment rate was high – 72% – and it has barely changed since. But that headline figure may mask the effects of the pandemic on older women, thousands of whom have moved out of the workforce into early retirement, or are now classed as “economically inactive”. This trend has also affected men, but women’s reasons for not being in work are more likely to include caring for family or long-term illness, including long Covid, of which there are more female sufferers than male. These numbers also conceal the pressures experienced by mothers who are barely hanging on to their jobs owing to the lack of affordable childcare. The UK’s problems with childcare did not start in 2020, but the chaos of lockdowns exacerbated staff shortages. Many workers left the sector for more stable and less stressful jobs, and costs have continued to spiral. At the start of the pandemic, there were hopes that the pivot to remote working would help working parents achieve a better balance by cutting out the commute and giving them more control over their time. Before 2020, only one in eight workers reported working from home. That figure has now risen to two in five. Here, there’s an echo of the second world war, when part-time shifts were promoted to sceptical employers as a means of recruiting housewives to munitions factories that desperately needed labour. By the 1980s, about a third of working-age women were employed part-time. Those jobs were typically low-skilled, low-paid and carried fewer rights than full-time jobs. Today’s hybrid workers, by contrast, are more likely to be well-paid professionals. They are also more likely to be men. Initially, there was a sense that fathers would embrace equal, hands-on parenting styles if they spent more time at home. If anything, workplace inequalities have persisted. True, some mothers in white-collar occupations have undoubtedly benefited from hybrid working. But much larger numbers of women remain in jobs that are less amenable to home-based work, including those in hospitals, care homes and supermarkets. It is cruelly ironic that one of the few positive legacies of the pandemic is mostly unavailable to those whose essential labour got Britain through the crisis. Samira Shackle Journalist and the author of Karachi Vice In July 2023, the US politician Robert Kennedy Jr was filmed saying that “Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and that the US “put hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes”. Now, in February 2025, Kennedy is US health secretary. It is a stark example of a much broader phenomenon: in the five years since the Covid pandemic began, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringes of society to the centres of power. During the pandemic, more people began to doubt authorities, expertise and elites. Populist movements, including some explicitly rooted in conspiracies, already existed before Covid – but the pandemic significantly broadened their appeal. QAnon began in 2017, as a response to (false) claims that Hillary Clinton was the leader of an elite cabal of paedophiles, but by 2020, its supporters were campaigning against masks and vaccines. This is indicative of the way in which conspiracy movements adapt and cross-pollinate; during the pandemic, we also saw longtime conspiracy grifters such as David Icke and Piers Corbyn taking on Covid as a cause, as that’s where a new audience lay. When I reported on the rise of Covid conspiracies in the miserable locked-down spring of 2021, it struck me that many of the people I spoke to had started with reasonable concerns. They were isolated, angry, and suffering financially and emotionally as a result of lockdowns. They had a sense that something wasn’t right, and the idea that the pandemic was being exaggerated, or was cover for something more sinister, provided an explanation. (As the writer Naomi Klein has said: “Conspiracy culture gets the facts wrong, but the feeling is right.”) I spoke to some people over the course of a few months, and as they became more immersed in the online world of conspiracies, their initial views became more extreme – perhaps a shift from questioning the origins of the pandemic to full-blown vaccine scepticism. “I’ve definitely fallen out with the government, and I will never, ever trust them again,” one woman told me. The pandemic vastly expanded the number of people who feel this way. As a general rule, once someone has engaged fully in one set of conspiracy theories, investing time and energy in them, and probably losing real-world friends in the process, they become more receptive to other conspiracies too. And those who peddle these theories online adapt their views according to what is most popular or expedient. People who came to prominence talking about the pandemic have since moved on to other issues, taking their audience with them. A number of British Telegram groups set up during the pandemic to oppose lockdowns and vaccinations have switched to far-right messaging, for instance. The pandemic and associated lockdowns may have receded from the public imagination, but people who really bought into the conspiracies swirling around it haven’t gone back to thinking how they did before. In an increasingly fragmented media environment, and with conspiracists sitting in positions of huge political power in the US, this is a problem for us all. Rachel Clarke Palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Almost exactly five years ago, Dave Jones, an ICU consultant in Wales, posted a tweet that made NHS colleagues cheer. “The NHS reminds me of a hippopotamus. It might sometimes appear slow, maybe a bit bloated and somewhat unresponsive. But my god, this last week or so has shown that like a hippo, it can move bloody fast and have some awesome power when it needs to.” He had captured brilliantly the breakneck transformation – unprecedented in NHS history – of every inch of the health service to cope with the onslaught of Covid. Hospitals ripped up the rules and demolished conventions to double or treble their ICU capacities. In under a month, 33,000 extra patient beds were created – the equivalent of building 53 new district general hospitals across the country. Barriers dissolved, silos vanished. Red tape – this time of the literal kind – suddenly reconfigured our A&E into “hot” and “cold” zones – the kind of thing that in the NHS normally takes 26 committees and two years to achieve. Money and bureaucracy, for once, were no object. We all worked together to do what was right. What shocks me today is how little of that mind-blowing dynamism remains. Then, staff were unleashed to transform our systems to help patients. Now, we’re back in the old quagmire of inertia, bureaucracy and system-says-no because there’s no money to do anything differently. A new government has promised an NHS revolution, but patients are still dying on trolleys in corridors. Social care – yet again – isn’t a government priority. Trusts still can’t, or won’t, pay for doctors to fill the rota gaps to keep patients safe at night. Staff struggle against the system to give patients the care they deserve. In particular, it astounds me that five years after an airborne virus wreaked such deadly havoc, NHS England has failed to act on all the lessons learned. This winter, NHS leaders loudly blamed a viral “quad-demic” for the appalling crisis conditions in our hospitals, as though somehow natural forces had tied the government’s hands. Yet three of those four viruses – influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Covid-19 – are spread through the air. Why haven’t Hepa filters been installed in all our hospitals and GP surgeries when we know they effectively remove the virus particles breathed in by staff and patients? Where were the universal mask mandates for staff to help reduce the spread? Why was the default mask for staff the flimsy paper variety, not the significantly more protective FFP2 kind? It is surely the falsest of economies to stick to cheap paper when you know this will lead to higher rates of staff infection, endangering patients and causing staff to be too unwell to work. As the Covid inquiry creaks on, I have been unnerved to find myself agreeing with Dominic Cummings’s testimony. Cummings has excoriated the groupthink, inertia and monolithic assumptions that dominate the actions of government, the civil service and the NHS. He’s right. We often talk about those electrifying months, five years ago, when we were liberated – and supported – to make the radical changes our patients needed. If only the same were true now.",

        "text": "PM tells former minister ‘you will have more to contribute’ but says reduction in aid spending is part of ‘protecting our national security’ Downing Street has released the text of Keir Starmer’s response to Anneliese Dodds’ resignation letter. He defends the decision to cut aid spending, saying “protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government”, but praises her work as a minister. “I know you will have more to contribute in the future,” he says, implying a return to government could be possible. Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, has quit her post over Keir Starmer’s decision to slash the international aid budget by almost half to pay for a generational increase in defence spending. Keir Starmer will hold talks with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni in Downing Street on Sunday before a major London defence summit aimed at securing “lasting and enforced” peace in Ukraine. Prisoners may have to earn their freedom through “good behaviour credits” rather than be automatically released after a set period as part of an overhaul being considered by the government. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is holding an urgent meeting on Friday with Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC, after the corporation apologised for “serious flaws” in the making of a documentary about the war in Gaza. Members of the Youth Parliament were probably spared some of the more arcane rules of Commons procedure. In an interview with Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Carla Denyer, the Green party co-leader, complains about it being ‘a club with weird rules”. She is particularly critical of one, which she says amounts to “compulsory participation in prayers in a particular religion [the Church of England]” for MPs who want to take part in debates on busy days. She explains: Your listeners will have seen photos and videos of how packed it gets, especially on budget day or prime minister’s questions. There’s only room for about 450 people to sit down in there, even though there are 650 MPs. So on busy days, you see MPs in the aisles and perching on a step and so on. What I didn’t know until I got elected is that you are not allowed to speak in the chamber unless you’re on one of the main benches. You’re not allowed to take part in the democratic debate. And the way that you make sure you get one of those seats on the benches is to turn up two, three hours before the debate starts, put a prayer card, a little business card with your name on, on the seat you want to sit on, and then you have to turn up for the beginning of prayers. There are Church of England prayers every morning before the debate starts. Now, that’s our state religion. If that’s part of the tradition that happens at the beginning of every day, I don’t have a problem with that in and of itself. But the point is that, if you don’t get there for the beginning of prayers and take part in prayers, then the card gets whipped away and you don’t get to sit down. Therefore you don’t get to take part in the debate … It’s a club with weird rules with, basically, compulsory participation in prayers in a particular religion, whether that’s your faith or not, in order to take part. Members of the Youth Parliament, young people aged between 11 and 18, have been sitting in the Common chamber today to debate a series of issues. It is an annual event that allows them to get experience of the political process and highlight issues of importance to young people. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has said she wants to give elected mayors “sledgehammer” powers so they can smash obstacles to housebuilding in England. In a speech at the Convention of the North in Preston, she said that the planning and infrastracture bill would give regional mayors new powers over housing and regeneration. She went on: All of you in this room are trying – like I am - to get Britain building again. Yes, building houses, but also building your business, building renewable energy, building data centres. All too often, we are met by a system that says: “don’t bother”. Well, I am determined to break that system. And I am handing mayors the sledgehammer! Mayors are at the centre of our plans to build 1.5 million homes, by giving them the powers they need, mayors are an army to take on the blockers. We are backing them to work across huge regional geographies to get the job done. It’s why we’re giving them the powers to call in applications on those large, strategic sites that will really turn the wheel on growth. And it’s why we’re putting grant funding for regeneration and housing in their hands. To enable mayors to deliver on their plans, we will forge a stronger partnership between them and Homes England. Over time, we will move Homes England to a more regionalised model so that the agency is even more responsive to the economic plan of an area. Rayner said the planning bill would be introduced into parliament within weeks. And she said, in areas without a mayor, it would allow councils “to come together and set spatial development strategies”. Aid charities were appalled by the goverment’s decision to slash development spending, and so it is not surprising that many of them have welcomed Anneliese Dodds’ decision to resign over the cuts rather than stay in government to implement them. Here are some of the comments they have been issuing this afternon. From Romilly Greenhill, CEO at Bond, a network representing aid agencies I am sad to see Anneliese Dodds resign - we agree with much of what she has stated in her letter. She was an excellent advocate for women and girls and was dedicated to rebuilding the UK’s reputation on development. We also appreciate the level of engagement she had with the sector. From Kathleen Spencer Chapman, director of influencing and external affairs at Plan International UK We share Annelise Dodds’ extreme disappointment at the prime minister’s shortsighted decision to slash the overseas aid budget. Her resignation shows that the most influential politicians in the Labour Party echo our outrage at the government’s decision to slash an already woefully cut overseas aid budget. From Patrick Watt, CEO at Christian Aid Christian Aid welcomes the strong stand that the now former development minister Anneliese Dodds has taken today against this week’s brutal aid cuts. Dodds has rightly recognised that these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people, will likely lead to a total pull out from many of the world’s poorest countries, and will deeply harm the UK’s reputation and influence globally. We thank Anneliese Dodds for her hard work and commitment in this brief and for the stance she has taken today and we look forward to working with her on the backbenches. Downing Street has released the text of Keir Starmer’s response to Anneliese Dodds’ resignation letter. He defends the decision to cut aid spending, saying “protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government”, but praises her work as a minister. “I know you will have more to contribute in the future,” he says, implying a return to government could be possible. Keir Starmer is preparing to discuss how to guarantee a peace deal in Ukraine will last when he meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Downing Street this weekend, PA Media reports. PA says: Leaders from across Europe will gather in London on Sunday, following a week which will have seen Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron and the Ukrainian president travel for talks with US president Donald Trump. Ahead of Sunday’s summit focused on security, the prime minister will meet with Zelenskyy separately. Starmer returned to the UK today following a trip to the White House which went as well as No 10 could have hoped, with Trump clearly pleased with the king’s invitation for an unprecedented second state visit, giving an indication that he would not block the Chagos Islands deal and suggesting a trade deal could spare British exports from US tariffs. As well as the meeting with Zelenskyy, Sunday will see the prime minister meet separately with Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and chair a call with the Baltic countries – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia – before hosting the summit. Zelenskyy, Macron and Meloni have been invited to the summit along with leaders from Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania, as well as the Nato secretary general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council. They will discuss the next steps in planning for security guarantees if a Ukraine peace deal is reached – something Starmer believes will have to involve the US. The leaders will consider how to strengthen Ukraine’s current position, with military support and increased economic pressure on Russia. The UK wants US military assets to provide surveillance, intelligence and – potentially – warplanes providing air cover to deter Vladimir Putin from launching another bid to conquer his neighbour. The SNP is calling for a Commons vote on the aid cuts announced by Keir Starmer on Tuesday to fund higher defence spending. In a statement issued after Anneliese Dodds’ resignation, Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: Keir Starmer’s wreckless plans to slash UK international aid are strategically damaging, immoral and yet another broken Labour Party manifesto pledge. MPs must be given a vote for such a drastic and harmful step, which rips up decades of vital work, will plunge some of the world’s poorest people further into desperation and may cost lives. The Labour MP Clive Lewis told Radio 4’s World at One that Anneliese Dodds was someone who “doesn’t like to rock the boat” and who would not have resigned lightly. And he suggested that other factors, like the government’s general “direction of travel”, might have influenced her decision. He said: I get the impression from reading her resignation letter that there this was the straw that broke the camel’s back, a rather big straw, but nonetheless it’s one of a series of decisions that have been taken. The direction of travel of our own government has left not just MPs uneasy, but lots of our voter base, and I think it’s something that the prime minister and the cabinet would do well to reflect on. Although Dodds was appointed as Keir Starmer’s first shadow chancellor, and served in that post for about a year, she is more leftwing than he is. Some of Starmer’s supporters wanted him to appointed Rachel Reeves in 2020, but she was deemed unacceptable to the left, and to key trade unions, and that is partly why Dodds got the job instead. Lewis also said he thought it was significant that Dodds, in her resignation letter (see 12.29pm), suggested that Labour should reconsider its fiscal rules and its pledges on tax. He said: I don’t think I got elected … to cut support to the poorest, whether it’s in this country or overseas. And I think what she’s saying is we need to have a conversation, the world is changing, and when it comes to defence, if we want to go beyond 2.4, 2.5%, maybe 3%, maybe beyond, that’s going to require a real conversation about the fiscal rules that we have, about borrowing and about who’s being taxed. You have probably noted that 138 aid agencies have written in saying we should be looking at wealth taxes. Well, that’s something lots of Labour MPs, lots of the public, think should be happening. Lewis said the UK was good at taxing income, but not wealth. That would have to change, said. We tax income extremely well. We don’t tax wealth anywhere near as much. And this is the conversation this government is going to have to have, because whether it comes to public spending domestically or internationally, or on defence, or investment into net zero and all the other things that we now want to do in terms of industrial manufacturing and supply chains, we need to have that resource. Lewis was referring to this letter signed by 138 leaders of in the aid sector. It says: We urgently call on this government to make a statement to parliament, outlining whether the impact of these cuts has been thought through and whether alternative sources of funding were explored before deciding to remove support to those who need it the most. A wealth tax of just 2% on wealth above £10m (affecting just 0.04% of the population) would raise £24bn annually. It is unacceptable that taxing extreme wealth was not looked at before cutting UK aid. A wealth tax on assets above the value of £10m was Green party policy at the last election. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, has defended the government’s decision to cut aid spendng to fund a higher defence budget. Speaking to broadcasters today, she said she was sorry to hear of Anneliese Dodds’ resignation, but went on: It is really difficult decision that was made, but it was absolutely right that the prime minister and the cabinet endorsed the prime minister’s actions to spend more money on defence. We want to see the economy grow so that we can then get back to having more money to spend on things like overseas aid and on our public services. The Liberal Democrats says the government’s cuts to the aid buget are “unsustainable”. In a comment on Anneliese Dodds’ resignation, Monica Harding, the Lib Dem international affairs spokesperson, said: Anneliese Dodds has done the right thing. The government’s position on the international aid cut is unsustainable. Increasing defence spending to 2.5% is the right thing to do as the global threats we face intensify. But doing so by cutting the international aid budget is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. The government hasn’t even carried out an impact assessment. Diplomacy, development and defence are not competing priorities – they are complementary. Where we withdraw our aid, it’s Russia and China who will fill the vacuum. Kemi Badenoch has responded to the news of Anneliese Dodds’ resignation by saying that Keir Starmer was right to slash the aid budget to find higher defence spending. She posted this on social media. I disagree with the PM on many things BUT on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He’s absolutely right. He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him. National interest always comes first. The news coverage of Keir Starmer’s visit to the White House yesterday is overwhelmingly positive. But in the comment pages, the verdict is a lot more nuanced. Here are extracts from five articles on the visit that are worth a read. Stephen Bush in the Financial Times says the postive aspects of the trip don’t alter the fundamental difficulties. You can see the outlines of something that works for all concerned, in policy terms: the UK government continues to buy technology that it thinks is top-of-the-range, it signs some sort of deal trumpeting that, and it avoids tariffs — trebles all round in Downing Street and the Foreign Office. But: the big picture political thing that the UK government and essentially all of Europe wants is some sign that the combined Macron-Starmer charm offensive might do anything to pull Trump and the US back into the defence of Europe. That didn’t happen. I don’t think anyone reasonably expected that mission to succeed (there is a reason why Starmer already has another appointment in his diplomatic calendar to meet fellow European leaders) but nevertheless, this remains the single biggest problem facing the UK and its neighbours. In addition, the long-term politics of all this look very fraught. Labour’s liberal base is essentially being asked to stomach: a) a rhetorically warm relationship with a president it hates b) slow, and in some policy areas, non-existent progress on domestic social policy c) cuts to the overseas development budget to finance increases in defence spending. Freddie Hayward at the New Statesman says the real story from the trip is about Britain’s weakness. Before No 10 commission a triumphal arch on the Mall, remember the Prime Minister was there to get a security guarantee for Ukraine. What happened? As expected, Trump dismissed the idea of even providing air cover, and instead said the presence of American workers, presumably mining Ukraine’s rare earths, will deter any “playing around”. Trump does not want American troops in danger on Europe’s eastern flank … The real story of Starmer’s trip was, therefore, British weakness. Look at what was done, not what was said. Flattery occluded the material realities; diplomatic procedure papered over uncouth power imbalances. Those taken in by the sweet words Trump offered to the Prime Minister in the Oval Office should remember that the US president once wrote love letters to Kim Jong Un; that for the first time since 1945 the US voted with Russia, North Korea and Belarus at the UN last week; and that JD Vance has said attacks on free speech in the UK meant the US was questioning whether it was even worth protecting its allies. David Blair in the Telegraph says three words from Trump made the trip a success. With three vital words, Donald Trump made Sir Keir Starmer’s visit to the White House a success. “I support it,” said the president, when asked whether he backed Article V of the Nato treaty, which binds the US and every other member to come to the defence of any ally. Barely a fortnight after Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, sent tremors through Europe by appearing to suggest that America’s commitment to Nato was conditional and wavering, Mr Trump offered reassurance … At one point, Mr Trump turned to Sir Keir and asked, half jokingly, whether Britain could take on Russia alone. Despite the warm words, the message was clear: never forget your dependence on America. But Ian Dunt in a post on his Substack blog draws the opposite conclusion, and argues that what Trump said showed Nato is not safe. Keir Starmer’s visit to the White House yesterday was generally well received. The British right were thwarted in their clear desire to see Donald Trump publicly humiliate him. There was a fairly warm reception to the Chagos deal and some mention of avoiding tariffs. That all secured some rare front page praise today, with the Mail saying “what an unlikely bromance”, the Telegraph saying “Trump backs Starmer on Chagos” and the Times emphasising a possible trade deal. The PM’s team will consider that a good day at work. Britain is managing to hide in the undergrowth while this demented gorilla goes on the warpath. Unfortunately, none of it means anything. The one supreme matter of historic importance at the moment concerns American security guarantees for Ukraine. Without them, there is no Nato. Without them, there is a significantly increased incentive for Russia to continue a policy of imperial expansionism. Without them, we inch closer and closer to European powers entering into direct military conflict with Russia. But on this point Starmer failed to secure any meaningful assurance at all, just like Emmanuel Macron earlier in the week. You can’t fault either man. They did their best. But the basic truth is that they came back empty handed. “Could you take on Russia by yourselves?” Trump asked Starmer yesterday, a vicious reptilian smile plastered across his face. And in that joke, and the laughter that surrounded it, was the death of Nato, the end of any meaningful US commitment to Europe, the rejection of a united West, a once-great power turned into a small dog that bares its stomach to Russian tyranny. Gaby Hinsliff in the Guardian says this is no longer a “special relationship”. Starmer laid on the flattery with the recommended trowel, handing over an invitation from King Charles for an unprecedented second state visit that evidently delighted the president. But though Trump praised him as a ‘special man’, this no longer feels like a special relationship; more the kind of loveless transaction that leaves both sides feeling grubby. Green party parliamentarians are also praising Anneliese Dodds for her decision to resign over the government’s cuts to the aid budget. This is from Adrian Ramsay, the party’s co-leader A principled decision by Anneliese Dodds. And she’s right. Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget will prevent crucial support to war-torn countries. Support that is vital for our security. The Prime Minister’s decision is a dereliction of duty And this is from Natalie Bennett, a Green peer and former party leader Principles in politics. What a refreshing sight!\n   Much respect to Anneliese Dodds.#AidCuts And this is from the Lib Dem peer Chris Rennard A courageous and correct decision mirroring the resignation of Baroness Sugg when Boris Johnson cut the overseas aid budget. We need to assist with development to help the world’s poorest, create stability, and use soft power effectively. Andrew Mitchell, a former Tory international develpment secretary, has praised Anneliese Dodds for resigning. As Patrick Wintour reports, Mitchell said: Anneliese has done the right thing. Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean Labour’s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the world’s poorest. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of principle and decency. As Patrick Wintour, Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, the cuts to the aid budget announced on Tueday, that triggered Anneliese Dodds’ resignation, will take UK development spending to its lowest level as a percentage of national income since records began, an analysis says. Here is a profile of Anneliese Dodds by Kiran Stacey.",

        "title": "Second US company recalls pet food as bird flu spreads to cats through tainted meat | US news | The Guardian",
        "text": "Cats in two states tested positive after eating raw food from Wild Coast Raw, which issued voluntary recall As the bird flu outbreak continues gaining force in the US, a second company selling raw pet food issued a voluntary recall after cats from two different households in Oregon contracted H5N1 from the tainted meat earlier this month. Two more cats in different households in Washington state have tested positive for bird flu after eating the same brand of raw pet food nearly two weeks after the recall, officials announced on Wednesday. One cat was euthanized, while the other remains under veterinary care. Two lots of the raw food, made by Wild Coast Raw, fall under the voluntary recall. It is not clear whether the new cases in Washington are linked to recalled lots or others. Since 2022 in the US, nearly 100 domestic cats have tested positive for bird flu, which can be fatal, and it may be possible for cats to transmit the virus to humans. On 6 February, Christine “Kiki” Knopp noticed one of her 11 cats was running a slight fever. Within days, two of her cats had to be euthanized, and a third was in an intensive care unit. All of the cats that had eaten raw pet food would later test positive for bird flu. Only a male cat kept apart from the others and fed canned food stayed negative. Knopp is an artist in Portland, Oregon, who breeds and shows Cornish Rex cats. She has fed raw food to all but the male cat for years, and watched recent notices about tainted raw pet food carefully. She believed the food from Wild Coast was being tested for H5N1. “I’ve since learned, I don’t think there’s really a safe way to trust if someone says they’re testing it,” she said. Wild Coast did not respond to the Guardian’s media inquiries about why the company waited a week to issue a voluntary recall after being notified of possible contamination, and whether it was reaching out to vendors and customers about the recall. If Knopp had known, she would have “immediately” switched to canned food – a move she now recommends to all cat owners who were feeding raw food they bought or made on their own. “It is not safe,” she said. “Immediately: do not feed raw poultry or raw chicken, raw any table scraps, to cats currently – not even raw eggs.” Raw milk is similarly risky, since milk can contain enormous amounts of virus, and raw beef has also been found to harbor H5N1. “Especially right now, feeding raw food is just all risk,” said Steve Valeika, a small-animal veterinarian with a public health background. H5N1 joins a host of other pathogens – including salmonella, E coli, campylobacter, listeria and toxoplasmosis – that have been associated with raw pet food. One of the most unnerving parts for Knopp: her cats never displayed the classic symptoms of respiratory infections, like congestion. Some of the cats had fevers, rapid breathing and eyelid swelling, and one eventually had difficulty walking – a sign of neurological impairment. But nothing pointed to influenza until X-rays revealed two of the cats with rapid breathing had developed severe pneumonia. That’s when they tested for bird flu. “Your average person probably wouldn’t take them to the vet with a minor fever that comes and goes,” Knopp said. “Your average person might not notice a sudden increase of breath rate, especially for a cat that’s maybe more reclusive. So I wonder how many cases are also under-reported.” Knopp was concerned that she might become infected and spread the virus herself. Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion “I don’t want to be known as ‘Bird Flu Mary’,” she said. Her local health department conducted daily symptom check-ins, she started wearing face masks when she went out in public, and she requested a test to see if she had gotten sick. The result was negative for influenza A and B. In 2016, cats in a New York City shelter transmitted H7N2 to at least one person. “We know that cats can at least transmit another strain of bird flu directly to people,” Valeika said. “I do think these cats potentially present some risk to humans. We don’t have any idea how big that risk is, but it’s definitely one that should be taken seriously until we know better.” It is not clear how tainted poultry is entering the raw pet food supply. All facilities processing meat for humans are inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). While some meat intended for pets flows through FSIS-inspected facilities, “obviously, a great deal of protein is produced outside of FSIS-inspected facilities and is never intended for human consumption”, said Eric Deeble, deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, on 16 January during the last call health officials held with reporters. US officials were investigating whether any of the H5-positive pet products had gone through such a facility, he said, though no results have been released to the public yet. “Birds from affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA’s efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all,” Deeble said. Valeika added that he had “no good idea as to why we’re seeing so many sick birds making it into the [pet] food supply – because this must just be the tip of the iceberg”. There are other steps pet owners can take to protect animals, and themselves, from bird flu, Valeika said: don’t let cats outside, and don’t let dogs hunt or play with birds, including in ponds and lakes frequented by migratory birds. Mice and rats, especially near dairy and poultry farms, have also tested positive for H5N1. Knopp has been posting about her experiences and holding “ask me anything” sessions about cats and bird flu on social media. “I’ve channeled a lot of grief into work and into education,” she said. For the two cats who were euthanized, she said, “their death gets to mean something. It can save other animals. It can save some people grief.”",

        "title": "US shutdown of HIV/Aids funding ‘could lead to 500,000 deaths in South Africa’ | Global development | The Guardian",
        "text": "USAid cuts to clinics dispensing antiretroviral drugs will be ‘death sentence for mothers and children’, expert warns Sweeping notices of termination of funding have been received by organisations working with HIV and Aids across Africa, with dire predictions of a huge rise in deaths as a result. After the US announced a permanent end to funding for HIV projects, services across the board have been affected, say doctors and programme managers, from projects helping orphans and pregnant women to those reaching transgender individuals and sex workers. The cuts could result in 500,000 deaths over the next 10 years in South Africa, modelling suggests, while thousands of people are already set to lose their jobs in the coming days. The US government has announced it will be cutting more than 90% of the contracts of its key development agency, USAid, and slashing $60bn (£48bn) of overseas aid spending. The Guardian has heard that notices of termination have been sent to organisations in other countries in the region, including Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, as well as with the joint United Nations programme UNAids. The Elizabeth Glaser Paediatric Aids Foundation said it had received termination notices for three of its projects, which provide HIV treatment for more than 350,000 people in Lesotho, Eswatini and Tanzania. The figure includes more than 10,000 HIV-positive pregnant women, who must continue taking antiretroviral drugs to avoid passing the disease on to their babies. Dr Lynne Mofenson, a senior adviser at the foundation, said the decision was “a death sentence for mothers and children”. Many projects had been forced to stop work in late January after the Trump administration announced a 90-day review of foreign aid. A few were then granted temporary waivers to continue on the grounds that they provided life-saving services, before receiving notices on Thursday instructing them to close their doors permanently. Projects funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), founded by George W Bush in 2003, appear to be particularly affected. In South Africa it funds 17% of the HIV response; in other countries the figure is much higher. Prof Linda-Gail Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town, said: “It is not hyperbole to say that I predict a huge disaster.” Bekker has worked on modelling suggesting a complete loss of Pepfar funding in South Africa would lead to more than 500,000 extra HIV deaths over a decade. It comes at a time when scientific breakthroughs, such as the introduction of long-acting injectable prevention drugs, meant many working in the HIV field had hoped an end to the disease might be in sight. Now, said Bekker, it was likely things would go backwards. South Africa has about 8 million people living with HIV, the highest number globally. She said she had initially expected the US to target programmes working with key groups of people such as the LGBT+ community, because of the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity initiatives, “but in fact, this has been across the board. “This is children, this is orphans, vulnerable children, young women and girl programmes. It is generic and across the board.” It also halts ongoing research, including trials into potential HIV vaccines and new prevention drugs, Bekker said. US funding had allowed projects to fill gaps in government provision, such as clinics where transgender people or sex workers can seek care without stigma or legal concerns, Bekker said. Kholi Buthelezi, national coordinator at Sisonke, a sex workers’ organisation, said: “I’ve been having sleepless nights. This blow, it reminded us of back when there was no cure for HIV.” At a press briefing on the cuts, she and others working on HIV in South Africa called on their government to “step up” and fill the gaps left by the US’s withdrawal. Pepfar funding has been distributed via USAid and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Programmes with funding from the CDC have not yet been forced to shut, said Dr Kate Rees, a public health medicine specialist at the Anova Health Institute, but said it was too early to conclude that those programmes were safe. There had already been plans to shift programmes reliant on donors to government funding over the next five years, Rees said, but “now, instead of a careful handover, we’re being pushed over a cliff edge”. US funding had been embedded in the health system, she said, and so the withdrawal would “be felt by everyone who uses or works in health services”. Anova has received a termination notice. “Tomorrow we are letting go more than 2,800 people,” Rees said. “That’s counsellors, data capturers, healthcare workers – and these people are not going to find other jobs very easily.”",

        "title": "After a week of turmoil, one thing needs saying about our NHS: slowly it is healing | Polly Toynbee | The Guardian",
        "text": "Times are tough and funding remains below the historic average, but in key areas there are welcome signs of hope Reorganisation – or re-disorganisation – is the perennial disease in the NHS. If I listed all the structural acronyms throughout the decades, and the new staff starting new jobs with new brass nameplates, it would fill this page. This week, Wes Streeting accepted the resignation of NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, after ousting its chair, Richard Meddings, signalling an effective merger in all but name with Streeting’s own department. Whitehall says NHS England will have “a smaller, leaner role”, with thousands of duplicated jobs lost. Few people will regret the swallowing up of this remnant of the disastrous 2012 Lansley reforms, which fragmented everything in the NHS. Pritchard and Meddings recently suffered an unwarranted pasting by the Commons public accounts and health committees for their lack of “ideas”, but that was hardly fair. They had been barred from revealing the health department’s imminent 10-year plan. And there is a truth that the committees ignored that bears stating here: the NHS is on the turn for the better. Jim Mackey takes over NHS England, and even those who say Pritchard got the push unfairly tell me they welcome his arrival. Currently CEO of Newcastle hospitals foundation trust, he was head of NHS Improvement with a record of innovation until it was abolished by one of the three Tory health secretaries passing through in 2022. It’s also worth saying that Pritchard suffered six changes of health secretary in three and half years. I interviewed Mackey two years ago when he had returned to Northumbria healthcare trust, to start a pioneering scheme that others now copy. Failure to bind social care with the NHS leaves more than 13,000 beds in England taken up by old people waiting for a care package. Mackey set up a care system within his trust to relieve hospital bed shortages. His Northumbria Care is an NHS-owned domiciliary service that bids for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers, seamlessly integrating care within the health service. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, and every incentive to stop patients needing a hospital bed, and to get them home quicker. He planned to build care homes to take over residential contracts too, if he could raise the capital. The idea short-circuits the cumbersome introduction of 42 integrated care boards (ICBs). They were designed to bring local services together, but are largely regarded as failing. They lack the clout to knock local heads together so that GP and community services integrate with hospitals. They have no power over integrating local authority social care. Half the ICBs are in debt; they may yet be merged into half that number. Rarely has top talent moved from hospitals to run ICBs. Instead, many hospitals are forming groups, which may work better than ICBs. These are not big-bang changes and they slide under the radar, but the Mackey model has inspired other trusts to try similar schemes: expect more of that thinking from him. The Darzi report laid bare the state of the NHS Labour inherited. Austerity cut everything, including medical training, with huge gaps in staff as the NHS struggled to cope with the effects of deprivation and a far sicker population. Streeting is rightly wary of boasting about any progress yet, given public outrage over the still appalling waiting lists (7.46 million cases, according to the British Medical Association), as well as ambulance delays, and ailing A&E and GP services. The Treasury, meanwhile, seems happy to say that NHS productivity is lagging and that extra money ploughed in is failing to produce enough improvement. But that’s not the whole story, and the NHS should speak up. The Treasury traditionally sees the NHS as a bottomless pit, but its productivity is being badly misrepresented with faulty Office for National Statistics figures that are eagerly seized on by enemies of the NHS on the right. Anita Charlesworth, senior economist at the Health Foundation thinktank, says ONS figures only count acute hospital activity, leaving out the 12,000 new virtual hospital-at-home beds. These are costly, but less expensive than actual hospital beds. The stats leave out GP care. Productivity there is rising fast now that GPs are paid to seek advice from specialists, instead of automatically referring patients to them directly: 1.5 million fewer patients have been referred, the department tells me. Instead, they are being cared for in surgeries under guidance. That GP productivity should be counted in. The department’s own figures show waiting lists falling and the 2m extra appointments promised within a year have been provided months early, with surgical hubs working evenings and weekends, as well as new diagnostic units. In his last month as chair, Meddings points to widespread improvements, a service “overwhelmed”, but not “broken”, he tells me. GP appointments are rising fast: 98% of surgeries have digital phones ensuring every call is answered, or called back promptly, with half the callers getting same-day appointments, and 70% face-to-face consultations. April’s year end figures will show “NHS productivity up 2.5%, more than any other public service”, Meddings said. He echoed the curious optimism you often hear throughout the NHS, even from those who describe near-impossible tasks undertaken to cope with rising need. Keep perspective. Trolleys line many A&E corridors, ambulance delays persist, waiting times are horrendous. I hear laments from managers and medics facing the prospect of 4% “efficiency savings” next year, to be achieved on top of already existing deficits, which must also be cleared. (Spoiler alert: they won’t be.) But there is hope. Times are tough and funding remains below the NHS historic average. But, as the Health Foundation’s Charlesworth says, this is not a repeat of the NHS austerity years. Statistics are just that, and what they represent cuts through very slowly, so it will take a long time before the public feels and believes in progress. But, for all the turmoil, green shoots are there. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

        "title": "Watching my cancer patients go through treatment alone is heartbreaking | Lucy Gossage | The Guardian",
        "text": "Covid-19 has made this year tougher for those experiencing treatment and those of us who work in cancer care In March, just before the UK locked down, I speculated about the challenges Covid-19 might pose to people undergoing cancer treatment. Now, with apprehension building as we dive headfirst into the second wave of Covid-19, I reflect on my past seven months as an oncologist. There is no doubt that 2020 has made life for those living with cancer even harder. It’s also become tougher for those of us who work in cancer care. We’ve had to adapt our communication skills. For some patients, the shift to phone consultations is a welcome change. For others, a phone call removes the small talk part of consultations, where doctors and patients get to know each other. A physical examination tells us more about our patients than the physical findings alone. The silences we so often employ in face to face conversations, generally intuitively without conscious thought, are awkward on the telephone. Video consultations are better, but do not equate to real life. We would never normally start difficult, life-changing conversations with the words: “Can you hear me?” Learning to communicate behind a mask, without touch, has been hideous. It’s hard to describe how difficult it is to tell someone their treatment has stopped working, standing two metres away with facial expressions hidden. I hadn’t appreciated just how important non-verbal cues are until they were taken away. Asking difficult and important questions has become harder, so much so that I’ve sometimes subconsciously avoided them. One day in the summer, the specialist nurse I work with and I had to tell a teenager and his parents his treatment had stopped working and there were no more options. There is never an easy way to do this, but we did our best to deliver this impossible news compassionately, in the quiet room on the teenage young adolescent ward, albeit behind masks. Some time later, his mother and I went to the roof terrace to talk more. I suggested that maybe, since we were outside, we could take off our masks. For the first time in months, I felt we could speak like humans; I could express properly, from my heart, how much I wished I could have done more to help her son. As she stood up to leave we hugged. For me, this hug said more than any words ever could. This is what oncology used to be like. This is the oncology I yearn for. One of the things I’ve found hardest has been watching people go through cancer treatment on their own, without the support of friends and families. Imagine spending three months in hospital undergoing intensive chemotherapy without your wife and children being allowed to visit. Imagine getting the phone call that your husband has become so overwhelmed by cancer that doctors have had to put a tube into his airway to help him breathe, but not be able to visit. Imagine being in your early 20s, knowing you have just a few months to live, and making the difficult decision to try chemotherapy in the hope that it will extend your life just enough for you to spend some weekends with friends when lockdown ends. And then discovering the chemotherapy hasn’t worked, and you’ve spent your final few months in and out of hospital, alone, without the opportunity to do the things that made you happy. Imagine being so scared of coronavirus that, even though you’ve finished your treatment, you’re terrified to leave your house to take your children to the park. Or being told that you might die, but not being allowed visitors until you’re days from death. Imagine, in your 30s, going to a hospice as a bridge to dying at home and not being allowed visitors even there. Imagine watching this heartache week in, week out. Early on in the pandemic, we were asked to prioritise cancer treatments from priority one (curative treatment) to priority six (non-curative treatment with a small chance of palliation or temporary tumour control). So far I’ve been lucky. Where I work, we were never so limited by capacity that we had to use this categorisation to prioritise treatments. I may have had to advise against some treatments we would usually recommend. That’s because we now consider the risks outweigh the benefits. But I never had to tell a patient I was not able to offer treatment because we didn’t have the resources to provide it. Some colleagues elsewhere were not as fortunate. As we enter Covid round two, this is again a real fear for all of us, particularly as increasing numbers of us have to isolate. The NHS does not have the spare staff capacity to deal with excessive absences. I dread the day that I have to tell a patient I can’t offer them a treatment because there are not enough pharmacists to make it, or enough chemotherapy nurses to deliver it. I hope this day never comes. The NHS has learned from Covid round one. We know more and we’re better equipped. But we’re also tired. The three-month reprieve in the summer has allowed us to recharge our emotional batteries somewhat, but we are far from 100%. If we started round one fresh, motivated and full of adrenaline, we enter round two tired, perhaps even jaded. We’ve only just finished one marathon. We’re not yet ready to run another. But we will get through this. People always do. Day in, day out, our patients show us the extraordinary psychological strength of humans thrown into adversity.

        "text": "I was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital where I work as a surgeon. This is how I recovered I am a surgeon who is well respected in their field, with a long list of awards on my CV. But my greatest achievement is largely a secret: rebuilding my life after I tried to end it. It has been five years since I was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital where I work. I had developed severe depression and become convinced that my only way out was to die. When I woke up after my suicide attempt a week later, I had a tube down my throat and the shape of the defibrillator pads burned on to my chest. “We saved you,” the people working there said. I politely thanked them then asked for a ‘not for resuscitation’ form so they wouldn’t try again. I first realised I was depressed a few months before I tried to kill myself. I had been feeling low for a long time and things began to spiral after the end of a relationship and moving into an apartment alone. I went to see my GP and started taking antidepressants. I booked to see a counsellor. But the feelings just got worse. I would be smiling and laughing on the outside, but on the inside was a continuous mantra of self-loathing that kept getting louder. I pushed myself harder, took extra shifts, tried to put my head down and just get through it. One day, I had had enough. The pain had become physical as well as mental, and the idea of having to live any longer was unbearable. I took an overdose. My last thoughts were of my family and how much I loved them.\n When I woke up and found I was still alive, I was devastated. My memory of the first week is patchy; I was sedated and recovering from pneumonia after having swallowed my own vomit during cardiac arrest. My sister told me I was terrified all the time. I was discharged to my parents’ house and sent to see a psychiatrist. My family looked broken. They tried to smile but they had sat by my bedside and watched my heart stop over and over again. My pain had become their pain. I was referred to a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I started weekly therapy. I slowly learned to live with my feelings rather than try to suppress them or distract myself with work. It was extremely hard digging through years of painful feelings and memories. Often I would feel worse at the end of a therapy session than I had coming in. But eventually I began to feel better. I found an antidepressant that suited me. I learned how liberating it was to say honestly how I was feeling. I learned how to ask for help and to go easier on myself when I was struggling. I realised just how much my friends and family cared for me and how much they wanted me to get better. This gave me the strength to keep trying. After a few months, I went back to work, initially part-time and then full-time. There were plenty of challenges. I had to consult on a patient on the same ICU that I had been on. He was 19 and had also tried to end his life. He was brain dead and being assessed for organ donation. His family were devastated. I managed to perform the assessments needed before leaving the room in tears. Others I knew quietly shared their experience of depression with me. It’s a lot more common in medicine than I had realised. We all face the difficulties of losing patients, long hours and a lack of autonomy. Several of my colleagues confidentially shared that they took antidepressants. Very few had had the opportunity to attend counselling, since this would have required taking time off work. Mental health is still stigmatised, even within the medical profession. I discovered that medical staff often display signs of depression differently to others and keep working right up until they break; work brings comfort from the feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Five years on, I am grateful to be alive. It took a few years before I could say that. I still have bad days, but I live a full life and it doesn’t hurt to be alive anymore. I’ve learned that when times are tough, I need to talk about how I’m feeling. I tell my support network if there are challenges coming up in my life so they know to check in with me more closely. I’d like to think I’ve become a better friend and a better listener. I’ve learned to be more open with people and share the bad times as well as the good ones. The more I have opened up and shown my own vulnerabilities, the more others have felt able to show theirs and we have been able to support one another. I no longer feel alone.

        "text": "He has stayed with me for 25 years, even though I’ve left my job as a doctor in the NHS The night shift in A&E started off as normal: routine heart attacks, head injuries, road traffic accidents, an array of minor injuries. It was what happened next that has stayed with me for 25 years, long after I left my job as a doctor in the NHS. I can’t remember exactly when the unmistakably shrill sound of the trauma bleep went off, but I do recall feeling a familiar churning in my stomach. Was it excitement? Or was it a sense of foreboding, a warning that something bad was about to happen, something hard to stomach and impossible to erase? I looked up at the arrivals screen: “Trauma, patient moribund, ETA three minutes” were the only clues I had as I walked quickly to the resus room to set up my tray of equipment. One by one, my colleagues arrived; there were no “how are you’s?” or pleasantries, no banter or gossip. There was just an eerie silence as we rushed to prepare so that we could be ready to jump into action as soon as the patient arrived. The anaesthetist arrived and, amid the continuous bleeping of ECG machines, we were quickly given our roles and instructions. The anaesthetist would take head, neck and airway, I was to take IV access and pain relief, the orthopaedics were ready to assess limbs and spine, the surgeon was to assess the abdomen, and so on. I listened carefully as I gowned and gloved up, my hands trembling. What seemed like several long moments later, the paramedics rushed in with the patient on a trolley. The loud, firm, pressured voice of the paramedic said: “Twenty-nine-year old Caucasian male, severe burns to entire body from a house fire, past medical history includes mental health ...” His voice faded as I took in the screaming, writhing body that was attached to a spinal board and covered in head-to-toe burns. The acrid smell of charred flesh and burnt hair still haunted me for several weeks afterwards, and I will never be able to stop hearing the screaming. A familiar feeling descended over me – a calm, determined autopilot where somehow, after repeated exams, courses and emergency experience, I knew exactly what to do. “We need access, morphine and fluids …” I heard the anaesthetist’s firm instructions over the screaming and thrashing as he held oxygen over the patient’s face. The nurse restrained the patient’s arm as I applied a tourniquet above the elbow; the burnt skin came away under my thumb but underneath I felt the familiar give of what I hoped was a vein. I was handed a grey cannula and on a wing and a prayer plunged it into the skin. A flashback of blood showed that access was secured and within seconds his rigid, desperate, clasping limbs suddenly softened and relaxed as the opiates took effect. My colleagues jumped into action to sedate him, secure an airway, carry out limb and abdominal assessments, ventilation and cardiorespiratory monitoring, and place lines and tubes. We worked to stabilise the patient so he could be transferred to intensive care. As the trolley was loaded with equipment and carefully wheeled out of resus, I prayed a silent hopeless prayer. I couldn’t see how he could survive. The debriefing was filled with a stunned silence, as the consultant asked if we were OK. We looked at the floor in what could only have been a mixture of horror and bravado and replied: “Yes.” He spoke but I remember very little of what was said and after a few minutes our trauma team disbanded to go about the rest of our night shift, a part of each of us also scarred and changed forever. I’m not sure why this patient has lived on in my memory. Perhaps it was the fact we were a similar age; at a time when I felt invincible, his life was taken from him. He fought for his life for several weeks, but survived only in my thoughts and the hearts of his loved ones. Years later I was again reminded of him and my own mortality as I myself recovered from mental health issues. My thoughts turn to my friends and colleagues on the frontline of a global pandemic, and I fear for their wellbeing. They are also dealing with trauma, but don’t have the time to process it. In more recent times, debriefing and counselling of healthcare workers has become available but it is by no means routine. My hope is that immediate funding for a national framework of in-house support and counselling will stem the tsunami of mental ill health among frontline workers that I envisage coming, and shed light on the ultimate medical taboo that is the mental health of our healthcare staff.

        "title": "My husband is in a care home. I visit him for 30 minutes each week in a car park | Anonymous | The Guardian",
        "text": "I understand visits must be restricted because of Covid, but why are families the ones to suffer? My husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease eight years ago. I vowed to look after him and never put him in a home. Three years on, after sleepless nights, mental and physical exhaustion, and the sensation that I was disintegrating, I faced the hard truth: I was not the best person to look after my husband any more. After a long and heartbreaking search I found my husband’s present care home, and shed tears of relief. The staff are loving and well-trained in dementia care. My husband is happy: he loves them all, and is well-liked and treated with respect. Before lockdown, I spent three days a week there and took him out walking, sightseeing, to restaurants. He received plenty of stimulation and I am convinced that the dementia was slowed down. We led a full and pleasant life. Relatives came and went as they pleased. The care workers were like friends to us all. But when coronavirus struck, everything changed radically. Visits to care homes stopped and I didn’t see my husband for four months. I Skyped him every day, playing him music, and though he has lost the power of coherent speech he chatted away and was alert and engaged with me. When testing became more widespread, visits resumed in August. The home gave us a visiting policy, based on the very broad government and local authority guidelines. It is long, repetitive and often self-contradicting. At a Zoom conference held by the management we were promised a personalised visiting plan, based on our unique circumstances. We were given a questionnaire asking what form of visiting we preferred and where visits should be held. It was indicated that we could hug our loved ones. The reality was very different. There was to be just one visitor, the same one for each visit. Visits were to be 30 minutes per resident per week in a tent in the busy car park, separated by a large table, behind a large plastic screen. We wore masks. No touching, no hugging. My feelings lunge from one extreme to another. My husband is alive, whereas several of his fellow residents died of coronavirus. The care home does not employ agency staff who move between homes. Much care is taken to keep infection out of the home and visiting footfall is restricted to essential workers. The care staff are friendly and welcoming, and as lovely and clever as they always were. They risked their lives to look after my husband when they had no personal protective equipment and no testing. They could have run away but did not. I am happy and grateful. But human rights have been abandoned in the fight against Covid-19 and I have no say in anything concerning him unless the managers allow it. I can’t be close to him, touch him, eat with him, go for a walk with him, or do anything but sit for 30 minutes behind a screen, singing, acting, joking, just to stimulate him and try to stop him forgetting who I am. He can never see his daughters or his grandchildren and they can never see him. The attitude of the managers has become more authoritarian though they are still polite and friendly. Many of my questions are dodged or go unanswered. When I persist I am told: “We are following government guidelines.” There is a reluctance to engage in discussion, and announcements are made on the home’s website which affect my whole life and that of our family, with no discussion possible. Those in charge of visiting interpret the rules in their own way. Once, having booked through the compulsory channel, my visit was then vetoed and cancelled for no clear reason by another employee. The effect was devastating. Now I almost fear turning up for my visit to my own husband. Why am I and other relatives not allowed into the care home? Maintenance people, suppliers, care staff who have children and spouses, people who may be going out and about in public (as they are entitled to be) are all allowed in. I am older, don’t go out anywhere much and am very careful to socially distance, as are probably most other relatives. We’re probably the people least likely to spread infection. Surely my husband’s mental and physical health matter more than maintaining the gardens? He could walk for miles four months ago and now he can barely totter to the tent, supported by two care workers. His powers of concentration and alertness are leaving him and he often can’t focus his attention. Of course I agree with the policy in general, but our care homes are mainly private and for profit, however well run they are. Their reputation is their chief asset. Filling places is paramount to the homes’ financial survival. If Covid spreads through the home it might go out of business, so the most conservative approach is adopted. And the families are the easiest targets. We are afraid for our loved ones. We are afraid to make waves for their sake. So we are the “footfall” that is easiest to get rid of.

        "text": "I’m still grappling with the long-term impact of my diagnosis but am determined to help others as a cancer researcher I was 14 and on holiday with my family when I became ill. In two weeks, I lost a huge amount of weight and could barely stand without passing out. When we got home I had blood tests before being transferred to Southampton general hospital, where it was confirmed I had leukaemia and needed six months of intensive chemotherapy treatment. I was a young patient, but I was keen to know everything about my diagnosis and my consultants got used to my constant questioning. One of my favourites was Dr Mary Morgan. Some consultants would ignore me and talk directly to my parents, but she always treated me like an adult. She even agreed to take me to the lab to see my blood being analysed. Although I liked science at school, I wasn’t necessarily good at it. But when it was real-life science happening to me, I found it fascinating. That trip to the lab with Mary was when I first realised I wanted to become a scientist. After four cycles of treatments, I went into remission. Going back to school and facing GCSEs after so much time away was nerve-racking, but it was also so great to be back to normal again. I had been clear of cancer for three years and was studying for my A-levels when I woke up one morning feeling off. Stumbling and weak, I collapsed in the bathroom, smashing my head on the basin. My family picked me up and took me straight to hospital. They told me it was leukaemia again. This time I needed a bone marrow transplant. A match was found after eight weeks on the transplant register. They warned me treatment was going to be harder, but I didn’t take it seriously because I’d coped so well in the past. Nothing had prepared me for the process to prepare for the transplant, though. Total body irradiation – killing off all of my bone marrow through radiotherapy. I remember lying on my hospital bed telling my mum I couldn’t do it anymore. I was exhausted but couldn’t sleep. I could feel everything shutting down inside me. I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognise the person I saw. I took a full academic year off in between the first and second year of A-levels to have my transplant. When I returned, I spent all my free periods and breaks in the library so I could achieve the best grades possible and get into university. Cancer had dominated my life by this point – but it was all I wanted to choose as a career. I didn’t want any 14-year-old to go through the same thing I had. After a degree in biomedical sciences and a master’s in cancer sciences, I started my PhD in cancer research, looking for answers about what happened to me. When I finished in 2018, I began work as a researcher on Cancer Research UK-funded trials at the same hospital where I was treated as a child. The inspirational women who looked after me then are still a part of my life. Mary is now retired and came to my wedding last year. Dr Juliet Gray, a registrar (now consultant) on the paediatric oncology ward when I was first admitted at 14, offered me work experience at her lab prior to my PhD. I now work alongside her on clinical trials. Juliet was there the whole time throughout both of my treatments. I remember once when I was visiting the hospital as a day patient, I came down with a serious infection. My blood pressure dropped and I was about to be sent to intensive care. She was on call, stepped in and managed to stabilise me. My work is focused on immunotherapy clinical trials. This type of treatment teaches your immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells and may result in fewer long-term side effects. After my transplant I remember I was given a four-page list of possible side effects. At 17 it didn’t register. I was so desperate to be rid of the cancer that all thoughts of the long-term impact of treatment went out the window. Now I’m older, I’m dealing with the reality. I faced a third cancer diagnosis two years ago – a mild form of skin cancer that was a byproduct of my treatment as a teenager – and I’m infertile as a result of my bone marrow transplant. I also went through the menopause at 17. I never cared much before, but now it matters. After I met my now husband my priorities shifted. Suddenly all I wanted was to grow old with him and be able to raise a family. I want to see the day that children and young people going through cancer can come through the other side and be able to live well, not just survive with a lifetime of side effects from the treatment they had. People shouldn’t have to choose survival at the expense of being able to live – there has to be a better outcome than that.

        "title": "I'm disabled but was told I won't receive critical care if I get Covid. It's terrifying | Anonymous as told to Sarah Johnson | The Guardian",
        "text": "I use a ventilation machine at night and by early March, I could see that if I were to catch coronavirus, I’d be in serious trouble Towards the end of last year, I’d just got my life back on track after a long stay in hospital. I was discharged with round-the-clock care that transformed my life. I am disabled and the care package I was on before I was admitted to hospital didn’t provide enough support; I was admitted to a ward with problems associated with a lack of care, including malnutrition and serious pressure sores. But then I was given a personal health budget from my local authority, with responsibility for employing care workers, rotas, management, training and everything else you can think of. As a result I got off benefits and into employment – but then Covid struck. By February I was alert to the threat that coronavirus posed to me. I’m in a wheelchair. I use a ventilation machine at night and by early March, I could see that if I were to catch Covid-19, I’d be in serious trouble. I had to furlough one valued care worker because she also worked in a busy shop. I felt the risk was too high. Another went abroad and unfortunately got coronavirus there, though she returned safe and well. I had to make it clear to the other four members of my team that if they had the slightest hint of symptoms, they weren’t to come in. This was difficult because I can only pay statutory sick pay, which isn’t enough to live on. I have a really supportive team so was relieved when they accepted this. At the end of March, I discussed the risks with my GP, who made it clear I was in a very difficult situation, where the factors that made me extremely vulnerable to coronavirus would also put me at low priority for critical care if services were overwhelmed, and that, if necessary, ventilators would be prioritised for people most likely to survive. I was left feeling devastated. I did as much research as I could around how to treat people with coronavirus. I did everything I could to set up intensive care-level treatment in my flat, for fear that I would catch it at a time when services were too overwhelmed to treat me. It was a terrifying and frenzied period. Some of my care workers fell ill with suspected coronavirus and I found my rota couldn’t manage if someone was off sick for three weeks. I requested that for every shift someone worked, they do another on call in order to ensure I had cover when people were off. This ate into people’s weeks and risked them overworking if others went off sick. As a result, I was without care for a number of hours on several occasions. It’s a really significant risk for me to be on my own. I struggled to get personal protective equipment (PPE) for my staff. I spoke to the council, which had very limited PPE. I was lucky that my girlfriend managed to source some. I made shifts 24-hours long instead of the usual 10-15 hours in order to minimise handover and potential exposure, and everyone had to change into clothes I provided on entering the flat. I really struggled. I felt resentful because after I was in hospital last year, I got out and had a short period of having a care plan that worked for me and let me live a normal life for the first time ever. Coronavirus hit and I was inside for three months. Now I feel as if I no longer know what’s safe. I don’t know if things are getting better. The world is opening up but when is the next wave of the virus coming? I’ve started going out late at night, since shielding ended. I’ve tried to develop a new normal but it’s really stressful. I’m terrified – if I catch Covid-19, will any of my care workers come in? They’ve all got people in their lives that they won’t want to infect. I honestly don’t know what I would do in their situation. I am so appreciative of my team. Some of them worked incredibly long shifts when another person called in sick. This pandemic has shown the absolute dedication of so many people who work in care but I feel let down by support services, the local authority and the government because of the lack of preparation, support, and information. There’s been a network of disabled people swapping tips and we all feel the same. There’s a lot of misinformation and panic going around. We’re not being given accurate and honest information, or the resources we need to protect ourselves. The media and wider society never talk about how many deaths of disabled people there have been from coronavirus. The disabled people’s movement has been highlighting for years about how care homes are used as a way of warehousing people until they die. This pandemic has underlined how afraid I am of being put in a care home – something I have been threatened with, due to the cost of my care package. In a care home I may not have survived this. In my own home, so far I’ve stayed safe.

        "text": "Figures emerge as Kindoki Witch Boy film tells true story of Mardoche Yembi who underwent an exorcism as a child Thousands of children in England have been accused of witchcraft over the past decade, according to new figures that come alongside a film released on Monday. Faith-based abuse is a worldwide phenomenon but experts found 14,000 social work assessments linked to witchcraft accusations since 2015. In the year running to March 2024 alone, there were 2,180 assessments linked to witchcraft. The statistics, compiled by the National FGM Centre, come as the film Kindoki Witch Boy is released, telling the story of Mardoche Yembi, 33, who was accused of witchcraft as a child growing up in north London and subjected to an exorcism. Its release date also marks the 25th anniversary of the death of Victoria Climbié, an eight-year-old girl who was tortured after accusations of witchcraft were levelled against her. Yembi hopes that the new film will encourage more of these children who are suffering behind closed doors to come forward. He said: “If a story like Kindoki Witch Boy had been out there when I was a child going through those experiences I would have felt less alone. I want this film to transform something that was bad into something good, to help other children going through the same thing. I hope children who are being accused will see that there is help out there and they can survive it.” Kindoki is one of several words used to describe the kind of witchcraft Yembi and Victoria were accused of along with terms sucha as djin, juju and voodoo. Victoria, who died on 25 February 2000, was brought to the UK by her great-aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao, offering Victoria’s parents a European education. But Victoria was killed, after suffering prolonged and extreme abuse, by Kouao and her partner Carl John Manning. They said she was possessed by evil spirits and she was exorcised by a pastor and forced to sleep in a bin bag in a freezing cold bathroom. At the time of her death, 128 separate injuries were found on her burned and malnourished body, in one of the most horrific cases of child abuse doctors had ever seen. She had come into contact with several health and social care services in the months before her killing. Manning and Kouao were jailed for her murder in 2001. Her death led to a child protection service overhaul. Yembi and Victoria were born just weeks apart and lived a few miles from each other in north London. Yembi was sent to the UK at the age of eight by his father from his home country of the Democratic Republic of the Congo after his mother died, to be looked after by relatives. Like many other children facing witchcraft accusations, Yembi was scapegoated for causing health and financial misfortunes in his relatives’ lives. Social services became concerned about him because his extended family said they wanted to send him back to DRC for an exorcism. Unlike Victoria, he did not experience physical abuse, but social services placed him with a foster mother who supported him for the next decade. He thrived in her care and now works to support young care leavers. The film, directed by Penny Woolcock, was shot over a period of nine days using a mix of professional and non-professional actors. Jeriah Kibusi plays Yembi and Fatmata B Jalloh plays herself as his foster mother. Yembi and Victoria never met, but he said that she had been very much in his mind while he had been working on the film. He said: “Part of this film is for her. She didn’t have a chance to make it. I want to keep her name alive.” Children accused of witchcraft can call Childline on 0800 1111 or NSPCC on 0808 800 500.",

        "text": "“It’s not common, its popular,” my father, John Smith, would say when asked about his name. For 35 years, John, who has died aged 83, was an ever-present feature of public life in Bury, Greater Manchester, variously serving as the mayor of the borough, deputy leader of the borough council and the council’s cabinet member for finance. But his passion was housing, as he had himself been the beneficiary of slum clearances in the early 1950s. He was the first chair of Six Town Housing, the arm’s-length management organisation for the council housing in stock, and in that role he gave tenants a real voice and pushed through the government’s Decent Homes Standard. Born in Jarrow, Co Durham (now South Tyneside), John was the sixth of the seven children of Elizabeth (nee Middleton), who worked in various part-time jobs, and James Smith, a carpenter and joiner at the local shipyards. Only five years before John’s birth, the Jarrow Crusade took place, when 200 men from the town marched to Westminster to protest about poverty and unemployment. John went to school in Jarrow and Sunderland before becoming the first member of his family to attend university. He graduated with a degree in chemistry from Manchester University in the late 1960s, and went on to teach chemistry at inner-city secondary schools, including Notre Dame and St Gregory’s in Manchester and St Anselm’s in Oldham. In 1969 John married Stella White, a biology teacher, and they made their home in Bury. There they brought up my three siblings, Stephen, Audrey and Helen, and me. John’s passion for social justice was there from the start, and his burgeoning interest in politics drew him towards the Labour party. He was elected to Bury council in 1990 in a byelection in the Elton ward, and was a committed Labour activist for the rest of his life, still chairing party meetings shortly before his death. He served as the mayor of Bury in 2002-03, supported by Stella, a fellow councillor, as his mayoress. They would go on to swap roles during her mayoral year in 2015-16. My father was a great encourager of talent, nurturing young activists into the often fraught world of Labour politics. These include Lisa Nandy and Jonathan Ashworth, and I followed in his footsteps as the deputy leader of Bury council. John was a generous and warm man who was widely liked and admired, with a wide circle of friends across politics and beyond. He was a longtime supporter of Newcastle United and loved rock’n’roll – he saw Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly and the Kinks live in concert, and Mum and Dad’s jive was second to none. In later years, after we children had left home, they enjoyed travelling, venturing as far as Australia, Thailand and China. John is survived by Stella, my siblings and me, and nine grandchildren, Georgia, Grace, Alfie, Joseph, Matilda, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Iris and Oliver.",

        "text": "Local authorities can collectively borrow £1.5bn to plug budget gaps caused by underfunding A record 30 English local authorities have been granted effective “bailouts” enabling them to borrow money to avoid bankruptcy, as ministers advised them against selling off prized local assets such as historic buildings, parks and allotments. The councils, all of whom were experiencing “unmanageable” financial pressures, were given the green light by ministers to collectively borrow £1.5bn to plug significant budget gaps caused by underfunding and soaring demand for social care and other services. Three councils – Birmingham, Bradford, and Windsor and Maidenhead – will each be allowed to borrow more than £100m this year to stay afloat, while also being allowed to issue cap-busting council tax bill increases of up to 10%. Six councils who are in special measures after declaring effective bankruptcy in recent years – Birmingham, Croydon, Nottingham, Slough, Thurrock and Woking – have again been granted special financial help. The exceptional financial support (EFS) packages enable councils to take out capital loans to fund revenue spending, on the basis they will pay down the debt in future by disposing of assets and cutting back on frontline services. For the first time, the government has imposed conditions preventing councils granted EFS help from selling what it calls “community and heritage assets”, reflecting fears that desperate councils could embark on a fire sale of well loved parks, golf courses, regeneration land and artworks. Councils granted special borrowing packages for the first time include Newham, Shropshire, Swindon, Trafford, West Berkshire, Wirral, Enfield, Halton, Barnet, Solihull, Worcestershire and Worthing. The number of London authorities receiving EFS jumped from two to seven, year-on-year. Claire Holland, the chair of London Councils umbrella group, said: “These figures show almost a quarter of town halls in London would face financial collapse without emergency borrowing.” Jim McMahon, the minister for local government, said: “We are under no illusion of the state of council finances and have been clear from the outset on our commitment to get councils back on their feet and rebuild the foundation of local government. “We are working with local leaders, encouraging councils to come in confidence where needed to seek help and be assured we will offer a relationship of partnership – not punishment – in our joint mission to improve public services for communities and create economic stability.” A statement from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said reform of council finances “would take time” and there was “potential for continued instability” in the months and years ahead. Hampshire county council, which applied for EFS support in the form of a 15% council tax rise for the next two years, had its bid rejected by ministers earlier this month. The 50% year-on-year increase in the number of EFS packages reflects rapidly deteriorating municipal balance sheets at councils all over England, in rural and urban areas, regardless of local political control. Upper-tier council balance sheets do not currently reflect soaring deficits in special educational needs spending, which are effectively kept off the books under special accounting rules due to come to an end in just over a year’s time. EFS support packages have proliferated since being introduced in 2021. Then, the tiny handful of EFS recipients had sought help after declaring effective bankruptcy as a result of risky property investments. Now most councils granted EFS are thought to be generally well-run victims of years of the structural underfunding that accompanied austerity, high inflation costs, as well as soaring demand for adult social care, child protection and homelessness services. The EFS approach goes against good accounting practice, and is seen by critics as a short-term fix that avoids effective insolvency by loading councils with debts. Many believe Labour’s ambition to tackle local government finance will fail without changes to council tax.",

        "text": "Exclusive: Charity says it has made drastic changes to safeguard future as Guardian finds it spent £100m more than it raised over last six years Macmillan Cancer Support has axed a quarter of its staff, downgraded its helpline and scrapped its flagship financial hardship scheme that provides millions of pounds in grants to thousands of patients, the Guardian can reveal. The UK’s most popular charity says a “tough financial climate” has led to it making drastic changes to safeguard its future and ensure it can still support the most vulnerable cancer patients. But a Guardian investigation raises questions over how Macmillan ended up in this position and how the closure of its 100-year-old hardship scheme will affect those patients most in need of support. The investigation found: 50,000 low-income cancer patients a year with less than £1,000 in savings will lose access to £200 hardship grants with the closure of the scheme. Macmillan has spent £100m more than it raised over the last six years. In 2023, spending on wages and salaries surged to £80m, up by almost one-fifth (18%) from £68m in just 12 months. In 2024, Macmillan told 1,200 staff – about 60% of its workforce – they were at risk of redundancy, with 431 leaving. Demand for Macmillan’s support and advice, as the UK’s top cancer support provider, is rapidly expanding. The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms, successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, and a growing and ageing population. Macmillan, created 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers, and providing specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year. The charity says the tough financial climate has forced it to make major cuts to its workforce and services to secure its “long-term financial sustainability”. In 2018, Macmillan’s board agreed to maintain spending on services despite flatlining income from donations. By regularly drawing on reserves over the next six years it was able to spend £100m more than it raised from the public and corporate sponsors. Although still one of the UK’s most successful fundraisers, by 2023 donations were failing to keep pace with rising costs and demand for cancer support. The last annual figures show its £232m income was dwarfed by £265m spending. Macmillan is also likely to face questions over its decision to axe its vital hardship grants scheme. It was introduced 100 years ago, when the charity – then the National Society for Cancer Relief – introduced handouts for medical fees, nursing care, clothing, artificial limbs and hot water bottles. The last annual figures show Macmillan distributed £17m via one-off £200 payments to low-income cancer patients to help them with transport costs for hospital visits or heating bills. The grants are means-tested – only households on very low incomes with savings of under £1,000 are eligible – and their value has shrunk in recent years from £350 to £200 as demand has soared. Macmillan says it will continue to support “the most vulnerable people with cancer” but has not specified how it will do so or who exactly would remain eligible for financial help in the future. The scheme is the UK’s only national cancer hardship fund, the Guardian found. Scrapping it will affect thousands of the country’s poorest cancer patients, at the same time as the UK experiences record levels of destitution and deep poverty. A breast cancer patient featured on Macmillan’s website, Laura, spoke of her “complete disbelief” when she was told she could get a £200 grant. “I cried so much but this time with happiness. I could pay my rent this month and be able to buy some oil for heating.” A second patient, Linda, diagnosed with breast and kidney cancer, said the grant enabled her to keep the heating on as she recovered from surgery. “Though I was signed off work on sick pay, it wasn’t enough to cover the higher costs of heating my home, so the grant really did make a difference.” Cuts to Macmillan’s helpline teams will see fewer phone operators and reductions in the level of specialist financial advice and emotional support they can give to callers. Macmillan said that like many charities, it had felt the impact of the financial climate and had made changes to help refocus its resources, and to secure its long-term financial sustainability. The charity confirmed it had put 1,262 people at risk of redundancy, of whom 239 took voluntary redundancy and 174 were made redundant. A spokesperson said: “We had to make some very difficult decisions including reducing the size of our organisation by 26%.” Macmillan’s aim was to support more cancer patients, the spokesperson added. “To do that with less money and a smaller team, we must focus on developing the services which we can scale up to meet growing need. We’ve reviewed all of our services, including the grants we offer where demand far outweighs the funds we have, and made the difficult decision to close this offer.” The spokesperson added: “Throughout, we have tried to minimise disruption for people with cancer.” Macmillan was now in a “strong financial position to continue to offer vital support to people with cancer into the future”.",

Her belief in standing up for what was right inspired me to enter local politics. From 2008 to 2018 she raised tens of thousands pounds for charities and her local church, running a charity stall in Pontypool market, south Wales, with her friend Ceinwen Parker. She played a large part in all my favourite childhood memories. A whirlwind of grit and generosity, she conjured magic from elderflowers, blackberries and fabric scraps. Her home was a sanctuary, where roast lamb dinners and milky tea were constantly served. Hazel was born on a smallholding in Cwmavon, near Abersychan, Torfaen, to Bertha (nee Williams) and William John Gulliford, a poultryman who travelled all over the eastern south Wales valleys to kill pigs and poultry for farmers. At 14, after Victoria Village school, she began working at the canteen in Tirpentwys colliery, walking miles each day to serve miners. There, she met a dashing soldier, Thomas Jenkins; they married in 1949, when she was in her late teens. She raised eight children over 13 years. Her story is emblematic of the working-class women of her era, whose labour, both seen and unseen, underpinned family and community life. Hazel endured personal losses with dignity, including the deaths of her husband, a grandson and a daughter. Her mantra “never explain, never complain” reflected a life of quiet strength. Although she lived her whole life in Victoria Village, my grandmother’s adventures extended way beyond the family home. Later in life, she travelled widely and I loved hearing her tales of Israel, north Africa and New York. She had a wonderful sense of humour and mischief. A devoted admirer of Diana, Princess of Wales, at a Buckingham Palace garden party in 2013 she voiced her opinions about a particular royal a little too loudly, leaving me scrambling to avoid a diplomatic incident. Thomas died in 1998. Hazel is survived by seven children, Lynette, Marilyn, Julie, Karen, John, Mervyn and Gwyn, 23 grandchildren, and three half-siblings, Anthea, Ron, and Adrian.",

        "text": "‘We’re not going to fund failure,’ says governor, who warned local authorities they could lose out on millions of dollars California’s governor warned cities and counties that they could lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in state funding if they do not make progress in clearing out encampments and tackling homelessness. Gavin Newsom’s comments on Monday, while announcing $920m in funding to address the crisis, come as he escalates efforts to push local governments to take greater action. Last summer, Newsom told counties he could withhold state support if they failed to do more homeless encampment sweeps. “We want to see results. We have to address unsheltered homelessness, encampments and tents,” Newsom said. “We have been too permissive … we need them cleaned up. We’re providing unprecedented support, now we need to see unprecedented results. “If we don’t, we’re not going to continue to fund excuses, [we’re] not going to continue to fund failure.” California’s homelessness crisis is the worst in the US with roughly one-third of the country’s population of unhoused people, which experts attribute to a lack of affordable housing in the state. A 2023 count found that more than 180,000 people in the state were experiencing homelessness, including 123,000 people who were unsheltered or living outside on the streets in tents, trailers, cars and makeshift shelters. Cities in California and across the US have begun cracking down on homelessness with harsher anti-camping policies following the US supreme court’s ruling last year that cities can criminalize unhoused people for sleeping outside – even when there are no shelter spaces available. Over the summer Newsom issued an executive order calling for the removal of encampments on state property. This month the Bay Area city of Fremont passed a controversial law banning camping on public property and making “permitting, aiding, [or] abetting” encampments illegal. Advocates for unhoused people have warned that such policies only worsen the crisis and make it harder for people to access services. Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Newsom’s announcement on Monday of the $920m in newly available funds came with stricter “accountability measures” for local governments and an online tool allowing residents to track progress in their communities. The money includes $760m in new funding, as well as roughly $160m in grants for local governments. This year’s funds come with significantly more strings attached, Newsom said, and governments are expected to aggressively focus on clearing encampments, as well as creating new shelter. The governor has proposed a clawback provision that will allow the state to take back funding from local governments that “fail to demonstrate progress”. “People want to see their sidewalks taken back. They want their streets safe again. They want to bring their kids, walk them down the streets to the playground without stepping over people on the sidewalks,” Newsom said. State funding could take on even greater importance during the Trump administration. Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” has targeted the Office of Community Planning and Development, which funds housing and support for unhoused people, for significant cuts. The department is expected to lose 84% of its staff, according to an NPR report.",

        "text": "Charities across the country highlight the rising demand for emergency accommodation as costs spiral to care for those most in need Holly Udobang is packing the last bag: a sleeping mat, gloves, woolly hat, waterproof poncho, hand warmers. It’s the sort of kit that teenagers might need for a Duke of Edinburgh trip. But this bag is for young homeless people, to give them a fighting chance of getting some sleep on the streets of London. Holly and her colleagues at the New Horizon Youth Centre are packing them to give to the young people they now have to turn away every day, as an increasing number of emergency shelters shut their doors. “Things are going backwards,” says Phil Kerry, New Horizon’s chief executive. “People come to the centre and we’re not able to help them that day and they’re going out on to the streets. That’s a daily reality. There are simply not enough places for people to go, even in the winter.” This is the last kit bag because the 199 others that New Horizon bought for the winter have already been handed out, six weeks earlier than expected. The number of rough sleepers in London had risen from 3,107 in March 2023 to 4,612 by December last year, according to data from Chain, the homelessness information network. More than a third are under 35, meaning they are over-represented compared with the population average of 27% of adults in England and Wales. New Horizon’s experience is echoed by charities around the country. Roundabout in Sheffield began running hostel accommodation in Sheffield 10 years ago and last year ran out of space for the first time, putting about 15 people in hotels instead, a number that has tripled this year. In Manchester, Depaul UK supports young people at risk of homelessness, trying to prevent them from sleeping rough. By May last year, a third of those coming for help were sleeping rough and that rose to 60% by December, according to Nicola Harwood, Depaul’s executive director of operations. New Horizon runs a drop-in centre at King’s Cross, central London, offering help to find housing and work, as well as food and a place to have a shower, do laundry and get warm. There are broadly four kinds of people needing help, staff say, although a common factor is family breakdown brought on by the cost of living crisis. “Some of them have quite severe mental heath needs,” says Udobang, who is New Horizon’s counsellor. “Some have been kicked out of their family home because of their sexuality. We get a lot of people escaping gangs. And we get a lot of people from Home Office accommodation.” Homelessness among refugees doubled last year. On 9 December, the Home Office extended the number of days asylum seekers can stay in government accommodation before finding their own (to 56 days), but by then charities said they were already facing an emergency. The rising demand has been compounded by shrinking numbers of “supported exempt accommodation” projects, intended for people with extra needs, such as care leavers or domestic abuse survivors, and for which the amount of housing benefit is uncapped. Sign up to Observed Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion Horizon could count on 29 of these short-term accommodation providers in London last year, but just 15 are left. The sector has been exploited by criminals and landlords providing substandard housing. In 2023, MPs passed the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Act to tackle the problem and local authorities have been less prepared to sanction them. The charity can afford to put some people in hotels for up to seven days but costs are spiralling. “In my first year at the centre, in 2018, I think we spent about £30,000 on emergency accommodation,” Kerry says. “Last year, it was over £100,000. This year, I don’t know where we’re going to end up but we spent £50,000 in the last three months.” Young people looking for housing face what Kerry calls “triple discrimination”. Under-35s receive less housing benefit due to their age, under-25s get less universal credit, and under-21s have a lower minimum wage. Social housing is in short supply and private rents are too high – Kerry says just one room out of more than 2,000 on Spareroom.com in Camden, north London, would be affordable on the reduced benefits available to young people. The only remaining option is supported exempt accommodation. “Having to make referrals through these supported providers was really the only option we could use for young people,” says Neil Parkinson, co-head of casework at Glass Door, a homeless charity in London that runs a night shelter. “A lot of homeless people do have additional needs but having to evidence that [can be hard].” In the middle of this month, MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee warned ministers that England faced a rough sleeping emergency, which its chair, Florence Eshalomi MP, described as “a source of national shame”. She added: “The success of the Everyone In policy during the pandemic shows it’s possible to end rough sleeping.” Angela Rayner is leading an inter-ministerial group on tackling homelessness and rough sleeping and in December allocated nearly £1bn on homelessness spending, including £37m for a rough sleeping accommodation programme.",

        "text": "By Ashley Brown , Juana Summers , Matt Ozug Kayaks were once essential to Greenland's Inuit population, who used them for hunting. Now, the kayak is a symbol of national identity. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Kayaks are a key part of Greenland's history. The Inuit people of the island use them to hunt for food. And today, the kayak is a symbol of Greenlandic identity. Our co-host Juana Sommers met some of the people carrying on the tradition in Greenland's capital.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  I'm standing at the edge of a swimming pool as members of Nuuk's kayak club paddle their kayaks across the water. They come here when it's too cold to practice outside. Greenland kayakers are known for rolling.They're literally capsizing the kayak with their own strength and having to use the torque of their bodies and the paddle to right themselves fairly quickly.Those rolls and their more than two dozen techniques are part of what makes Greenlandic kayaking unique. I watch them practice for a while, and then it's my turn for a more basic lesson.Let's do it.PAVIA TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) The Greenland kayak is unique. Plastic kayaks are usually wider and heavier, making them slower in water. Also when we build it ourselves, we can customize the shape and size to our own preferences.SUMMERS: This is Pavia Tobiassen. He heads up the kayak club, and he's helping me get situated.I've never been in a kayak before, never.TOBIASSEN: OK.SUMMERS: I promise to pay attention. Take this? My legs go forward? All right, we're learning stuff.I take a seat in a practice kayak. Tobiassen hands me a paddle. It doesn't look like the type of kayak paddle I've seen before. This one is slim and narrow. The blades aren't very wide at all.So I'm holding the paddle about shoulder width, distance apart.TOBIASSEN: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Relax your body? You know, new skills. I'm going to try my best. All right, Pavia's hopping in the pool to help me out a little bit.He takes off his shirt and helps me push off. I noticed that he has a tattoo that says, America, on his chest. When I ask him about it, he chalks it up to an impulsive teenage decision.We're taking a little lap around the pool here. Trying to keep this kayak straight - varying degrees of success.SUMMERS: I make my way around the pool really slowly, and somehow, I don't tip over.All right, we've made it back to the dock. Thank you for dragging me back in. How did I do?TOBIASSEN: Good.SUMMERS: Good? All right, I got a thumbs up. That's better than I expected (laughter).Greenland today is caught in a tug of war between competing international tensions. They believe in tradition. They don't want to be Danish? They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life. And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago.

It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Kayaks are a key part of Greenland's history. The Inuit people of the island use them to hunt for food. And today, the kayak is a symbol of Greenlandic identity. Our co-host Juana Sommers met some of the people carrying on the tradition in Greenland's capital.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  I'm standing at the edge of a swimming pool as members of Nuuk's kayak club paddle their kayaks across the water. They come here when it's too cold to practice outside. Greenland kayakers are known for rolling.They're literally capsizing the kayak with their own strength and having to use the torque of their bodies and the paddle to right themselves fairly quickly.Those rolls and their more than two dozen techniques are part of what makes Greenlandic kayaking unique. I watch them practice for a while, and then it's my turn for a more basic lesson.Let's do it.PAVIA TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) The Greenland kayak is unique. Plastic kayaks are usually wider and heavier, making them slower in water. Also when we build it ourselves, we can customize the shape and size to our own preferences.SUMMERS: This is Pavia Tobiassen. He heads up the kayak club, and he's helping me get situated.I've never been in a kayak before, never.TOBIASSEN: OK.SUMMERS: I promise to pay attention. Take this? My legs go forward? All right, we're learning stuff.I take a seat in a practice kayak. Tobiassen hands me a paddle. It doesn't look like the type of kayak paddle I've seen before. This one is slim and narrow. The blades aren't very wide at all.So I'm holding the paddle about shoulder width, distance apart.TOBIASSEN: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Relax your body? You know, new skills. I'm going to try my best. All right, Pavia's hopping in the pool to help me out a little bit.He takes off his shirt and helps me push off. I noticed that he has a tattoo that says, America, on his chest. When I ask him about it, he chalks it up to an impulsive teenage decision.We're taking a little lap around the pool here. Trying to keep this kayak straight - varying degrees of success.SUMMERS: I make my way around the pool really slowly, and somehow, I don't tip over.All right, we've made it back to the dock. Thank you for dragging me back in. How did I do?TOBIASSEN: Good.SUMMERS: Good? All right, I got a thumbs up. That's better than I expected (laughter).Greenland today is caught in a tug of war between competing international tensions. They believe in tradition. They don't want to be Danish? They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life. And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that.

I'm standing at the edge of a swimming pool as members of Nuuk's kayak club paddle their kayaks across the water. They come here when it's too cold to practice outside. Greenland kayakers are known for rolling.They're literally capsizing the kayak with their own strength and having to use the torque of their bodies and the paddle to right themselves fairly quickly.Those rolls and their more than two dozen techniques are part of what makes Greenlandic kayaking unique. I watch them practice for a while, and then it's my turn for a more basic lesson.Let's do it.PAVIA TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) The Greenland kayak is unique. Plastic kayaks are usually wider and heavier, making them slower in water. Also when we build it ourselves, we can customize the shape and size to our own preferences.SUMMERS: This is Pavia Tobiassen. He heads up the kayak club, and he's helping me get situated.I've never been in a kayak before, never.TOBIASSEN: OK.SUMMERS: I promise to pay attention. Take this? My legs go forward? All right, we're learning stuff.I take a seat in a practice kayak. Tobiassen hands me a paddle. It doesn't look like the type of kayak paddle I've seen before. This one is slim and narrow. The blades aren't very wide at all.So I'm holding the paddle about shoulder width, distance apart.TOBIASSEN: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Relax your body? You know, new skills. I'm going to try my best. All right, Pavia's hopping in the pool to help me out a little bit.He takes off his shirt and helps me push off. I noticed that he has a tattoo that says, America, on his chest. When I ask him about it, he chalks it up to an impulsive teenage decision.We're taking a little lap around the pool here. Trying to keep this kayak straight - varying degrees of success.SUMMERS: I make my way around the pool really slowly, and somehow, I don't tip over.All right, we've made it back to the dock. Thank you for dragging me back in. How did I do?TOBIASSEN: Good.SUMMERS: Good? All right, I got a thumbs up. That's better than I expected (laughter).Greenland today is caught in a tug of war between competing international tensions. They believe in tradition. They don't want to be Danish? They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life. And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that. It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph). He's been building kayaks for three years.KOLUK JENSEN POLSON: I like creating kayaks because I can style it myself, so I know it can be better for me when I compete.SUMMERS: How did you get started building kayaks?POLSON: My dad used to build me kayak, and he was in cancer.SUMMERS: His dad was diagnosed with cancer, so he picked up the work. I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies. Naia Roke Peterson (ph) sits at a desk nearby. She says it's good that kayaks are used for sport now but that it's important to remember the ways that her ancestors used them.NAIA ROKE PETERSON: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Without kayaks, there would be no food she tells me.

And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that. It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph). He's been building kayaks for three years.KOLUK JENSEN POLSON: I like creating kayaks because I can style it myself, so I know it can be better for me when I compete.SUMMERS: How did you get started building kayaks?POLSON: My dad used to build me kayak, and he was in cancer.SUMMERS: His dad was diagnosed with cancer, so he picked up the work. I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies. Naia Roke Peterson (ph) sits at a desk nearby. She says it's good that kayaks are used for sport now but that it's important to remember the ways that her ancestors used them.NAIA ROKE PETERSON: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Without kayaks, there would be no food she tells me.

Let's do it.PAVIA TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) The Greenland kayak is unique. Plastic kayaks are usually wider and heavier, making them slower in water. Also when we build it ourselves, we can customize the shape and size to our own preferences.SUMMERS: This is Pavia Tobiassen. He heads up the kayak club, and he's helping me get situated.I've never been in a kayak before, never.TOBIASSEN: OK.SUMMERS: I promise to pay attention. Take this? My legs go forward? All right, we're learning stuff.I take a seat in a practice kayak. Tobiassen hands me a paddle. It doesn't look like the type of kayak paddle I've seen before. This one is slim and narrow. The blades aren't very wide at all.So I'm holding the paddle about shoulder width, distance apart.TOBIASSEN: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Relax your body? You know, new skills. I'm going to try my best. All right, Pavia's hopping in the pool to help me out a little bit.He takes off his shirt and helps me push off.

Trying to keep this kayak straight - varying degrees of success.SUMMERS: I make my way around the pool really slowly, and somehow, I don't tip over.All right, we've made it back to the dock.

They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s.

And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that. It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph). He's been building kayaks for three years.KOLUK JENSEN POLSON: I like creating kayaks because I can style it myself, so I know it can be better for me when I compete.SUMMERS: How did you get started building kayaks?POLSON: My dad used to build me kayak, and he was in cancer.SUMMERS: His dad was diagnosed with cancer, so he picked up the work. I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies. Naia Roke Peterson (ph) sits at a desk nearby. She says it's good that kayaks are used for sport now but that it's important to remember the ways that her ancestors used them.NAIA ROKE PETERSON: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Without kayaks, there would be no food she tells me.

Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies. Naia Roke Peterson (ph) sits at a desk nearby. She says it's good that kayaks are used for sport now but that it's important to remember the ways that her ancestors used them.NAIA ROKE PETERSON: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Without kayaks, there would be no food she tells me.

I take a seat in a practice kayak. Tobiassen hands me a paddle. It doesn't look like the type of kayak paddle I've seen before. This one is slim and narrow. The blades aren't very wide at all.So I'm holding the paddle about shoulder width, distance apart.TOBIASSEN: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Relax your body? You know, new skills. I'm going to try my best. All right, Pavia's hopping in the pool to help me out a little bit.He takes off his shirt and helps me push off. I noticed that he has a tattoo that says, America, on his chest. When I ask him about it, he chalks it up to an impulsive teenage decision.We're taking a little lap around the pool here. Trying to keep this kayak straight - varying degrees of success.SUMMERS: I make my way around the pool really slowly, and somehow, I don't tip over.All right, we've made it back to the dock. Thank you for dragging me back in. How did I do?TOBIASSEN: Good.SUMMERS: Good? All right, I got a thumbs up. That's better than I expected (laughter).Greenland today is caught in a tug of war between competing international tensions. They believe in tradition. They don't want to be Danish? They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life. And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that. It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph).

It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph). He's been building kayaks for three years.KOLUK JENSEN POLSON: I like creating kayaks because I can style it myself, so I know it can be better for me when I compete.SUMMERS: How did you get started building kayaks?POLSON: My dad used to build me kayak, and he was in cancer.SUMMERS: His dad was diagnosed with cancer, so he picked up the work. I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies.

That's better than I expected (laughter).Greenland today is caught in a tug of war between competing international tensions. They believe in tradition. They don't want to be Danish? They don't want to be American. They're Greenlandic. Keeping this part of their heritage alive is one way they're showing the world who they are.TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life.

It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside.

It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph).

I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland.

TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) What's most important is that we, as Greenlandic kayakers, are continuing a tradition that has been a part of our way of life for generations.SUMMERS: Pavia Tobiassen started kayaking in the 1990s. And when he started, he says there were barely any kayakers in Nuuk.How do you feel when you kayak? What does it make you feel?TOBIASSEN: (Through interpreter) I can see seals, whales, and birds up close as they move along. Of course, when I think back to how our ancestors lived, I can really feel the deep connection to their way of life. And that adds to the feeling of freedom I experience.SUMMERS: To learn more about the ancestral heritage of paddling and building kayaks in Greenland, we headed to the kayak clubhouse. It's a small wooden building that overlooks the water, a rack of kayaks stacked up outside. A man is using a small knife, scraping away at what looks like a long string.Tell us about what he's cutting there. What is it?IDA NIELSEN: It's a seal skin that - he's helping me take off the hairs because we need to make, like, a rope, like a string almost. Goes on the outside of the kayak.(SOUNDBITE OF KNIFE SCRAPING)NIELSEN: My name is Ida Nielsen, and I am trying to build some kayaks here.SUMMERS: Ida Nielsen moved to Greenland from Denmark four years ago. Members of the club are here building their own kayaks.NIELSEN: You can put your - like, your tools or your paddle or your (non-English language spoken). There's not really an American word for that. It's, like, the thing you use to throw your harpoon.SUMMERS: The building's small with low ceilings. There are kayaks, paddles and long wooden harpoons hanging over our heads. All of these kayaks are made from traditional designs and materials, like seal skin, whale bone and reindeer antlers. There are two men sawing part of a kayak frame as we start talking to 18-year-old Koluk Jensen Polson (ph). He's been building kayaks for three years.KOLUK JENSEN POLSON: I like creating kayaks because I can style it myself, so I know it can be better for me when I compete.SUMMERS: How did you get started building kayaks?POLSON: My dad used to build me kayak, and he was in cancer.SUMMERS: His dad was diagnosed with cancer, so he picked up the work. I ask him to show me his kayak. Today, he's working on finishing the wooden ribs of the frame.POLSON: We steam it and let it steam in water and steam it and bend it.SUMMERS: Bend it so it makes the shape of the kayak that...POLSON: Yeah.SUMMERS: ...We're used to, that rounded shape at the bottom?POLSON: Mm-hmm.SUMMERS: Today, kayaking is an incredibly popular sport in Greenland. There is a national championship every year that draws kayakers from across Greenland and around the world. At the Nuuk kayak club, one shelf is full of trophies. Naia Roke Peterson (ph) sits at a desk nearby. She says it's good that kayaks are used for sport now but that it's important to remember the ways that her ancestors used them.NAIA ROKE PETERSON: (Non-English language spoken).SUMMERS: Without kayaks, there would be no food she tells me.

Covington has been performing at Aretha's Jazz Café and other venues across the city for over 20 years and recently gained a residency at the cafe and produces a Preservation of Jazz Monday night music series called \"Tributes\" honoring jazz icons. \"We're a part of a movement here in Detroit and part of the Black history in Detroit,\" Covington said. \"It makes me feel proud and it inspires me to want to do better for the community.\" Lady Vonne (left) and Veronique Musique apply their makeup in a dressing room before performing as Phyllis Hyman and Nancy Wilson on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Jarrus/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lucretia Sain prepares her headpiece in a dressing room before opening the show Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Jarrus/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Backstage in the dressing room, laughter and conversation flowed as singers applied eyeliner, adjusted wigs, chatted about their children and grandchildren, and exchanged words of encouragement while helping each other zip into their dresses before the show.

I call it the first American music. It's my heritage,\" Davis said. \"And I would like to pass it onto the other generations and let them know, keep this alive. Because you cannot kill the roots.\" Lady Vonne, a native Detroiter and well-known jazz singer in the city, honored the late Phyllis Hyman through her enchanting, timeless vocals with emotional renditions of \"Why Not Me\" and \"Living All Alone\" that elicited a standing ovation.

        "text": "By Glen Weldon , Aisha Harris , Linda Holmes , Stephen Thompson A scene from the Oscar-nominated animated film Flow.\n\n                    \n                    Janus Films\n                    \n                \nhide caption This week, the Screen Actors Guild Awards surprised us, further complicating an already complicated Oscar race. And we lost both a great actor and a beloved singer. Here's what NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour crew was paying attention to — and what you should check out this weekend. Flow is one of the films nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar this year. It's also up for Best International Feature Film, and it's the first Latvian film to be nominated for any Academy Awards. You can watch it on Max. There are no subtitles because there is no dialogue. It's about a cat who survives a flood that seems to cover most of the Earth who is forced to reject all their catlike intuition and actually work with others. There's a capybara and a lemur and the dumbest, doofiest, most obnoxiously cheerful golden retriever that they have to work with. So much work has been done to not anthropomorphize these animals. All their actions and reactions are kept as realistic as possible. Cat people are going to watch this and think, \"Yes, that's exactly what my cat would do.\" And dog people like me are going to watch it and think, \"Yes, that is just what my dumb jock of a dog would do.\" It's great. — Glen Weldon In the last few weeks, I've spent a lot of time listening to Pete Seeger. In the album We Shall Overcome, he performs a handful of Bob Dylan songs. It was recorded within a week or two of when The Freewheelin Bob Dylan came out. Anything you can find of Pete Seeger or the Weavers, which is the group that he sang with for a really long time, will be both happy making and really stirring. A lot of it is about difficult times and times of trial and I recommend it most highly. — Linda Holmes Deal or No Deal Island is airing on NBC, streaming on Peacock. Maybe you saw the phrase \"Deal or No Deal Island\" on your TV schedule and thought \"the Howie Mandel thing with the suitcases on an island?\" then never thought of it again. The show is basically a mash up of about six different shows, including Deal or No Deal. They still do the thing with the suitcases at the end of each episode, but the purpose is different. There are also elements of Survivor, The Challenge, Big Brother and other shows with alliances, hurt feelings and splashing in the mud. It's held together by Joe Manganiello of Magic Mike fame who was born to do this. It's a lot of fun to watch if you like these competition shows. It may just be the palate cleanser that you need this Oscars weekend. — Stephen Thompson Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius) is a documentary about the legendary Sly Stone directed by Questlove, streaming on Hulu. Now, is this Questlove's Oscar winning debut Summer of Soul? No, that's a tough act to follow. This is a movie that's about Stone's groundbreaking artistry and how that artistry has been historically undervalued. The documentary has interviews with people like Chaka Khan, Q-Tip and D'Angelo. We get a lot of great moments and soundbites from those folks, but I think the best thing about this is when the talking heads get super, super nerdy about the music itself. There's some great sequences where you have Nile Rodgers, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis breaking down the instrumentation and the vocals on songs like \"Dance to the Music,\" and it's just a real delight. — Aisha Harris by Glen Weldon Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna stop reading this page, click on this link and watch comedian Matteo Lane walk you through an old clip of Liza Minelli on the Home Shopping Network. You will notice how thoroughly Lane has imprinted every second of this clip – every breath, every nuance, every movement, everything – onto his very soul. Then you're gonna come back here and thank me for making your life better for 11 minutes and 25 seconds. Now you're gonna stop reading this page again, click on this link, and play the browser-based game Dragonsweeper, which maps fantasy-RPG elements onto Minesweeper.

        "title": "Rodrigo Prieto’s Risky Directorial Début | The New Yorker",
        "text": "In a darkened room in the Warner Bros. studio in Hell’s Kitchen, Rodrigo Prieto sat on the edge of his chair, with a notepad in hand. He was fine-tuning the latest cut of his film, “Pedro Páramo,” an adaptation of a mysterious Mexican novel that has fascinated and baffled generations of readers. After decades as one of Hollywood’s best-regarded cinematographers, Prieto was making his directorial début. In a gentle voice, Prieto asked to pause the film. The screen filled with a shot of two characters holding an oil lamp as they wander a desolate Mexican town in the middle of the night. It was a quiet scene, but a source of obsession for Prieto. Key passages in the novel unfold at night, so the first question that he had wrestled with was how to mimic the moon. “Moonlight can’t be trusted,” he said wryly. In real life, moonlight spreads as far as the eye can see; the challenge for Prieto was to recreate its expansiveness while also finding a balance between darkness and light. “You want to see the emotion in the actors and yet feel that it’s dark,” he said. “That’s moonlight.” In the past, Prieto had achieved the effect that he wanted by bouncing light off weather balloons suspended from trees. Here, he was constrained by the location, a seventeenth-century village with cobblestoned streets. So he designed a sprawling structure that extended over every house in the frame—a metal scaffold hung with more than a hundred light tubes, the distance between them measured to the millimetre. The crew likened it to a spine winding through the streets. In the studio, Prieto, dressed in a white guayabera and jeans, surveyed the image. The effect was just as he had envisioned it: an evenly abundant light, which seemed to glow from the sky. He took one last look, then flipped the page on his notepad. As Prieto fussed over details, everyone was conscious of a larger concern. The film’s première was just a few weeks away, and the response was impossible to predict. Prieto has worked with a succession of prominent directors, including Martin Scorsese, Ang Lee, and Greta Gerwig, creating the visual world of movies as distinct as “Barbie” and “Eight Mile.” But, for his first film as a director, he’d picked a singularly difficult project. The novel, by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo, is an epic of the years around the country’s revolution. Set in the fictional town of Comala, it follows a young man named Juan Preciado as he searches for his estranged father, a brutal overlord named Pedro Páramo. It is not long—more a novella than a novel—but it is wildly ambitious: a consideration of nation-building, oppression, and familial trauma, written in an elliptical, allusive style that critics have referred to as realismo fantasmal, or ghostly realism. In many passages, it is not clear where in time the action takes place, or whether the characters are alive or dead. When Rulfo published “Pedro Páramo,” in 1955, he had to give away free copies to entice people to read it. Eventually, the novel found a following, including Gabriel García Márquez, who was introduced to “Pedro Páramo” during a torturous period of writer’s block. “Read this, dammit, so you can learn,” a friend had told him. Transfixed, García Márquez memorized its pages and got to work on “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Rulfo’s work became a staple of Mexican classrooms, a book that every serious student had to read. Yet many filmmakers believed that it was impossible to bring to the screen: the language was too intricate, the narrative too circuitous. Three attempts, in the sixties, seventies, and eighties, had resulted in bracing disappointments. The German director Werner Herzog entertained the idea, then finally told himself, “Don’t touch it.” Juan Carlos Rulfo, the author’s son, wondered if the reverence for his father was doing a disservice to his legacy, saying that whoever undertook this project had to “overcome their fear of the work.” In 2021, forty years after the last adaptation of “Pedro Páramo,” Netflix approached Prieto, who was then working on Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Prieto knew the book, and recognized the challenges that it posed. But, he recalled, “I didn’t want that to stop me. Perhaps irresponsibly, I said yes.” On a spring afternoon in 1999, Prieto was bent over a trash can in Mexico City, rushing to put a camera in place. He was directing the photography of Alejandro González Iñárritu’s first feature, “Amores Perros,” and the opening scene was about to roll. Nine cameras would film the sequence: a violent car crash in a busy intersection, where the film’s multiple story lines converge. Prieto and Iñárritu had mapped each shot, then devoted hours to figuring out the exact time and speed at which the two cars would collide. But, in the middle of dress rehearsal, one of the bumpers had fallen off. As technicians worked to repair it, a crowd of onlookers was growing, and the production was running out of time. With a bare-bones budget, it was impossible to return the following day. They had a single chance to get it right. Prieto was obsessing over the light, which was waning quickly as evening approached. Even subtle changes required manual adjustments to the cameras, which were scattered all over: inside vehicles, behind street signs, hung over roofs. When, at last, the car’s bumper was fixed, everyone was ordered to clear the frame. Prieto ran back to operate a 35-mm. reflex from behind a restaurant window. As Iñárritu was getting ready to yell “Acción,” a cabdriver pulled into the street, mere feet from the shot. Crew members yelled at him to move, but the driver, determined to park, simply turned off his engine and walked away. Minutes later, filming began. The cars involved in the crash, a Grand Marquis and a remote-controlled Nissan Sentra, started rolling, and within seconds they reached the intersection. As the two vehicles collided, there was a loud boom; their windshields shattered, and the scene was engulfed in smoke. The Grand Marquis instantly caught fire. The Sentra caromed into the taxi, climbed up its hood, and came to rest. The crew rushed to put out the flames, and when the stuntman emerged uninjured everyone lunged to hug him. The insurance would take care of the cabdriver’s bill later; “Amores Perros” now had an opening scene. Prieto had met Iñárritu six years before, when, as a young cinematographer, he got a call from Z Films, a production company that Iñárritu had helped found. Prieto knew him from his time as a d.j. at Mexico City’s most popular rock-and-roll station—a subversive, inventive presence on the air. They hit it off right away, as Iñárritu was drawn to Prieto’s technical skill and his easy manner. Z Films made much of its money with a series of breezy, entertaining commercials. But Prieto and Iñárritu were restless. They wanted to make movies—ones that would push against the constraints of the Mexican film industry. At the time, powerful unions dictated who could work in the business. “It was practically illegal to make a movie outside of the unions,” Prieto told me. “Someone had to die or retire for the rest of us to work our way up the ladder.” The films, made by a small group of directors, largely revolved around familiar tropes: tales of forbidden love, bawdy comedies, and border thrillers. Aside from school, the only place for young filmmakers to encounter new ideas was the Cineteca Nacional, a monumental theatre complex in Mexico City. “We were watching foreign movies and aspiring to do things differently,” Prieto said. “The techniques and ways of doing photography in Mexico were stuck in the sixties.” In 1998, Iñárritu told Prieto that he had a film project in its early stages: “Perro Negro, Perro Blanco.” The script, written by Guillermo Arriaga, had gone through thirty-six revisions, and Iñárritu was finally ready to show it. “It was an enormous surprise,” Prieto said. The text, partly inspired by “The Sound and the Fury,” traced the stories of a lustful model, a homeless man, and a fiery young couple; it was both a critique of class and a portrait of a city defined by startling beauty and violence. When Iñárritu invited Prieto over to talk about the film, Prieto unzipped his bag and took out a book: “I’ll Be Your Mirror,” a collection of raw, gritty images by the American photographer Nan Goldin. Iñárritu smiled; he had set the same book aside for Prieto. The two decided to use handheld cameras, an unusual technique in Mexico at the time, to make the film feel viscerally realistic. They distinguished the interwoven story lines by assigning each one its own kind of film. But Mexico City proved particularly hard to capture. Smog tinged the images gray, rendering the city colorless. Prieto wanted to bring the capital to life, as Wong Kar-wai had done for Hong Kong in “Chungking Express.” He experimented with techniques until he landed on bleach bypass, which skips a step of bleaching in processing the film. Among filmmakers, it was seen as a potentially destructive maneuver—the silver left on the negative could damage it over time. But Iñárritu and Prieto were willing to take the risk. If you were lucky enough to make a movie in Mexico, it could very well be your last, so why hew to convention? As the movie went into final editing, no one could tell how it would be received in Mexico, much less abroad. Gael García Bernal, one of the lead actors, asked Iñárritu for a VHS copy, in case it never reached the big screen. Prieto had decided to move to Los Angeles. At thirty-three, he was burned-out on making commercials for a living and wanted to commit to a career in film. On the day that “Amores Perros” had its première, at the Cannes Critics’ Week, Prieto was at the D.M.V. in Hollywood. His phone rang, and when he flipped it open he heard Iñárritu yelling, “Cabrón! We won!” Prieto gasped, then started shouting with joy. “Sir, sir, quiet it down,” a clerk said, before finally asking him to leave. “Amores Perros” was a hit in Mexico, grossed a total of twenty million dollars, and became the first movie to represent Mexico at the Oscars in more than two decades. Critics described it as an evolutionary leap—an emblem of what became known as the New Mexican Cinema. Soon after its release, American directors started calling Prieto. They wanted to know how he had made it look the way it did. Greta Gerwig, who hired Prieto to create the visual landscape of “Barbie,” described him as “an artist who is always focussed on the story that he’s telling above all else.” The two spent months together at a Warner Bros. studio outside London, working to bring Barbie Land to life. Gerwig hoped to convey a sense of “authentic artificiality,” which resonated with Prieto; his job is to deploy layers of artifice to make an image look real. He suggested shooting digitally, to produce a flawless, almost texture-less image. There would be no obtuse angles; the idea was to maintain a feeling of innocence, like that of a child opening a toy for the first time. Prieto believes that every shot is autobiographical: his visual language derives from his memory of light. “I am always observing its behavior,” he told me. “It’s like a voice in the back of my head.” He can still summon distinct mental images of sun seeping through the windows of his childhood home, in Mexico City. His sensibility stems in part from his mother, an American painter. With her help, every Halloween, Prieto and his brother turned their home into a haunted house, covering the windows and walls with bedsheets and cardboard. They carved shrunken heads from dried apples and hung them from the ceiling; Prieto sculpted little monsters and their victims out of clay. Upon entering the house, his friends were greeted with bits of horror-movie soundtracks. The shrieking strings from “Psycho” were reserved for the final act: the arrival of Van Winten, a ghost incarnated by Prieto. Prieto’s father, an aeronautical engineer from Mexico, helped supply an early technical education. One visitor to the haunted house mentioned stop-motion, telling Prieto that all he needed to animate his monsters was a still camera. Prieto’s father lent him an 8-mm. Bell & Howell and explained that he could merge twenty-four still images into a second of live action. Prieto made sketches to figure out the technique, and then used it to create a short stop-motion film. When Halloween came around, he screened it on a bedsheet, and his friends were mesmerized: the figurines had taken on fearsome proportions. “It was a hitazo,” Prieto said—a huge hit. Prieto made it into Mexico’s premier film school, the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica, where he found that cinematography offered a vocation. Though his classmates all seemed to want to direct, Prieto felt that photography allowed him to play and experiment, the way he had as a child. His school projects drew the attention of Emmanuel Lubezki, a cinematographer whose work Prieto admired as daring, seductive, and refined. When Lubezki asked Prieto to work with him on a project with an up-and-coming director named Alfonso Cuarón, he agreed to do it for free. The film, “Sólo Con Tu Pareja,” brought together a generation of filmmakers in search of a new visual language. “We were all brimming with energy,” Prieto said. “It was a beautiful period.” Still, work was scarce. After NAFTA passed, the Mexican film industry was hobbled, and production stalled to as few as nine movies a year. “It was almost irresponsible to study film back then, because there was no way to make a living,” Prieto said. The release of “Amores Perros” transformed his prospects. Soon after it appeared in U.S. theatres, Prieto got a call from Oliver Stone, inviting him to his office in Santa Monica. When he arrived, Stone slid a copy of the film into a VCR and barraged him with questions. Which cameras and lenses had he used? What had the developing process involved? Then Stone asked Prieto to join him on a research trip to Africa. Within weeks, they were on a plane to Addis Ababa. Stone and Prieto went on to collaborate on six projects. “I liked his courage,” Stone told me. “I’ve seen other cameramen wilt under pressure.” They travelled to Havana, where Stone met with Fidel Castro, and to Moscow, where Vladimir Putin welcomed them to the Kremlin. While shooting a documentary about the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, Stone and Prieto were taken in a blacked-out van to a clandestine site occupied by the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. “He could work under all conditions—and they were tough conditions,” Stone said. To Iñárritu, Prieto’s greatest virtue is his flexibility, both stylistic and personal. “Many cinematographers are very talented, but, if you look at their C.V.s, they rarely work with the same director again,” he said. Prieto has maintained a series of long relationships, adapting to varied production sizes, budgets, and styles. Every film has required him to understand—and, to some extent, meld with—a director’s world view. “I’m not looking for shots, or a cool moment of lighting, or an unusual angle which will stand alone,” Prieto has said. “I’m looking for how a given shot will work for that moment in the movie, that emotional moment for the characters.” In 2003, he shot Stone’s biography of Alexander the Great—a multi-continental epic in which he captured Alexander’s near-death in battle using infrared film, tinging the scene with bloody hues. His next film was radically different: “Brokeback Mountain,” Ang Lee’s tale of two cowboys’ illicit romance in an idyllic glade in Wyoming. Here, Prieto’s mood-setting was subtler. When the men left the mountains for town, where they were no longer protected from judgment, the images grew grainier and more unsettled. Lee himself began the production in an uneasy state. His previous movie, “Hulk,” had opened to harsh reviews, including one, in the Times, that called it “incredibly long, incredibly tedious, incredibly turgid.” He was thinking of retiring, but as he worked with Prieto his faith in making movies began to return. “He’s a good soul for art,” Lee told me. “He acts like a novice—and I’m like that, too.” During the production, Lee asked Prieto to play a Mexican prostitute who solicits Jake Gyllenhaal’s character. Prieto agreed, replacing another actor at the last minute. “Ang liked his acting, but he was shorter than Jake,” Prieto said. Laughing, he added, “The backup Mexican—that was me.” In 2012, Prieto’s agent called to say that Martin Scorsese wanted to meet him the next day. “I barely had time to process it,” Prieto said. “I got on a flight to New York.” He spent the flight reading the script for “The Wolf of Wall Street.” They had their first conversation at the director’s home on the Upper East Side. Scorsese told me that they “talked through the script and worked out a very gradual shift in the visual tone and the quality of the color as Jordan Belfort goes deeper into his world, from warm to cool.” During the filming, Scorsese added, “he introduced me to so many methods and devices for making camera movements more flexible, easy to maneuver.” Along with Iñárritu, Scorsese has become Prieto’s longest collaborator, over a decade-long string of films. “Martin won’t let go of him!” Iñárritu told me, half joking. “He stole him from me.” Scorsese and Prieto share an interest in historical sweep, and in mimicking the film used by the photographers of the period being represented: Kodachrome, with its richly saturated colors, for the nineteen-fifties; Ektachrome, with its cooler tones, for the sixties and seventies. In “Killers of the Flower Moon,” an epic about Oklahoma’s oil boom, Prieto portrayed the settlers who sowed fear in the Osage Nation by emulating the Lumière brothers’ autochrome technique, which was invented around the time that white people poured into the area. To sharpen the visual contrast, Prieto photographed the Osage in natural colors. “The challenge is always figuring out the right balance,” he said. “Having a repository of techniques and knowing what to apply where, without pulling the viewer out of the film. I try to push up to that point.” There is a crucial part of the movie in which the violence against the Osage reaches the protagonist, an Indigenous woman named Mollie Burkhart. In the script, Burkhart’s family is awakened at night by a violent explosion, and, as her husband ventures outside to see what happened, she stays behind with the kids. “As it was written,” Scorsese said, “we had Mollie standing in the living room, holding the children. We all looked at each other and wondered: Why is she standing in the middle of the living room? Shouldn’t they be taking shelter somewhere?” Lily Gladstone, who plays Burkhart, suggested a storm cellar in the house where they were shooting. “We went to the cellar door,” Scorsese recalled. “I could see the looks in the faces of the crew, basically saying, ‘Please don’t let him open that door.’ I opened it, looked down. I said, ‘This is great!’ ” He turned to Prieto, who raised his eyebrows politely. “It is very easy to imagine another cinematographer—and that includes cinematographers I’ve worked with—who would have said, ‘That’s going to take too long to get it set up for today,’ ” Scorsese told me. “Rodrigo just said, ‘O.K.,’ and he went to work. It took a few hours to light and to figure out the movement, and then we shot it.” In the studio in Manhattan, the lights went down, and Prieto settled in next to one of his sound mixers, a wiry man named Rich Bologna. The film’s post-production supervisor, Vanessa Hernández, sat behind them on a leather sofa. The three had spent weeks fiddling with the sound, a phase of production that Prieto had never led before—but, he reasoned, the mind-set wasn’t that different from the one he used with lighting. He had scoured the text of “Pedro Páramo,” which has scores of references to ambient sound, for details to replicate. “They’re small things, as small as a bird’s voice or the sound of water lapping on rocks,” Prieto said. “But, taken together, they amount to something.” He asked Bologna to rewind to the opening scene. Onscreen, Juan Preciado, one of the protagonists, stood on a vast desert plain. He heard the braying of a donkey in the distance, then walked over to a man who was leading the animal. “Why are you headed to Comala, if I may ask?” the peasant said. “I’m going to see my father,” Preciado replied. “All I know is that his name is Pedro Páramo.” The peasant, with a cryptic look, said, “I’m also Pedro Páramo’s son.” The movie’s first scenes faithfully recreate the opening of the novel, as Preciado heads off on his journey. Intent on fulfilling his mother’s deathbed wish, he returns to Comala, which she had left when he was an infant. “That place sits on the burning embers of the earth, at the very mouth of Hell,” the peasant warns him. “Nobody lives here.” Netflix executives first approached Rulfo’s family about a new adaptation in 2020. “We really felt that this was the time to make the film again,” Francisco Ramos, the company’s vice-president of Latin American content, told me. Netflix had recently acquired the rights to “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” and, with the Spanish-language market growing, it wanted to expand its collection of the region’s literary masterworks. The family was skeptical. “We didn’t want to let go of the novel, because we’ve only got one,” Juan Carlos Rulfo, the author’s son, told me. The last attempt to adapt “Pedro Páramo,” in 2007, had foundered; the production, led by a Spanish filmmaker named Mateo Gil, never secured enough funds to start filming. Eventually, the family agreed to sell the rights to Netflix, but for a limited time. The company would have just four years to develop, produce, and edit the film. Ramos called up Gil, the Spanish filmmaker, whose script had sat untouched for more than a decade. Gil’s first reaction was “I can’t let you have it.” He had dreamed of adapting the movie since he was a student, and he wasn’t going to let someone else take his place. Ramos waited a year, then called again. “By then, I had come to terms with the fact that, if Netflix adapted ‘Pedro Páramo,’ there would be no room left for a second movie,” Gil told me. “Besides, I had already shed enough tears for that script.” Gil signed on, under one condition: that the script remain scrupulously faithful to the novel. “It’s the essence of my adaptation,” he said. Netflix was already talking with Prieto about directing the film, but Juan Carlos wasn’t entirely convinced. “I had serious doubts about his ability to direct,” he told me. “I worried it’d turn into an overly aesthetic movie with no depth.” (Juan Carlos, who has directed numerous documentaries, added, “I have to confess that, at one point, I wondered, ‘Will they be asking me?’ ”) Before getting started, Prieto sat down with Juan Carlos. The two men knew each other from film school; Juan Carlos had been Prieto’s camera assistant on “Sólo Con Tu Pareja.” The author’s son referred Prieto to a documentary series he had recently finished, “One Hundred Years with Juan Rulfo,” an ode to his father’s career. He had dedicated an entire episode to the film adaptations of Rulfo’s work, providing a detailed survey of the decisions that resulted in failure: casting agents selecting John Gavin, an American actor and diplomat, to play the lead; screenwriters trying to flatten the novel’s circular structure; directors struggling to interpret the work. Prieto watched all seven episodes and concluded that any version he produced would invite criticism. But, he said, “I had to set aside that fear—the fear of failure, of being judged by generations of intellectuals and literary experts. I decided to focus on producing the best film I could.” In the summer of 2022, Prieto got to work on refining the script. He was shooting “Barbie” in London, and he spent his weekends on Zoom with Gil, deliberating over Rulfo’s work. Prieto wrestled with choosing what to keep and what to leave out. “He was so enthralled with the novel that he wanted to be able to capture it all,” Gil said. “And I would tell him, ‘Rodrigo, it just doesn’t fit!’ ” They also had to contend with the realm of the dead, a prominent feature of the novel. “Those ghosts had to be dealt with somehow,” Gil said. The screenwriter believed that there needed to be a visual cue to distinguish the spectres—something as abstract as a shadow. Prieto wanted the uncertainty to remain unresolved. “It was all about sifting through and interpreting the clues present in the novel,” he said. When the time came to scout locations, Prieto looked around Aguascalientes and Tlaxcala, in central Mexico, before arriving at San Luis Potosí. As it happened, Prieto’s grandfather had grown up there, then left at sixteen to join Emiliano Zapata’s revolutionary forces. “For me, San Luis has always been some kind of a myth,” Prieto said. At family gatherings, his grandfather recounted tales of the revolution—“then my grandmother would interrupt him and say, ‘No, Jorge, that’s really not how it happened.’ ” Prieto got hold of a pile of scouting images taken for the British director Tony Scott, who had worked on a movie about Pancho Villa. In one, he found a town south of San Luis Potosí with a derelict plaza that appeared stuck in time—as if the town had been wrecked and never rebuilt, just like Comala. Prieto prepared in his habitual way: he mapped out each scene, angle by angle, in a fifty-seven-page shot list. He took inspiration from still photographs, including many taken by Rulfo, who carried a camera wherever he went. By the time Prieto arrived on set, he knew exactly when the camera would pan or tilt and how the actors should interact with it. Yet his uneasiness was evident. “At the beginning, I could sense that he was a little tense,” Ilse Salas, who plays a lead role, said. “He was very focussed on the cinematography. Little by little, he began to let go and straddle both worlds—that of the actors and the cinematography.” Another lead actress, Mayra Batalla, added, “He’s got a millimetric eye. But he reminds you constantly that it’s all a game—a very serious one, but a game after all.” As a cinematographer, Prieto had distinguished himself by putting his virtuosity in service of other directors’ visions. Making “Pedro Páramo” raised the question of whether he was capable of creating a vision of his own. Prieto knew that he wanted to keep the photography simple; the structure and content of the novel were complex enough. Nico Aguilar, a young filmmaker who worked with Prieto on the cinematography, told me that he seemed guided by a self-effacing principle: “How do I make myself as invisible as possible, in order to make the story as loud as possible?” Last March, Rulfo’s family was invited to a private screening at Netflix’s office in downtown Mexico City. Juan Carlos deflected the invitation more than once. “I didn’t want to see it,” he said. Ultimately, he and his wife attended, along with several of his siblings. “We were very pleased,” he said. Juan Carlos believed that his father would’ve felt similarly about the movie. “ ‘It could’ve been more mysterious,’ is probably what El Jefe would’ve said,” he surmised. “But I think he would really have liked to see that he was taken into account.” Since the film’s release, last November, critics have been divided over whether Prieto was too reverent toward Rulfo’s work. In the U.S., where the book is largely unknown, many suggested that the film would have been better served by a bolder revision, marked by grand visual metaphors. In Latin America, there has been a wider appreciation of Prieto’s achievement. No director before him had matched the novel’s originality in visual form—let alone with painterly beauty and nuanced performances. As one review put it, Prieto’s success was in translating “the novel’s narrative complexity to film.” In the private screening, one sequence made Juan Carlos bristle. At the death of a key character, Prieto introduced a scene of his own invention, in which scores of bodies float in the sky, spinning like a tornado. “The murmurs cease,” Prieto wrote in his shot list. “And there is complete silence.” His intention was to give more gravitas to a key passage in the novel—and, for that, he had had to stray from it. Why? Juan Carlos asked. “Because I wanted to,” Prieto replied. ♦ A photographer’s college classmates, then and now.

        "text": "A new account of the papacy’s recent history reveals the transformation of the office in the mass-media age. “Gandhi’s Scant Garb Bars Audience with Pope.” So read the headline of a New York Times report, from December 13, 1931, that the Vatican had cancelled a meeting between Pius XI and “the Indian nationalist leader” because the Pope thought he might be criticized “if he received the visitor in his usual scanty clothing.” Last December, ninety-three years later, the Times published an excerpt from Pope Francis’s autobiography titled “There Is Faith in Humor,” which related jokes told by and about the clergy, and was meant to show that they are not merely “bitter, sad priests.” That the papacy has changed over the past century almost goes without saying. John XXIII, who was elected Pope in 1958, called an ecumenical council, only the twenty-first in the nearly two-thousand-year history of the Church. Paul VI left the Vatican for trips to Bombay, Jerusalem, New York City, and Bogotá. John Paul II stood shoulder to shoulder with the Dalai Lama and the chief rabbi of Rome during an interfaith prayer for peace held in Assisi. Benedict XVI resigned, the first Pope to do so in six hundred years. Discover notable new fiction and nonfiction. Those acts betoken a more significant change. The Second Vatican Council, held from 1962 to 1965, was expected to diminish the Pope and foreground ordinary Catholics, by defining the Church as “the people of God,” rather than Roman Catholicism as the one true faith, led by the Pope. But, in the developed world, the Pope has become more rather than less central to Catholic life: a monarch, a cleric, a celebrity, and a fellow-believer all in one. This shift was brought on by John XXIII’s charm and the drama of Vatican II, and was deepened by an unexpected run of events in 1978—when Paul VI died, an August conclave elected the affable Venetian prelate Albino Luciani as John Paul I, and then Luciani died after just a month in office, prompting the conclave that elected the first non-Italian pope since 1523, Karol Wojtyła of Krakow, who took the name John Paul II. Meanwhile, the everyday lives of ordinary believers became less distinctly Catholic. Parish life thinned out as urban Catholics moved to the suburbs; Catholic schools withered as the underpaid labor of nuns and priests became less available. Into the denuded spaces of Catholic life came the figure of “JPII”: featured on the cover of Time magazine, celebrating Mass in stadiums and parks, denouncing a “culture of death.” John Paul drew on his personal charisma to re-root Church authority in the Vatican and the Pope. He made use of the mass media, which amplified the authentic drama of his journeys and of the conflicts stirred up by his pronouncements en route (about the ordination of women, say, or divorce, or liberation theology). This pattern, established across his nearly twenty-seven years in the papal office, has borne on his successors, Benedict and Francis. In consequence, the papacy has become the center of both Catholic vitality and Catholic controversy. Where once Catholics focussed on the spectacle of Mass, led in Latin by a priest whose back was turned, now we focus on the spectacle of the Pope and the contretemps involving him, set against the background of Vatican glamour and inscrutability. Brick-and-mortar Catholicism is a diminished thing, and yet even the lapsedest Catholics, and people generally, remain curious about the Pope. I read “Jesus Wept,” a fleet and vivid new history of the papacy in the mass-media age, with all this in mind. The author, Philip Shenon, a former investigative reporter for the Times who has written books about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the 9/11 Commission, introduces the book as “an investigative history of the modern Roman Catholic Church.” The topics are familiar—disputes over sexual mores, war and peace, church and state, money, and the reach of Vatican authority—and so are the author’s assessments of them: the problem is that the churchmen who run things are corrupt, secretive, hypocritical, and illiberal. But the depth of Shenon’s reporting, combined with his narrative’s strict observance of chronology, gives fresh emphasis to material lost in the churn of the news cycle. Shenon draws deftly from the vast public record, and also relies on, by his account, “hundreds of interviews,” with sources “who took the risk of speaking to me . . . most on the understanding that I would not reveal their names.” The presence of anonymous sources inside the Vatican is everywhere implied, as he adopts the points of view of his protagonists (“Walter Kasper, so rare to show anger, was fed up”), sums up the collective mood of the Roman Curia (whose members are “shocked” and “outraged”), and relates encounters in melodramatic paraphrase (“Levada rushed to Benedict to tell him what was in the files, and the pope instantly realized that it had been a terrible mistake to keep McCarrick in place in Washington”). Often, the never-before-told quality of the material is undermined by the standard-issue telling—there are “battles” over doctrine and authority, “clashes” between theologians, and deskbound clerics inciting “terror” through this or that “crusade.” But the narrative is alive, intricate, and reliable, and it suggests a comprehensive insight about Catholicism in our time: since the nineteen-sixties, the interplay of spectacle and controversy involving the papacy, and the striking changes in the ways the Popes comport themselves, has diverted attention away from grave matters such as clerical sex abuse, and all the surface agitation about what the Pope says and does has masked the Church’s stubborn resistance to change. Shenon’s book begins not with the Second Vatican Council, which John XXIII characterized as “opening the windows” of a self-enclosed Church, but with the pontificate of Pius XII, who was elected twenty years earlier, in 1939. This setting-off point serves as a reminder that the council wasn’t prompted by secular modernity or the emerging sexual revolution but by a need for the Church to revise its approach to other churches and other religions. The Holocaust, and Pius XII’s decision not to speak out directly against the Nazis’ extermination of Jews, forced the Church, after the Second World War, to take a critical view of its long history of treating the Jewish people as collective enemies of itself and of Christ—a position expressed in the Latin Mass, which, on Good Friday, referred to “perfidious Jews” who had turned over Jesus to the Roman authorities, and alleged that the “blood of Jesus falls . . . on all generations of Jews up to the end of the world.” That outlook was a basis for centuries of civic and institutional antisemitism in Europe and elsewhere, but many individual Catholics saw things differently. Archbishop Angelo Roncalli had worked to save Jews while serving as nuncio, or ambassador, to Turkey, early in the Second World War, and had spent much of his time there in the company of Orthodox Christians and Muslims. After Pius’s death, in October, 1958, Roncalli was elected Pope and took the name John XXIII. He called the council three months later, and invited Protestant and Orthodox churches to send representatives. He also tasked the German Jesuit and Biblical scholar Augustin Bea with drafting a document that would mend relations with other Christians and, Shenon writes, help “to end the most ancient rupture of all—between the church and the Jews.” The transition from the Latin Mass to a new rite in local languages began in 1964. By then, John had died, and a new Pope, Paul VI—the former Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Battista Montini—had gone to Jerusalem, seeking symbolic expression of the new Catholic-Jewish amity. Bea’s draft document on the Church’s relations with Judaism and other non-Christian religions, completed in 1965, was met with “ferocious opposition from a handful of archconservatives,” Shenon writes. It was saved only after a protest—led by the charismatic Swiss theologian and priest Hans Küng—became a news story in Europe, shaming Pope Paul into supporting it. The document, titled “Nostra Aetate” (“In Our Time”), was ratified during the council’s final session, in December, 1965. Whereas the Vatican had long maintained that “outside the Church there is no salvation,” and that “error has no rights,” now it granted that “God holds the Jews most dear for the sake of their Fathers” and insisted that the Church “rejects nothing that is true or holy” in other religions. “Nostra Aetate,” then, stands as a sign that Catholicism really can change, and the controversy over it suggested that media attention could compel a Pope, in Küng’s words, to “do the right thing.” In Central and South America, Paul is associated with the 1967 encyclical “Populorum Progressio” (“On the Development of Peoples”), which placed the Church nominally on the side of the poor and sparked populist Catholic activism across the region. In Europe and the United States, Paul is remembered for rejecting, in 1968, a papal commission’s recommendation that the Church authorize the use of birth control, prompting many Catholics to ignore the ban or leave the Church altogether. “By 1975,” Shenon writes, “the pope was so angry about defiance of his teachings that he directed the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith to prepare a document to state—authoritatively, for all time—the church’s views on sexual morality.” The resulting document, “Persona Humana” (“The Human Person”), drew particular attention for its declaration that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” That declaration, Shenon writes, led Pope Paul to be “plunged into the gravest, most humiliating crisis of his life.” Paul had long been subject to rumors that he’d had intimate friendships with a film actor and other men while Archbishop of Milan, and, in 1976, the Italian magazine Tempo published a long article about the rumors, prompting the Italian police to impound the magazine from newsstands. Ignoring the advice of subordinates, Paul decried what he referred to as “horrible and slanderous insinuations” during his weekly address from an open window of the papal apartment, which overlooks St. Peter’s Square—an act equal parts dramatic and vague, which yielded an Associated Press story with the headline “POPE PAUL VI DENIES HE IS HOMOSEXUAL.” John Paul II’s pontificate played out even more emphatically in the public eye. He transformed the role and visage of the Pope through his “apostolic journeys”: in the course of a hundred and four trips, he travelled to a hundred and twenty-nine countries, each visit typically involving Masses, parades, speeches, press events, photo ops, and the canonization of local saints. And he placed the figure of the Pope at the center of controversies over priestly ordination, divorce, contraception, the Church’s history with Jews in Poland, and its present dealings in politics there and in Latin America. The press covered those conflicts doggedly, and focussed on the outsized role played in them by the Bavarian theologian Joseph Ratzinger, who was brought to the Vatican in 1982 to head the doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Ratzinger, though often depicted as shy and abstrusely professorial, was an expressive speaker, and, as Shenon tells it, once in Rome he began to “court publicity—and, at times, outrage.” Breaking with precedent for curial officials, he “granted hours of interviews to a little-known Italian journalist, Vittorio Messori, for what would be a book-length profile,” “The Ratzinger Report,” published in 1985 in Italian, German, and English. Shenon calls the book “a declaration of war on virtually all progressive thinking,” and relates, without giving a source, that “many assumed that Ratzinger had been grossly misquoted, since the comments attributed to him were so outrageous. In fact, he read the manuscript in advance—and approved it.” Across the next quarter century, Ratzinger’s strict and straight approach to Catholic doctrine and teachings on sexual morality drew intense media coverage. But the attention paid to his campaigns against progressive Catholic thought served to distract attention from a criminal scandal—the thousands of acts of clerical sexual abuse of minors committed in the postwar decades. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under Ratzinger, had responsibility to address all reports of clerical sexual abuse, past and recent, that reached the Vatican—and the power either to deal with them or to do nothing. Shenon emphasizes that “within weeks of arriving in Rome,” Ratzinger “received detailed briefings about priestly sex-abuse cases in several countries, many involving the molestation of children.” Three years later, in 1985, the trial and conviction of the Reverend Gilbert Gauthe, who had sexually abused several dozen boys in Louisiana, made headlines in the U.S. and internationally. In 1988, Shenon notes, Australian bishops set up a commission to look into clerical sex abuse, and the Irish bishops had taken out joint-liability insurance the previous year. Ratzinger, however, later maintained that “for years after his arrival in Rome, he did not suspect that sexual abuse was a significant problem anywhere.” One instance of sexual abuse in a Catholic institution was so near to Ratzinger that any claim of ignorance on his part strains credulity. A report published in 2010 revealed that at least sixty-seven members of the Regensburger Domspatzen, a boys’ choir led by Ratzinger’s elder brother Georg, were abused across the three decades he was in charge. By then, Ratzinger had become Pope Benedict XVI, succeeding John Paul II, who died in 2005. A German abuse-survivors’ group, Shenon notes, posed the obvious question: How could Ratzinger, who had lived in Regensburg for most of the nineteen-seventies and who spent time with Georg regularly then and afterward, not have known “ ‘what was happening to these innocent boys who were under his brother’s care?’ The pope insisted that he had never suspected any mistreatment.” In retrospect, Ratzinger was manifestly the wrong man for the top job: too old, too retiring, too rigid, too sapped by past controversies to make a fresh start. So the question of why he was elected Pope arises—a question Shenon deepens but doesn’t resolve. Drawing on memoirs and reports published since the 2005 papal election, he reconstructs a midnight quandary of the kind evoked in the current film “Conclave.” After the first vote, Ratzinger was the front-runner, trailed by two Jesuits: Jorge Mario Bergoglio, of Buenos Aires, and Carlo Maria Martini, of Milan. Martini was a key figure in a group of churchmen who met annually in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to ponder how best to blunt John Paul and Ratzinger’s reactionary thrust. But he was in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, and he’d made it clear that if elected he would stand aside. To whom, then, should the votes in his support go? To his friend Bergoglio—a fellow-Jesuit, cerebral and affable, sixty-eight and healthy? No: evidently, the votes went to Ratzinger, who was elected Pope the next day. Shenon speculates that Martini made a deal with Ratzinger, pledging him the votes but forcing Ratzinger to promise that if elected he would reform the Curia and would resign if he failed to do so. This is made plausible by Benedict’s resignation, in 2013, after crippling scandals in the Vatican. But Martini’s distaste for John Paul’s and Ratzinger’s leadership—and the traditionalism they espoused—was surely deeper than his concern over a Curia run amok. The Catholic Church “is 200 years out of date,” Martini told the Italian daily Corriere della Serra, shortly before his death, in 2012. “Our churches are big and empty. Our rituals and our cassocks are pompous. The church must admit its mistakes and begin a radical change.” Especially since Benedict’s death, in 2022, I have often wondered: What if the man now known as Pope Francis had been elected in 2005, not in 2013, and had taken office at age sixty-eight, with the backing of a group of cardinals committed to change? That is the great counterfactual of the papacy in this century. But it’s far from clear that Francis, in any circumstances, would have brought the “radical” change that Martini called for. His humble persona might not have captivated the press had he succeeded the dynamic John Paul rather than the rigorist Benedict. And, although the casual and flexible style he adopted early on led him to be cast as a “revolutionary” by progressives and traditionalists alike, he is a moderate man. Shenon writes, of Francis’s first decade as Pope, “He had dramatically changed the tone of Vatican debates, with an emphasis always on promoting mercy over punishing sin. But little had changed in terms of formal church teachings. Francis’s promise to reconsider the doctrine of priestly celibacy had gone nowhere . . . the church’s ban on birth control remained in place, even if it was more widely mocked and ignored than ever. Despite his vow to promote women to the Curia, there was still only token representation of women at the highest reaches of the Vatican. He had shown mercy to divorced Catholics by allowing them to remarry more easily through annulments and to receive Communion, but a future pope could erase those initiatives as easily as Francis had put them into place.” The recent history that Shenon has brought together suggests that the next Pope will be a figure of consequence, like his predecessors, and a symbol of change. But it also suggests that the very forces of tradition, ritual, loyalty, and secrecy that empower the Pope also stand in the way of any thoroughgoing renewal of Catholicism. In the circumstances, then, the succession from one Pope to the next—the Italian, the Pole, the German, the Argentinean; the kindly uncle, the man of action, the scholar, the Jesuit; the liberal, the conservative, the traditionalist, the moderate—is a simulacrum of more substantive change. ♦ A photographer’s college classmates, then and now.

        "title": "Nicholas Ray’s Hollywood Counterculture | The New Yorker",
        "text": "Last Saturday, as part of “Tales from The New Yorker,” a two-week program at Film Forum that celebrates the magazine’s centenary with movies that have a connection to its writers and their work, I introduced a screening of Nicholas Ray’s 1956 melodrama “Bigger Than Life,” which is based on an Annals of Medicine piece titled “Ten Feet Tall,” by Berton Roueché, in the September 10, 1955, issue. I’ve been somewhat obsessed by this film for decades and have written about it before, but, to prepare my introduction, I read up on its genesis, and this new angle of entry proved revelatory—regarding not just the film but the history of cinema and Ray’s distinctive place in that history. In the backstory of “Bigger Than Life,” the spirit of its cinematic times emerges, and reverberates even to the present day. Roueché’s article is about a schoolteacher in Queens who falls severely ill with a malady that his doctors struggle to diagnose. While in the hospital, he’s found to have a rare vascular inflammation that’s invariably fatal. But he is given a newly developed medicine—cortisone (and the related substance ACTH)—and recovers, returning home to his wife and young son and resuming work. There is a side effect, however: drug-induced psychosis. The teacher gets delusions of grandeur, behaving tyrannically toward his family. He yields to wild impulses and endures crushing mood swings. His behavior strains his marriage. Eventually, his doctors adjust his treatment so that he can stay both healthy and sane. The movie version is set in an anonymous suburb, and it stars James Mason—who also produced the film—as Ed Avery, the teacher. Barbara Rush co-stars as Ed’s wife, Lou; Christopher Olsen plays their son; and Walter Matthau plays Ed’s gym-teacher colleague. The project came together while Ray was in Europe, in late 1955, to promote “Rebel Without a Cause,” starring James Dean. Mason found the story and pitched it to Twentieth Century Fox, where he was under contract. After seeing “Rebel,” he chose Ray, also under contract at Fox, to direct, and Ray, reading the story in Paris, was enthusiastic. By the time Ray got back to Hollywood, in January, 1956, a script had already been written by Richard Maibaum, who later made his name writing thirteen James Bond movies, and a former novelist named Cyril Hume. (The making of the film is detailed in a biography of Ray by the French critic Bernard Eisenschitz, from 1990, and another, by Patrick McGilligan, from 2011.) Ray didn’t like the script; Mason was willing to work with Ray on a revision, but Ray wanted to bring in the playwright Clifford Odets (then also in Hollywood) to redo it. Mason refused this request. But Ray—together with Gavin Lambert, a British writer who was romantically involved with Ray and was hired officially as a dialogue director but who was Ray’s unofficial artistic consultant—consulted Odets nonetheless. Ray had a big problem with the ending, and he snuck Odets onto the set to revise it, on a portable typewriter. According to Mason, three studio executives, getting wind of Odets’s presence, stormed toward the set to prevent Ray from filming what hadn’t been “approved.” Mason, with admirable confidence in his director, headed them off. The studio did succeed in preventing Ray from changing some parts of the script, but the director had other ways of fixing things, as Lambert writes in his extraordinary memoir, “Mainly About Lindsay Anderson”: Forbidden to make a point verbally, Nick had an extraordinary flair\nfor making it visually. He wanted to add some dialogue about the\nmedical profession’s carelessness in prescribing new “wonder drugs”\nwhose side effects had not been thoroughly monitored, but under\npressure from the American Medical Association, the studio vetoed the\nidea. So he cast some tough-looking actors to play the doctors, and\nshot them nearly always on the move, in dark-suited, gangsterish\ncabals of two and three. “How I shoot depends on what I want to get\naway with—to fool the censor, the front office, whoever—or how\nconfident I feel about the scene as written,” Nick told me. With classic Hollywood, don’t believe the credits: the better the filmmaker, the greater the involvement in the various elements of production. On “Bigger Than Life,” Ray’s sole credit is as director, but he was closely involved in the writing and the editing, and much more besides. He played a key role in the production design, and his use of color is startling, eerie, disruptive. The movie is full of eye-catching colors: high-style dresses that Ed forces Lou to try on; a red jacket (as in “Rebel Without a Cause”) that their son wears; the red edging of Ed’s Bible; above all, a strange little purple bottle of Ed’s medicine. The movie’s lurid hues come off as ominous intrusions, disturbances of the regular order. Ray wasn’t the cinematographer (Joseph MacDonald was), but, under Ray’s direction, the film—shot in the widescreen CinemaScope format—departed significantly from industry norms. Defying professional orthodoxies about keeping widescreen framings wide and widescreen editing simple, Ray relies copiously on closeups, quick montages, and distorting and disorienting diagonal angles. Ray’s basic problem with the original script, by Maibaum and Hume, was that, sticking close to Roueché’s article, it remained narrowly a tale of medical mystery. As Lambert recalled, Ray “found the relationship between the schoolteacher and his wife very shallow, the medical details presented ‘with shots of test tubes and microscopes straight out of The Story of Louis Pasteur [1936],’ and the ending anticlimactic.” Maibaum complained (in an interview by McGilligan) about the director’s reworking of the film: “Ray exaggerated some scenes and diluted others. Some directors don’t realize that there are scenes that are like music: if you knock out a few notes, it becomes discordant.” In “Bigger Than Life,” Ray turned a medical mystery into an existential disaster. He treats the drug as something like a truth serum that pushes Ed Avery’s petty discontents to radical extremes, his increasingly deranged ideas expressing things that were latent: his boredom with the people in his milieu and with himself, his disdain for the frivolity of mass culture, his frustration with his job’s bureaucratic routine. Ed’s monstrous behavior under the influence of cortisone shatters the veneer of middle-class gentility to reveal the fault lines repressed beneath it. In his marriage, solicitude becomes control; at school and at home, education becomes despotism. Commonplace virtues turn toward vice: compassion veers toward deceit, attentive parenting toward either laxity or oppressiveness, friendship toward jealousy or contempt, sociability toward falsehood or cruelty. This fraying of all basic bonds leaves everyone—whether in the family, the workplace, the neighborhood, or the social set—irreparably alone. Ray made “Bigger Than Life” not discordant but atonal. In certain circles, the name of Nicholas Ray is something of a meme, nearly a punch line. Just as Jerry Lewis’s name is almost synonymous with “They love him in France,” Ray’s name is practically a synonym for “auteur.” In the fifties, for the young French critics at the magazine Cahiers du Cinéma—who would soon become the French New Wave directors—Ray was more than a hero; he was an exemplar. Writing in 1955, François Truffaut called him “an auteur in our sense of the word,” and Éric Rohmer said that both he and his fellow-critic Jacques Rivette considered Ray to be “the greatest . . . of the new generation of American filmmakers.” In 1957, Jean-Luc Godard wrote, “If the cinema no longer existed, Nicholas Ray alone gives the impression of being capable of reinventing it, and what is more, of wanting to,” and, the following year, declared, “The cinema is Nicholas Ray.” For his part, Ray was deeply gratified by these young French cinephiles’ love for his films, because, in the United States, he was nearly anonymous, and his unorthodox films were often reviewed harshly. By contrast, as Ray put it, at Cahiers, Arts (where Truffaut wrote), and the British magazine Sight and Sound (which Lambert edited), “The contact was established.” Yet there was something paradoxical about the Cahiers critics’ fervor for Ray. They had got the nickname the Hitchcocko-Hawksians because the two Hollywood filmmakers for whom they asserted their case most vigorously and insistently were Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. (In 1952, Godard called Hawks “the greatest American artist.”) But those directors, who were born in the eighteen-nineties and started their directorial careers in the nineteen-twenties, were of a different generation than Ray, who was born in 1911, and who didn’t make his first film, “They Live by Night,” until 1948. That was the same year that the young Rivette made his first (albeit D.I.Y.) film; for France’s young critics, Ray seemed almost a contemporary. Moreover, Hitchcock and Hawks were Hollywood insiders, well regarded in the industry as showmen and craftsmen, albeit not as artists (something they’d never have claimed publicly, though they were). Ray, however, was temperamentally an outsider, not least because he was open about who he was and what kind of ambitions he had. In this regard, too, he was the young French critics’ peer. He self-consciously defined the cinema as art and likened his own work to that of an author, telling the Cahiers critic Charles Bitsch, in 1958, “The camera is an instrument, it’s the microscope that makes it possible to detect the melody of the gaze. It’s a magnificent instrument, because its microscopic power is, for me, the equivalent of a writer’s introspection, and the unspooling of film in the camera represents, in my view, the writer’s stream of thought.” Though he didn’t make this declaration until he was already lionized in France, the attitude it expresses had been on clear display in his work from the start, along with a sense of solitude and alienation, as suggested even by some of his best films’ titles: “In a Lonely Place,” “On Dangerous Ground,” “Rebel Without a Cause.” Ray told Bitsch that his “personal label” was “I’m a stranger here myself,” which is also a line delivered in Ray’s 1954 Western, “Johnny Guitar,” by Sterling Hayden, who, in the title role, gives the coolest performance in any classic Hollywood movie—except, maybe, for James Dean, in “Rebel.” Ray and Dean had become close friends and formed their own production company, planning to make two movies together in short order; Dean died before they could realize their plans. Ray wanted another king of attitude to star in his next film, “The True Story of Jesse James”: Elvis Presley. (The studio gave him Robert Wagner instead.) Unlike Hitchcock, Hawks, or any other Hollywood director of the era, Ray was a figure of the counterculture. In the early nineteen-fifties (even the late forties), he was already a person of the sixties—not just before the Beatles but before the Beats. It’s hard to think of anyone who played a similar role so prominently at the time. Despite working in a lucrative and glitzy field, he was essentially a bohemian peer of John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Dylan Thomas. Hitchcock and Hawks weren’t outsiders; they cloaked their boldness in bonhomie. And Orson Welles, though younger than Ray, having been born in 1915, nonetheless seemed older, having achieved fame and artistic greatness during the Depression. Ray, although in his forties, was at one with youth in revolt. What is an auteur? It’s not a director who makes films that look a certain way, not a filmmaker who pursues a set of themes consistently over the course of a career. It’s not a status that can be proved empirically, because the idea of the auteur—of the director as the cinematic counterpart to, and equal of, the writer of a novel—isn’t a theory. It’s an experience, a sense of immediate communication with an artist who’s nowhere on the screen and yet everywhere in the movie. It’s the awareness that there is somebody there, whose movie is in effect a first-person discourse—which is to say, it’s an essentially literary, metaphorical phenomenon, not an empirical one. The analysis of style, form, and content belongs to critics everywhere; but the young Cahiers critics, in conjuring the characters of directors, were watching films not as critics but as the artists that they intended to be and, by temperament, already were. They treated criticism as an artistic activity and then proved its validity with the movies that they went on to make. And the artist they recognized most keenly and embraced most fervently was the one who, of all Hollywood filmmakers, was most like themselves—or like how they wanted to be. To watch movies auteuristically is to watch them like an artist; to deny the primacy of directorial art and ascribe authorship to the system is to watch movies like a suit. ♦ A photographer’s college classmates, then and now.

        "title": "An 1887 Opera by a Black Composer Finally Surfaces | The New Yorker",
        "text": "In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, in 2020, and the cultural upheavals that ensued, classical-music organizations began including more composers of color in their programs. The Philadelphia Orchestra recorded the symphonies of the early-twentieth-century Black composer Florence Price. The National Symphony did the same for the modernist George Walker. The Metropolitan Opera presented two works by Terence Blanchard. Jessie Montgomery, Carlos Simon, Huang Ruo, and other nonwhite composers benefitted from an upsurge of performances. These initiatives elicited predictable backlash from musty corners of the Internet, where it was said that D.E.I. radicals were promoting mediocrities and trashing the canon. Yet apprehensions of a classical “great replacement” proved unfounded. A 2024 report by the Institute for Composer Diversity showed that seventy-six per cent of works played at American orchestras were still by Caucasian males. Furthermore, only sixteen per cent of pieces by underrepresented composers lasted longer than twenty minutes—evidence that administrators were making token gestures of inclusion while saving the prime spots for the usual suspects. Those who scowled at such modest steps in programming are presumably hailing the Trump regime’s ugly crusade against D.E.I., which has broadened into an assault on decades of civil-rights progress. President Donald Trump has crowned himself the chairman of the Kennedy Center and complained about its “wokey” events. As a result, Renée Fleming, Ben Folds, Issa Rae, and others have cut ties with the center. The remainder of the classical world appears, at first glance, relatively unaffected. But, as 2025-26 seasons are announced in the coming weeks, subscribers might look to see whether progressive programming is being quietly rolled back. Will opera companies become nervous about politically pointed works? Will Trump-friendly artists get a boost? Will formerly disgraced Russian performers return to American halls? Will solidarity with Ukrainians dissipate? Because orchestras, opera houses, and festivals rely almost entirely on private funding, they ought to be in a position to resist Trump’s stabs at Stalinist control. The question, though, is whether even the slightest hint of trouble—a commission for a transgender composer that annoys a reactionary board member, a Latino-oriented series that receives closely monitored N.E.A. funding—will trigger what Timothy Snyder calls anticipatory obedience. In more than a few cases, organizations seemingly launched diversity programs not out of a committed belief but out of a fear of being chastised on social media. Now fear could push them in the opposite direction. This dire moment in American history is forcing a test of character. As Thomas Mann said, in another fraught period, there is no escaping politics in the arts. A couple of weeks after the Inauguration, I attended a concert performance of Edmond Dédé’s opera “Morgiane” at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, at the University of Maryland, just outside Washington. Dédé was a Black composer born in 1827 in New Orleans. In 1855, he immigrated to France, where he made his way as a composer and conductor. “Morgiane,” which he completed in 1887, was intended to be his breakthrough, but no one took it up. The score resurfaced in 2008, in the collections of Houghton Library, at Harvard. The Washington-based company Opera Lafayette and the New Orleans group OperaCréole came together to bring “Morgiane” to life; its first outing was at St. Louis Cathedral, in New Orleans, in January. “Morgiane” displays sufficient inspiration that it would have merited attention no matter who had composed it. With Dédé’s personal story in mind, the undertaking became essential. The little that is known of Dédé is gathered in Sally McKee’s 2017 book, “The Exile’s Song,” alongside vivid evocations of the social and artistic worlds through which he moved. In New Orleans, he was shaped by a culturally flourishing Black population, with its manifold Haitian connections. He also had the advantage of growing up in what was then America’s opera capital; the genre had yet to find a stable home in New York. The Théâtre d’Orléans hosted a polished opera troupe that presented the latest French works, as well as Mozart and other classics. And, though New Orleans theatres were segregated, Black opera lovers enthusiastically filled the upper tiers. We don’t know whether Dédé attended the opera in his youth, but “Morgiane” gives the impression that he was steeped in the art form from an early age. He knows all the tricks. Deteriorating conditions for people of color in New Orleans likely precipitated Dédé’s decision to seek his fortunes abroad. After failing to gain admittance to the Paris Conservatory—he was too old to do so—he attended classes as an auditor, studying with Fromental Halévy, the composer of “La Juive.” Dédé later moved to Bordeaux, where he first took a job conducting at the Grand-Théâtre and then supervised more popular fare at cafés-concerts, or music halls. In 1893, he briefly returned to New Orleans, where he felt ill at ease. He died in Paris in 1901. Scattered glimpses of his personality suggest a man of imposing presence and intelligence. The libretto of “Morgiane,” by a Bordeaux journalist named Louis Brunet, tells a not especially compelling story inspired by “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.” As the opera begins, a young woman named Amine is marrying Ali, while her mother, Morgiane, and her stepfather, Hassan, look on. Then Amine is kidnapped by a functionary of a Persian sultan—shades of Mozart’s “Abduction from the Seraglio.” Ali, Morgiane, and Hassan disguise themselves as entertainers and infiltrate the Sultan’s court. Eventually, Morgiane reveals that the Sultan is, in fact, Amine’s father. The Sultan repents and sets her free. The choice to situate the action entirely in a mythical Middle East mitigates the Orientalism of the piece; there is really no Other here. Nothing in “Morgiane” betrays the awkwardness of a first-time composer. The melodies exude charm; the harmonic design mirrors the changing moods of the plot; the climaxes are surely plotted. Gounod and Massenet are clear influences, but Mozart and Offenbach are also present. Dédé indulges in jangling percussion but avoids crude, exoticizing gestures. One allusion jumped out at me. In the prelude to the fourth act, set in the Sultan’s prison, cellos and bassoons play an upward line that resembles the lyrical second theme of Beethoven’s Violin Concerto. Given Beethoven’s associations with revolutionary liberation, this seems a deliberate nod. Particularly distinctive is the orchestration, which makes heavy use of winds and brass. Dédé’s father, Basile, played clarinet in New Orleans, and that sound may have mixed with opera in his son’s ears. When Morgiane furnishes proof to the Sultan that Amine is his daughter, she sings a lullaby-like arietta in A major, and a solo horn accompanies her with sympathetic reserve, first intoning the single note E and then unfolding a winsome countermelody. Here and elsewhere, the intermingling of voices and instruments is masterly. Mary Elizabeth Williams, a soprano with a strong lower extension, was mesmerizing in the title role, her superb diction giving emotional edge to a sometimes wooden text. Kenneth Kellogg brought an almost Wagnerian weight to the Sultan. Chauncey Packer, Joshua Conyers, Jonathan Woody, and Nicole Cabell gave persuasive accounts of the other roles. Singers from OperaCréole constituted the chorus. Patrick Dupre Quigley conducted expertly, though I wished at times for more zest and bite in the playing. Let’s hope that an opera house with lavish resources—whether in the United States or France—soon gives “Morgiane” a full staging. The year Dédé died, Louis Armstrong was born. Givonna Joseph, the co-founder of OperaCréole, noted in a pre-performance discussion that Armstrong had adored opera. Legends of Dédé’s French career circulated in New Orleans, and the young Armstrong might have heard them. When the jazz titan echoed coloratura in his improvisations, he was not borrowing from a foreign source: opera belonged to him as it belonged to all. ♦ A photographer’s college classmates, then and now.

        "text": "With spring comes fresh air, and rebirth. This is especially true on the packed culture horizon, which includes visits from Japanese Breakfast, Mary J. Blige, and Kim Gordon, a strong slate of Broadway revivals—Betty Boop! Gilbert and Sullivan! Chekhov, Williams, Mamet!—a newly renovated Frick Collection, plus the welcome return of “The Threepenny Opera” and PBS’s “Wolf Hall.” There are also movies from Wes Anderson, Ryan Coogler, and David Cronenberg, and, thank goodness—it’s almost summer, after all—a new “Mission Impossible.” Your subscription makes it possible for our critics to canvass the cultural landscape and bring you the best shows, films, concerts, exhibitions, and pop-ups in New York City and beyond—thank you for letting Goings On be your guide to the season.—Shauna Lyon Jump to: Contemporary Music | The Theatre | Art | Dance | Classical Music | Television | Movies As the memoirist Michelle Zauner, of “Crying in H Mart” fame, returns to her musical project Japanese Breakfast (National Sawdust; March 19), she sets the tone for a spring concert slate of renewal and reëmergence. Trevor Powers, who brought his Youth Lagoon project out of retirement in 2023, shares glowing new music built around unearthed home videos, at Warsaw, on April 24. After losing his wife and creative partner, Mimi Parker, to cancer, ending the band Low, Alan Sparhawk wades through distorted solo songs of grief at Elsewhere (April 2). Wide-ranging jazz acts manifest the genre’s myriad paths. The L.A. soul and hip-hop producer and composer Adrian Younge, co-founder of Jazz Is Dead, arranges a ten-piece orchestra at Sultan Room (March 4-5). The British saxophonist and bandleader Nubya Garcia brings her epic 2024 album, “Odyssey,” to Music Hall of Williamsburg (April 5). On March 30, at Carnegie Hall, Samara Joy shows off the pipes that won her the Grammy for Best New Artist in 2023. Blurring the line between traditional and exploratory are Saul Williams (Blue Note; May 27-28) and the trio of the pianist Vijay Iyer, the saxophonist Henry Threadgill, and the drummer Dafnis Prieto (Jazz Gallery; May 30-31). As K-pop continues to take over the Top Forty, members of its gate-crashing supergroups, BLACKPINK’s Jennie (Radio City Music Hall; March 10) and BTS’s j-hope (Barclays Center; March 13-14), set out on their own. A bit more cutting edge is ARTMS, a spinoff girl group whose 2024 début, “<Dall>,” pushed a historically twee genre toward the experimental (Town Hall; April 4). For the inverse, look no further than the British auteur FKA Twigs, whose tantalizing new album, “Eusexua,” recasts her avant-garde work for the club (Knockdown Center; April 3-4). Other titans of niche electronic music convene in Brooklyn. At Public Records, catch the multi-instrumentalist and dance-music maestro Ela Minus (March 18) and the ambient minimalist Tim Hecker (April 29-May 1). Darkside, a duo made up of Nicolás Jaar and Dave Harrington, brings “Nothing,” its first album in four years, to Brooklyn Steel (March 21-22). On March 25, at Warsaw, the Welsh producer Kelly Lee Owens drifts off into the euphoria of “Dreamstate.” But the season is dominated by artists experiencing a late-career bloom. At Beacon Theatre, the Portishead singer Beth Gibbons performs her solo début, “Lives Outgrown” (April 1). The queen of hip-hop soul Mary J. Blige takes on a home-town enthronement at Madison Square Garden (April 10). The singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, who has continued churning out classic Americana into her seventies, appears as a special guest for Heart’s Royal Flush tour (Radio City Music Hall; April 16). At Pioneer Works, Kim Gordon carries on her one-woman noise movement (May 2). And, in the spirit of restoration, the partners Gillian Welch and David Rawlings pay tribute to the rebuilt Woodland studio that defined their folk-fusionist sound (Carnegie Hall; May 7-8).—Sheldon Pearce The retro atmosphere is strong this spring, kicking off with such musicals as Bob Martin, Susan Birkenhead, and David Foster’s “Boop!” (Broadhurst; beginning previews March 11), in which the titular nineteen-thirties cartoon Betty boop-a-doops into “reality,” and Marc Shaiman, Scott Wittman, Rick Elice, and Bob Martin’s throwback backstage comedy “Smash” (Imperial; March 11), inspired by the NBC series from 2012 but emerging—Boop-like—into three dimensions. Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren appear in Jason Robert Brown’s time-in-reverse musical, “The Last Five Years” (Hudson; March 18); the revue “Stephen Sondheim’s Old Friends” (Samuel J. Friedman; March 25) stars the tried-and-true divas Bernadette Peters and Lea Salonga; and Adam Guettel and Tina Landau’s 1994 musical, “Floyd Collins” (Vivian Beaumont; March 27), revisits a cave-in from 1925. A take on Gilbert and Sullivan’s 1879 treasure, “Pirates! The Penzance Musical” (Todd Haimes; April 4), cries ahoy; Itamar Moses, Erik Della Penna, and David Yazbek’s musical about a mummified desperado, “Dead Outlaw” (Longacre; April 12), does a do-si-do uptown; and Lisa Loomer, Joy Huerta, and Benjamin Velez set the beloved 2002 film “Real Women Have Curves” (James Earl Jones; April 1) to music. Colman Domingo and Patricia McGregor’s “Lights Out: Nat King Cole” (New York Theatre Workshop; April 23) stars Dulé Hill, and Jonathan Groff plays Bobby Darin in “Just in Time” (Circle in the Square; March 28). Dramas, too, get new life: LaChanze directs Alice Childress’s “Wine in the Wilderness,” from 1969 (Classic Stage; March 6); St. Ann’s Warehouse imports Benedict Andrews’s production of “The Cherry Orchard” (March 26); Awoye Timpo directs Wole Soyinka’s 1958 drama, “The Swamp Dwellers,” for Theatre for a New Audience (Polonsky Shakespeare Center; March 30); and Jack Cummings III revives William Inge’s “Bus Stop” (Classic Stage; May 8). The Wooster Group débuts “Nayatt School Redux” (Performing Garage; March 8), remaking their seminal “Nayatt School,” from 1978. A season of retrospection will necessarily feature men behaving badly: Paul Mescal plays the violent Stanley in “A Streetcar Named Desire” (BAM; Feb 28); Kieran Culkin stars in David Mamet’s vicious “Glengarry Glen Ross” (Palace; March 10); Sarah Snook channels monstrosity, playing every character in “The Picture of Dorian Gray” (Music Box; March 10); and Kimberly Belflower’s “John Proctor Is the Villain” (Booth; March 20) knocks a certain hero off his pedestal. In George Clooney and Grant Heslov’s “Good Night, and Good Luck” (Winter Garden; March 12), Clooney plays Edward R. Murrow, but his antagonist, the red-baiting Joseph McCarthy, appears only via archival footage. For women behaving well, you’ll need to go farther afield. Maryann Plunkett confronts death in Abe Koogler’s exquisite “Deep Blue Sound” (Public; February 25); Crystal Lucas-Perry stars in “The Great Privation (How to flip ten cents into a dollar),” by Nia Akilah Robinson, for Soho Rep (Peter Jay Sharp; in previews); and Deirdre O’Connell graces an evening of four elliptical works by the great Caryl Churchill, “Glass. Kill. What If If Only. Imp.” (Public; April 3). The rest is memoir: Tommy Dorfman stars in Emil Weinstein’s dramatization of the trans rabbi Abby Chava Stein’s autobiography, “Becoming Eve” (Abrons Arts Center; March 19); Ryan J. Haddad talks about falling in love in “Hold Me in the Water” (Playwrights Horizons; April 10); Adil Mansoor’s solo “Amm(i)gone” (Flea; March 13) addresses his family’s homophobia; and Shayok Misha Chowdhury follows “Public Obscenities” with “Rheology” (Bushwick Starr; April 22), an onstage collaboration with his physicist mother.—Helen Shaw If you like blockbusters, some MOMA visits are in order this spring. There are close to two hundred works in “Jack Whitten: The Messenger” (opening March 23), the artist’s first comprehensive retrospective, and—even considering that he painted, drew, and sculpted from the nineteen-sixties to the twenty-tens—they are ridiculously various. Blockbuster No. 2 is “Woven Histories: Textiles and Modern Abstraction” (April 20), in which fibre artists ranging from the early twentieth century (Sonia Delaunay, Hannah Höch) to the present (Igshaan Adams, Rosemarie Trockel) paint a picture of a visual avant-garde that was not, first and foremost, concerned with painting pictures. Another traditionally feminine medium, porcelain, is the star and possible villain of “Monstrous Beauty: A Feminist Revision of Chinoiserie.” The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s new exhibition (March 25) takes a wary view of its own contents, which span half a millennium, arguing that the West acted out its daydreams of a docile Orient one cup-and-saucer at a time. The museum also honors the centennial of the American painter John Singer Sargent’s death, with “Sargent and Paris” (April 27)—another show about racy fantasies of foreignness, in a way. Inevitably, everything is centered on the artist’s early masterpiece, “Portrait of Madame X,” the painting that made French society pant. Yes, it’s in the Met’s permanent collection, but a year without a Sargent exhibition somewhere is like a lovely young heiress without a secure dress strap. The reopening of the Frick Collection, on April 17, following almost five years of renovations, should make everyone pant. There is a host of new goodies to reward us for our patience, including sculptures by the Ukrainian artist Vladimir Kanevsky and a stunning roomful of drawings by Goya, Degas, and others, too fragile for long-term display but on view through the summer, at least. The building’s second floor, previously off limits, will be full of ceramics and Bouchers from now on, much as it was when actual Fricks lived there. A day later and a mile north, the Guggenheim Museum opens “Rashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” a major survey of one of the most intriguing American artists of the past twenty-five years. If you know him, you probably know “The Broken Five,” the huge, howling mosaic inspired by the Central Park Five; if not, it’s here, along with almost ninety of its siblings. By the time you exit, their scrawls and dried-shit textures should be almost as recognizable as the Coca-Cola logo. Another mile north, at El Museo del Barrio, “Candida Alvarez: Circle, Point, Hoop” (April 24) honors the multidisciplinary artist with her first large-scale museum survey. Like Johnson, Alvarez has hopped between figuration, abstraction, and conceptualism; her finest work, though, may be her “Air Paintings,” the ingenious flypapers of acrylic, ink, enamel, and glitter which are incapable of being dull for even one square millimetre. Spring ends with the Morgan Library’s “Arresting Beauty: Julia Margaret Cameron” (May 30), a celebration of the early photographer who lived on the Isle of Wight and, when she was nearing fifty, started taking pictures of her friends. If you were trying to preserve as much of Victorian England as possible and had only one Victorian’s work to help, you could do a lot worse than these images; everybody’s here, from Tennyson to Darwin, looking wistful and profound and utterly unamused. Brood with them all summer long.—Jackson Arn Martha Graham was known for laying bare the inner landscapes of her female protagonists, with psyches as incandescent as hot coals. Several works in Martha Graham Dance Company’s spring season (Joyce Theatre; April 1-13), such as the second act of “Clytemnestra,” “Errand Into the Maze,” and “Frontier,” share this burning intensity. But “Deaths and Entrances” (1943), which the company brings back after a long absence, is a particularly interesting case, a portrait of a woman artist—Emily Brönte, originally danced by Graham herself—who, like Graham, fights to preserve her creative impulse. The dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones, too, probes the vicissitudes of a creative life in “Memory Piece: Mr. Ailey, Alvin . . . the un-Ailey?,” an outgrowth of the Whitney’s recent excitingly multifaceted “Edges of Ailey” exhibit. Jones, still vigorous at seventy-two, moves through space with ferocious intent while conjuring stories from the past: early dance sensations, tense interactions with the legendary Ailey, and clashes with critics who tried to box him in as a Black artist. “Do you require moral fervor from Merce Cunningham?” he asks, still furious at the notion. “Memory Piece” alternates with a new work for the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company that explores the limits of personal freedom, “People, Places & Things.” (New York Live Arts; May 15-24.) A little more than a year ago, New York City Ballet unveiled a work inspired by an image from the Russian invasion of Ukraine—a man holding his dead son’s hand after a missile strike. The ballet, “Solitude,” by Alexei Ratmansky, is by turns surreal, harrowing, and poetic, a surprisingly stark statement for a medium not known for tackling explicitly political topics. The piece returns for City Ballet’s spring season (David H. Koch Theatre; April 22-June 1), in a program that also includes Justin Peck’s newest work for the company, “Mystic Familiar,” an elegant display of dreamy youthfulness with music by Dan Deacon and designs by the artist Eamon Ore-Giron. Also not to be missed is a program of ballets set to the music of Maurice Ravel, including a delicate and stylish pas de deux by George Balanchine, “Sonatine.” Not one for introspection or psychologizing, Twyla Tharp instead brings technical dazzle and musical understanding to the stage at City Center (March 12-16). As usual, there is a new piece, set to Philip Glass’s meandering “Aguas de Amazonia.” But I would place my bets on the older work, “Diabelli” (1998), set to Beethoven’s eponymous piano variations, themselves a feast of invention, wit, and intricacy. This is ideal material for Tharp, whose brain thrives on complexity and minute variations in form. And then there is her energizing effect on dancers, who on this occasion include Renan Cerdeiro, until recently of Miami City Ballet—a classical dancer through and through—and the unstoppable Daisy Jacobson. In recent years, the tap artist Ayodele Casel has turned her mind to Latin jazz, tap history, and the improvisations of Max Roach, but this spring she embraces something new: early hip-hop. “I love the way the music swings,” she says of the as yet untitled show, at the Joyce (May 28-June 8)—and “the way tap dancing and words come together.”—Marina Harss “An aria about an important squirrel” may not be what you’d expect to encounter at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but this is one of the things that Joseph Keckler—an artist of operatic talent and irreverent taste—promises the audience at “A Good Night in the Trauma Garden,” newly commissioned for the lapidary surroundings of the museum’s Petrie Court (May 9-10). Across the park and its springtime buzz, birds, not rodents, feature in “Die Zauberflöte,” opening March 23 at the Metropolitan Opera, though they might be overshadowed by Kathryn Lewek’s famed turn as Queen of the Night. If that’s not enough Mozart, or enough farce, “Le Nozze di Figaro” (opening March 31) is quickly followed on the same stage by Rossini’s prequel, “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (opening April 15), which finds Figaro, the eponymous barber, in his madcap salad days. Fantastic beasts may seem less out of place in the New York Philharmonic’s performance of movie music by John Williams (May 7-9) or, indeed, of a new monodrama called “Orpheus Orchestra Opus Onus,” composed and sung by Kate Soper and conducted by Gustavo Dudamel (May 22-24, 27). At Carnegie Hall, Bernard Labadie, making his final appearance as the conductor of the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, leads that ensemble and La Chapelle de Québec in the “St. John Passion,” the spikier of Bach’s two surviving Easter oratorios (April 10). Music by Shostakovich forms the backbone of a visit by the Boston Symphony, which pairs a symphony apiece with outings from Mitsuko Uchida, playing Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 (April 23) and Yo-Yo Ma, playing Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No. 1 (April 24). The Gateways Festival Orchestra, an ensemble that brings together top players of African descent from around the country, plays symphonies by Dawson and Dvořák, and accompanies J’Nai Bridges, a mezzo-soprano of burnished tones, in a selection of songs and spirituals (April 27). A month later, the pianist Evgeny Kissin convenes another supergroup—Gidon Kremer, Maxim Rysanov, and Gautier Capuçon—for a rare all-in-one performance of Shostakovich’s singular sonatas for violin, viola, and cello (May 28). Elsewhere, the viol player Jordi Savall and his ensemble Hespèrion XXI bring pieces from Renaissance England and Catalonia to the 92nd Street Y (April 11), and the choir Stile Antico honors Palestrina’s five-hundredth anniversary at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin (March 29). BAM mounts “The Threepenny Opera,” Brecht’s savage satire of capitalism on the brink (April 3-6). The Brooklyn Art Song Society’s New Voices Festival, which punctuates the spring, features recent works for the voice, including Juhi Bansal’s “Love, Loss, and Exile,” which sets traditional Pashtun landays, originally sung by Afghan women, to liquid piano-and-cello accompaniment (April 6, May 4, June 1). And, at Roulette, the Palestinian American oud player Simon Shaheen presents a program of music from the Arab world (April 26).—Fergus McIntosh If there was a “peak” in the streaming wars, it was in 2022, when the number of scripted series débuting in a single year reached six hundred—too many shows for anyone to keep track of, let alone watch. Now that the battle is over and the fire hose of content has been dialled back, industry observers and TV lovers alike are left wondering what kind of programming this new era of contraction will bring. If this spring is anything to judge by, the networks’ and the streamers’ favored weapon in the fight for eyeballs is high-concept hooks. Many of the new series in the next few months seem designed for simple yet catchy loglines. Take, for instance, the Jon Hamm vehicle “Your Friends and Neighbors” (April 11), an Apple TV+ drama in which a floundering former finance guy turns to stealing from the homes in his fancy suburban enclave to maintain his life style. Also entering a life of crime are the pampered protagonists of Hulu’s “Deli Boys” (March 6), a pair of Pakistani American brothers who, after their father’s sudden death, discover that the family’s wealth came from a much more unsavory source than its convenience-store empire—and that they might have the grit to take their father’s place. However quickly they get in over their heads, they probably don’t have as much to worry about as the loyal friends in Apple TV+’s “Dope Thief” (March 14). Ridley Scott directs Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in the first episode of a tale in which two small-fry thieves rob a drug den and become the target of a relentless kingpin. On the lighter side, Netflix premières “With Love, Meghan” (March 4)—Meghan Markle’s life-style series about cooking, gardening, and being friends with celebrities—after a two-month delay. For those who prefer a bit more edge to their downtime, there’s “The Studio” (March 26), an Apple TV+ comedy about a recently promoted studio head (played by Seth Rogen) who must sacrifice his cinephile sacred cows at every turn to do his job. Of course, the season’s most anticipated shows are probably the returning favorites. HBO is on the cusp of dominating Sunday nights again with the follow-up season of the hauntingly fungal post-apocalyptic drama “The Last of Us” (April 13), in which a mutant mushroom strain causes mass zombiedom. Sunday mornings, meanwhile, are proverbially soon to be dedicated to the network’s megachurch comedy, “The Righteous Gemstones” (March 9), which comes back for its fourth and final season. Also wrapping up their runs are the “Star Wars” spinoff “Andor” (April 22), on Disney+, and the serial-killer satire-thriller “You” (April 24), on Netflix. Spring will also see two less conventional returns. In Netflix’s “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” (March 12), the comedian hosts a live weekly talk show, which builds on his earlier six-part experiment “Everybody’s in LA.” And in PBS’s “Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light” (March 23), Mark Rylance resumes his celebrated turn as Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII’s devious yet doomed adviser, after a ten-year hiatus. Heavy is the head that wears the crown; heavier still is the heart that loses the king’s favor.—Inkoo Kang Action takes many forms, whether on a grand scale or at arm’s length, in upcoming movies, including “Black Bag” (opening March 14), a spy thriller directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by David Koepp. It stars Cate Blanchett as an intelligence officer accused of espionage and Michael Fassbender as the officer’s husband, a fellow-agent, who is torn between his personal and professional loyalties. The director Barry Levinson’s latest film, “The Alto Knights” (March 21), named for an erstwhile social club in Little Italy, is a gangster drama, written by Nicholas Pileggi, in which Robert De Niro plays the dual role of the real-life nineteen-fifties mobsters Vito Genovese and Frank Costello. Alex Garland, whose 2024 film “Civil War” was a military fantasy, sticks close to history with “Warfare” (April 11), co-written and co-directed by Ray Mendoza, whose experiences as a Navy SEAL during the Iraq War are the basis of the story. Mendoza is also the main character, played by D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, and again does his own stunts, in “Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning” (May 23), directed by Christopher McQuarrie. The supernatural realm dominates some of the most eagerly anticipated new films. “Sinners” (April 18), the director Ryan Coogler’s first film since “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” is set in the South, during the Jim Crow era; Michael B. Jordan plays twin brothers who return to the family’s home town and confront evil in both practical and mystical forms. The octogenarian David Cronenberg’s new horror drama “The Shrouds” (April 18), set in a high-tech near future, stars Vincent Cassel as a widowed scientist who devises a camera and software to observe corpses in their graves and discovers that the system has been hacked for malevolent purposes. “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” (May 9), directed by Kogonada, stars Colin Farrell as a man whose mysteriously equipped car leads him to a woman (Margot Robbie) and takes them on a wondrous road trip. Trouble is all in the family in a varied array of new movies, such as the French thriller “Misericordia” (March 21), directed by Alain Guiraudie. It’s set in a rural village, where a young man (Félix Kysyl) attends the funeral of a baker who’d mentored him, stays with the baker’s widow (Catherine Frot), and comes into conflict with her son (Jean-Baptiste Durand). Tracie Laymon’s first feature, “Bob Trevino Likes It” (March 21), is the quasi-autobiographical story of a woman (Barbie Ferreira) who, in a search for her estranged father (French Stewart), instead connects with another man of the same name (John Leguizamo). Wes Anderson’s new film, “The Phoenician Scheme” (May 30), is tightly under wraps but is described as being about a family and its business; it stars Benicio del Toro as a European tycoon and Mia Threapleton as his daughter, a nun. The teeming cast includes Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Wright, and Hope Davis. Movies themselves are a subject of the season, as in the Chinese director Lou Ye’s “An Unfinished Film” (March 14), a drama about a filmmaker’s effort to complete a long-abandoned project that again stalls because of COVID lockdowns. Duke Johnson’s “The Actor” (March 14), based on a novel by Donald E. Westlake, stars André Holland in the title role of a performer who, after an assault, has amnesia and must rediscover his identity and his art. “Being Maria” (March 21) is a biographical drama, directed by Jessica Palud, about the traumatic experiences endured by the actress Maria Schneider (played by Anamaria Vartolomei) during the shoot of “Last Tango in Paris”; Giuseppe Maggio plays the film’s director, Bernardo Bertolucci; Matt Dillon plays Schneider’s co-star, Marlon Brando.—Richard Brody P.S.

        "title": "PKK declares ceasefire in 40-year conflict with Turkiye: Kurdish media | PKK News | Al Jazeera",
        "text": "Kurdish group calls on Ankara to release jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan, who been held near total isolation since 1999. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has declared it will implement a ceasefire with Turkiye, heeding a call from its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan to disarm, Kurdish media reports. The announcement by the outlawed group, reported by the pro-PKK Firat news agency (ANF) on Saturday, is seen as a major step towards ending a 40-year conflict with the Turkish state. “In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo’s call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today,” the PKK executive committee said in a statement quoted by ANF, referring to Ocalan. “We agree with the content of the call as it is and we say that we will follow and implement it,” the committee said. “None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,” it added. The group said it hoped Ankara would release Ocalan, held in near total isolation since 1999, so he can lead a process of disarmament, adding that the necessary political and democratic conditions need to be established for the process to succeed. The statement did not specifically set a timeline for when the group will disband. On Thursday, Ocalan made a historic call from prison for the party to lay down its arms, dissolve itself and end its decades-long conflict with the Turkish state.   Ocalan, 75, has been imprisoned on the island of Imrali, off Istanbul, since 1999, after being convicted of treason. Despite his incarceration, he continues to wield significant influence over the PKK, which he founded in 1978. A day after, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed Ocalan’s call, describing it as a “historic opportunity” for peace. He said Turkiye would “keep a close watch” to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were “brought to a successful conclusion”. “When the pressure of terrorism and arms is eliminated, the space for politics in democracy will naturally expand,” Erdogan promised. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20 percent of Turkiye’s 85 million people. Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has killed more than 40,000 people. Previous peace efforts with the PKK had ended in failure, most recently in 2015. The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but “for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created” and Ocalan “must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress”. Turkiye’s neighbour, Iraq, has welcomed Ocalan’s call, saying it was “a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region”. The PKK’s presence in Iraq has has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara. The group holds positions in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkiye also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against the Kurdish armed groups.

        "title": "‘Versions of Hell’: Squid Game and S Korea’s historical homeless centres | Investigation News | Al Jazeera",
        "text": "South Korea’s wildly popular Netflix show has brought renewed focus on the country’s history of brutality towards the poor and homeless. Seon-gam Island, South Korea – Two men stand at the entrance to a forest surrounded by tall pine trees on an island south of the capital Seoul. In the middle of the forest there is a large clearing and an excavation site. The words written on a safety notice reveal what this forest hides: “Seon-gam Academy Graveyard Recovery Operation”. Chun Jong-soo and Pak Sung-ki were just boys when they were among thousands cleared off the streets by South Korean authorities for alleged vagrancy, and held for years as inmates at institutions like Seon-gam Academy. Seon-gam island was only accessible by boat when Chun and Pak were first detained in 1965 and 1980, respectively. Fighting to control his trembling voice, Chun says he remembers the burial site now being excavated here. He was among the young detainees forced to bury the bodies of his fellow inmates who died trying to escape. Chun told Al Jazeera how they would recover bodies that washed up on the island’s shores and bury them at this forest cemetery. “It was meant to show us the consequences of trying to escape,” Chun said. “Memories of seeing those bodies still haunt me in my sleep.” Hundreds and possibly thousands died amid the forced labour, violence and sexual abuse that prevailed in the group homes and detention centres – like the Seon-gam Academy – that were established across South Korea during the country’s decades of heavy-handed rule from the 1960s through to the 1980s. Among the most notorious was “Brothers Home”, a so-called welfare centre that was once located in the southern port city of Busan, where thousands were enslaved and abused in a state-sponsored programme to punish vagrants and clear the homeless from South Korea’s streets. While police did most of the seizures, Brothers Home employees were also allowed to patrol the city in trucks to do the kidnapping themselves. Children, people with disabilities, and the homeless were rounded up, detained and forced to work at the home where survivors recounted witnessing people beaten to death by staff or left to die from injuries.   The existence of these brutal institutions in South Korea has come to wider attention as Netflix’s Squid Game gains global attention. Season two of the South Korean drama kicked off late last year by racking up the largest audience ever for the debut of a TV series by the online streaming service. In just three days, the dystopian drama about down-on-their-luck South Koreans playing life-or-death games for a jackpot prize of millions amassed 68 million views. Across social media, the Squid Game hype has been prompted by reports the show was based on the real-life horrors that took place at such places as Brothers Home and Seon-gam Academy. Images purportedly of the Brothers Home have gone viral online, showing eerily similar interiors to the colourful, Escher-esque facility depicted in Squid Game where people compete at children’s games and the losers are killed violently. One Facebook user with more than a million followers shared images of dimly-lit, derelict hallways painted in the TV show’s iconic pink and green. Only later were the photos identified as fakes, generated by AI tools online, according to fact-checking organisations. South Koreans have also criticised comparisons with the TV show, some saying Brothers Home was worse in ways than the fictional island prison of Netflix fame. “Fiction can’t keep up with the horrors of reality,” wrote one South Korean social media user, who said life was “real hell” in the homes compared with that in the TV show game. In 2022, South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, an independent investigative body, confirmed that 657 people died at Brothers Home in Busan between 1975 and 1986. Testimonies from survivors of the home recounted horrific conditions that included intense forced labour, physical assault, systemic sexual abuse and pervasive cruel and degrading treatment. “On paper, these facilities were established out of the need to provide relief to impoverished welfare recipients,” said Ha Geum-chul, an investigator for the commission. Hidden was the true function of such centres, Ha said. “Contrary to their stated goals, the forced detention of welfare recipients against their will, human rights abuses, and forced labour in the centres were vastly problematic,” he said. According to Ha, such centres were part of a “unified system of nationwide vagrancy enforcement and detainee management” established by the Ministry of Interior and enforced by police officers who earned “job rating” points for each child apprehended and admitted. “General arrests gave officers up to three points while an admittance to Brothers Home was worth five points. This suggests that police officers performed excessive crackdowns to improve their job performances,” Ha said. Visiting the site of the Seon-gam Academy with Al Jazeera, Chun told how he was captured by authorities while hanging around Seoul’s train station when he was just 11 years old. “I was on my way to my sister’s house when government officials took me in their van. Afterwards, I rode a boat with 40 other captured inmates when we entered the island,” he said. “Every day, we woke up at 6am, assembled in front of the grounds, and worked in the fields all day. They would only give us lunch after we hauled 25kg (55lbs) of rice,” he recounted. “Even then, lunch only consisted of a fistful amount of rice and salted shrimp.” As for what he remembers most about his nine years at the so-called welfare centre, Chun says everyone was beaten daily for the smallest of offences, such as being too chatty. “They just couldn’t bear to let us be kids,” said Chun, who is now 69 years old. “They made us use our excrement as fertiliser and didn’t even care if someone collapsed from heatstroke. That’s why so many of us dreamed to escape this place at all costs,” he said. Inmates would team up in small groups and devise plans to flee. The young boys would practise swimming in a reservoir on the island in the hope of one day making it to the mainland under their own strength across the sea. Many would die trying to undertake the long swim to the shores of Incheon, or the infamous swamps on the island would drown them in their depths before they got very far, Chun said. Chun told how his wife often asked why he still screams in his sleep. “The trauma is something that I will have to carry with me until I die,” he said. Pak Sung-ki’s time at Seon-gam Academy was shorter than other inmates such as Chun. Yet what he faced at the institution traumatised him for life. “Even if I can forget about the punishment I received at the hands of the government workers, being sexually assaulted has left a permanent dent in me,” he said. Before his time at Seon-gam Academy, Pak lived in a middle-class family. Their home had the only television set in his neighbourhood at the time. But his life took a drastic turn when he was picked up at random by government officials while he walked around downtown Seoul as a 15-year-old. Released from Seon-gam after a year and a half when it was shut down in 1982, Pak was never able to return home. His family, like the families of other inmates, did not know what had happened to him. They filed missing person reports at the police station but he was not found. When Pak was eventually released from Seon-gam, he went to his old house but no one was home as his family had moved. It was only when Pak’s family revisited the police one last time to see if they had any news of their lost son – before they moved to the US – that they heard he was in prison. Pak was reunited with his family for the first time in years, but prison walls now separated them. “After I came out [of Seon-gam], I couldn’t work anywhere as I didn’t have any skills. I didn’t have anywhere to go,” Pak said. “So, I lived on the streets and worked as a paperboy and a scrap man just to make enough to buy food. One day, I got caught trying to steal a plate of food from someone. That became my first time entering prison,” he said. Pak’s family moved to the US shortly after he was reunited with them. He could not follow due to his criminal record and they never were able to fully reconnect as a family. They would live separate lives and only communicate through international phone calls. Pak told how he spent time in and out of prison until he was 45 years old. “I’ve frequently visited the psychiatric hospital,” the now 59-year-old told Al Jazeera, revealing he had tried twice to take his own life. “I’ve only recently found happiness,” he added, telling how he had taken up painting in an effort to “give hope to others”. Several of Chun and Pak’s fellow inmates from the academy have not been so lucky – they have simply gone missing and some have also taken their own lives. The remains of Seon-gam Academy’s welfare centre and its associated buildings are still intact on the island. It is one of the few – if not only – welfare centres from that period in South Korea’s history that plans to restore what is left of its dark past and turn it into a site of commemoration for victims and survivors. Gyeonggi provincial authorities are on board to assist the survivors’ committee in their push for more work to be undertaken on the cemetery excavation site. Work is also under way to transfer what is now a temporary Seon-gam museum to a permanent location, and to restore buildings that once served as what Chun and Pak frequently refer to as a “version of hell”. In one corner of the museum are Pak’s paintings of his time at the academy. Painting now serves as a form of mental and emotional therapy, he said, recounting how he learned to draw through YouTube videos and it had opened a new chapter in his life. “I have a dream now. It’s to draw paintings for kids at youth shelters,” he said, explaining how young people in orphanages and other institutions remind him of himself and how he wants to show them to develop their own artistic skills. For Chun, it has only been four years since he first opened up about his experience at the academy to those closest to him. Now he wants that openness reciprocated. If it was South Korea’s regimes of the past that led Chun, Pak and thousands of other young people to be detained against their will, the brief declaration of martial law in December by South Korea’s current and impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol has brought further misfortune for Soen-gam’s survivors. The political turmoil caused by Yoon forced the cancellation of a planned meeting between the island’s survivors, the country’s minister of the interior and safety and the governor of Gyeonggi Province. “We’re angry and frustrated,” said Chun, who serves as the vice president of the Seon-gam Academy survivors committee. “They were supposed to come here and offer a formal apology in front of the survivors,” he said. “Now, we are still waiting for one.” Author of Between Extermination and Regeneration: A Sociology of Brothers Home Workhouse, Park Hae-nam, a professor at Keimyung University, said there are thematic similarities between Squid Game and the institutions established to imprison the socially and economically marginalised in South Korea. If participants in the fictional Squid Game were tools for entertainment, inmates at South Korea’s welfare centres were “tools for labour”, Park said. “Inmates were not in a condition to talk and socialise with each other, and they were not able to become members of society once they came out of the centres,” he said. “And the fact that a lot of people died in these facilities, that’s something that was also shown in Squid Game,” he added. According to Park, the origins of institutions for the homeless goes back to Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonisation in 1945. “As four million displaced Koreans returned from China and Japan, they started to overpopulate areas in the two major cities – Seoul and Busan. With the start of the Korean War a few years later, even more people crowded cities and started to cause daily disturbances. The country just didn’t have the infrastructure to accommodate such a big population,” Park explained. “Newspapers in the 1950s were full of voices that wanted these so-called vagrants taken care of. The government’s answer was to tuck them away somewhere ‘safe’,” he said. With the emergence of Park Chung-hee’s regime in 1963, the Seoul Metropolitan Rehabilitation Centre became the first of these so-called “vagrant asylums”.   The military rule would later sign off on ordinance No. 410 in 1975, which gave authorities the power to send people found on the streets to facilities without an arrest warrant. The initiative was carried out under the banner of “purifying the streets”, Park, the sociology professor, said. “Even if their physical bodies survived, people inside Brothers Home were murdered as members of society,” he said. “They were domesticated and made into beasts so they wouldn’t be able to live like humans [afterwards],” he added. Park said such institutions – whether fictional or historical – symbolise how becoming poor in South Korea “could lead one to extreme misery”. Rather than Brothers Home or the Seon-gam Academy, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk said he was inspired more by dark Japanese manga such as “Battle Royale” and “Liar Game”. Economic class war also underpins his characters in Squid Game, Hwang has said in interviews. “I wanted to show that any ordinary middle-class person in the world we live in today can fall to the bottom of the economic ladder overnight,” he said in 2021. But when Hwang first floated his Squid Game script in 2008, it was rejected on the grounds the story was considered too violent and too unrealistic to be taken seriously. A decade later, when Hwang circulated his script again, the world had apparently changed and his dystopian scenario no longer seemed so outlandish to the decision-makers at Netflix. “The response that I got after 10 years was that it was, in fact, very realistic – that there are probably people playing this game somewhere in the world,” Hwang told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021. “The fact that this story was no longer not realistic, that it was no longer absurd, but that it was something that was very in touch with reality after a decade, it saddened me a little bit as a person, but it also brought me joy as a creator,” he said. The practice of detention without warrants was ramped up under the military rule of President Chun Doo-hwan, who oversaw South Korea’s preparation to host the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics – including rounding up the homeless and beggars. Local prosecutors, however, found in 1987 that only 10 percent of inmates at Brothers Home were in fact homeless. On paper, the people who were sent to “welfare” facilities should have only been detained for a year, after which they had to be released back into society. But most would not be so fortunate, spending many years toiling and living under brutal conditions. Last year, South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission released its first comprehensive report into conditions at the welfare centres. In addition to the estimated 3,100 people that were held inside Brothers Home in Busan, the commission found 5,000 people who were known to have been kept inside four other major facilities. But the actual number of such facilities set up across the country and their total population has still to be fully determined. In the case of Seoul Metropolitan Rehabilitation Centre, which was active for over two decades, according to the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, more than a quarter of its estimated 1,900 residents were found to have died while in detention. On Seon-gam Island, the commission undertook a second recovery operation in 2023 at the forest graveyard. The search uncovered 210 human teeth and remnants of 27 items of personal effects. Most of the bodies that were buried in the forest had decayed, leaving little behind. Most were children under the age of 15. And while the official number of bodies recovered so far has come to a total of 24, former inmates such as Chun and Pak believe that figure will climb much higher as excavations continue. “There are even bodies buried in deeper parts of the mountain,” Pak said. “More than 400 bodies may be uncovered by the time excavation efforts are finished,” he said. “Our fellow inmates have been confined in these small graves for more than 50 years. I’m counting down the days until all the bodies are uncovered so I can comfort their souls and pray for them.” Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "World reacts after Donald Trump, JD Vance berate Ukraine’s Zelenskyy | Donald Trump News | Al Jazeera",
        "text": "Trump wrote on social media that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not ‘ready for peace if America is involved’. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s meeting with United States President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, ended abruptly after the two leaders clashed in a heated exchange over Russia’s war against Kyiv. At the Oval Office on Friday, Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy for being “disrespectful” and not thanking the US enough for its support. “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people,” Trump shouted. “You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country.” Zelenskyy, who was meeting with Trump to convince him not to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and discuss possible US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, told Trump that there would be “no compromises with a killer on our territory”. As the Ukrainian leader left the White House shortly after the verbal match, Trump took to the Truth Social social media app, which he owns, to write that Zelenskyy was not “ready for peace if America is involved”. “He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,” he added. Zelenskyy posted on X after the meeting to thank the US for its support. “Thank you POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he wrote. Here is how some world leaders reacted to the heated dispute: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Zelenskyy to prioritise a rare earth minerals deal over security guarantees or a ceasefire with Russia. “I talked to Zelenskyy this morning – don’t take the bait. President Trump was in a very good mood last night,” Graham said outside the White House. A vocal Ukraine supporter and Trump ally, Graham called the meeting an “utter disaster” and questioned future US dealings with Zelenskyy. “I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,” he said, adding that the Ukrainian president should apologise to Trump or for Ukraine to “get someone new” to lead the country. Top Democratic leaders condemned Trump’s handling of the talks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused him of doing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “dirty work”, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the exchange “appalling”. “The United States must not reward Russian aggression,” Jeffries said. “We should stand with Ukraine until victory is won.” Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, wrote on Telegram that Trump had given Ukraine a “strong slap on the wrist”. “For the first time, Trump told the cocaine clown the truth to his face: The Kyiv regime is playing with the Third World War. And the ungrateful pig received a strong slap on the wrist from the owners of the pigsty. This is useful. But it’s not enough – we must stop military aid to the Nazi machine,” said Medvedev, who is also a former Russian president. Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also praised Trump for showing “restraint” with the Ukrainian leader, whom she called a “scumbag”. “I think Zelenskyy’s biggest lie of all his lies was his assertion in the White House that the Kyiv regime in 2022 was alone, without support,” she wrote on Telegram. “How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint.” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted a message of solidarity with Zelenskyy, writing on X: “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless.” The bloc’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, meanwhile, said it was clear that “the free world needs a new leader.” “Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,” she said in a social media post. “We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back [against] the aggressor,” she added. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.” European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and European Council President António Costa praised Zelenskyy, saying his “dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people”. They added: “Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone.” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Portugal that Russia is the “aggressor” in the Ukraine war and Ukrainians are the “aggressed people”. “I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. We, that is the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others,” Macron said. “And we must thank all those who have helped and respect those who have been fighting since the beginning. Because they are fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children and the security of Europe. These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these, that’s all,” he added. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, “Ukraine can rely on Germany and on Europe.” “No one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine! That is why we are jointly seeking the path to a lasting and just peace,” he said. Friedrich Merz, expected to be Germany’s next chancellor, addressed Zelenskyy on X, stating: “We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.” Johann Wadephul, a top legislator from incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s party, also backed Ukraine. “The scenes from the White House are shocking,” he wrote on X. “How can you stab the president of an invaded country in the back like this? Free Europe will not betray Ukraine!” Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with both Trump and Zelenskyy following their public fallout. According to a Downing Street statement, Starmer said he is looking forward to “hosting international leaders on Sunday, including President Zelenskyy”. “He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine,” the statement said. Prime Minister Micheal Martin said Ireland stands with Ukraine, recalling his visits to the country: “When I met with President Zelenskyy yesterday, I reiterated our full support for a just, durable and sustained peace.” Foreign Minister Simon Harris stressed that Ukraine is not responsible for the war, stating: “Ukraine is not to blame for this war brought about by Russia’s illegal invasion. We stand with Ukraine.”   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will continue to stand with Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace. “Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,” he wrote on X. Foreign Minister Melanie Joly encouraged NATO allies to band together “amidst all this unpredictability and sometimes even chaos”. “We believe in supporting Ukraine. Our position has not changed. We think Ukrainians are fighting for their own freedoms, but they’re also fighting for ours,” she said. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere condemned the events in the White House as “serious and disheartening”. “Ukraine still needs the US’s support, and Ukraine’s security and future are also important to the US and to Europe. “President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has strong support in Ukraine, broad support in Europe, and he has led his people through a very demanding and brutal time, under attack from Russia. That Trump accuses Zelenskyy of gambling with World War III is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from,” he said in a statement to Norwegian TV2. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen described recent events as a setback for Kyiv. Writing on Facebook, he said, “It’s a punch in the gut for Ukraine. … There must be room for robust conversations – even between friends. But when it happens in front of rolling cameras like that, there is only one winner. And he sits in the Kremlin.” Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X: “Sweden stands with Ukraine. You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s. Slava Ukraini!” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo reaffirmed Finland’s commitment to Ukraine, pledging “our unwavering support and work towards a just and lasting peace”. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp reiterated his backing for Ukraine, saying he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha. “I reiterated my full support for Ukraine: whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” he said. Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: “Dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also expressed solidarity with Ukraine. “Ukraine, Spain stands with you,” he wrote on X. Prime Minister Luis Montenegro assured: “Ukraine can always count on Portugal.” Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni proposed a meeting between the US and European leaders to reaffirm their bonds. “A summit without delay is needed between the United States, European states and their allies to talk frankly about how we intend to tackle today’s major challenges, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years,” Meloni, a right-wing leader, said in a statement. Her deputy meanwhile expressed support for Trump. “Aim for PEACE, stop this war! Come on @realDonaldTrump”, Matteo Salvini wrote on X. Prime Minister Viktor Orban was among the few voices in Europe that backed Trump. “Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace,” he wrote on X. “Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!” Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna wrote on X that the only obstacle to peace was President Putin’s “decision to continue his war of aggression”. “If Russia stops fighting, there will be no war. If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine. Estonia’s support to Ukraine remains unwavering. Time for Europe to step up,” Tsahkna wrote. President Gitanas Nauseda expressed solidarity, writing: “Ukraine, you’ll never walk alone.” Prime Minister Evika Silina reaffirmed her country’s support, saying Latvia stands with Ukraine. President Petr Pavel wrote on X: “We stand with Ukraine more than ever. Time for Europe to step up its efforts.” Prime Minister Petr Fiala declared: “We stand with Ukraine and on the side of the free world.” President Natasa Pirc Musar condemned the events in the Oval Office, warning they undermined international law and diplomacy. “We stand firmly in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty. We repeat, Russia is the aggressor. It is time for Europe to take the lead on the path to peace in Ukraine,” wrote Musar on X. President Maia Sandu wrote on X: “The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine defends its freedom – and ours. We stand with Ukraine.” Prime Minister Luc Frieden assured Ukraine of his country’s support, saying: “You are fighting for your freedom and a rules-based international order.” Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said Croatia understands Ukraine’s struggle, noting: “Croatia knows from its own experience that only a just peace can last.” He added that Ukraine needs a peace that guarantees “sovereignty, territorial integrity and a secure Europe”. Romania’s interim President Ilie Bolojan stressed Ukraine’s importance to European security, stating: “The security of Ukraine is crucial for the security of Europe. We all need to stand together to fight for our values, freedom, and peace.” Austria’s caretaker Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, while the country’s foreign ministry declared: “Russia is the aggressor and we share Ukraine’s commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace!” Prime Minister Bart De Wever pledged solidarity with Ukraine, stating: “We stand behind Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their historic fight to defend themselves against an unprovoked Russian aggression. Their fight is our fight. United we are strong.” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement: “We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, because this is the struggle of a democratic nation versus an authoritarian regime led by Vladimir Putin, who clearly has imperialistic designs, not just on Ukraine, but throughout that region.” Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said his country remains “steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself in a war that Russia started”, adding that Ukraine is not only protecting its sovereignty but also upholding international law. Amnesty International stressed that peace in Ukraine must be built on justice for those responsible for war crimes. “Nothing that was said today in the Oval Office changes the facts: Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was an act of aggression and a manifest violation of the UN Charter,” the rights group said in a social media post. It added that “sustainable peace in Ukraine is only possible through justice and accountability for all crimes under international law committed since 2014.” Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "title": "Bosnia peace envoy says Serb regional leaders seek to destabilise country | Courts News | Al Jazeera",
        "text": "Christian Schmidt calls for the ‘immediate cessation of all activities that undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement’. The international high representative for Bosnia has accused the political leaders of the autonomous Serb region of seeking to destabilise the country, after the statelet passed legislation to bar the Bosnian national police and judiciary. Lawmakers in Republika Srpska, the country’s autonomous Serb republic, approved the legislation on Thursday after a state court banned its separatist leader Milorad Dodik from politics for six years and sentenced him to a year in prison for refusing to comply with decisions made by the high representative, Christian Schmidt. The separatist gambit could trigger a constitutional crisis in ethnically divided post-war Bosnia. Schmidt, who is tasked with overseeing the Dayton Accords that ended the 1992-95 intercommunal war between Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniak Muslims that killed more than 100,000 people, accused the political leaders of the autonomous region of undermining the state. The Dayton Accords split Bosnia into two autonomous regions: a Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska. A weak central government connects these regions under the high representative, who holds significant powers, including the ability to fire political leaders. Schmidt on Friday called for the “immediate cessation of all activities that undermine the Dayton Peace Agreement and the constitutional and legal order of Bosnia and Herzegovina,” according to a handout from his office. “These actions by the ruling coalition in Republika Srpska seek to destabilise the institutions exercising constitutional responsibilities of the State,” the statement added.   Dodik was indicted in 2023 after he signed legislation suspending the rulings of Bosnia’s constitutional court and Schmidt, thereby breaching the peace agreement. Dodik, who has long called for the region to break away and form a union with neighbouring Serbia, rejected the court ruling and urged lawmakers in the autonomous Serb republic to vote to ban the state police and judiciary. “We think this creates momentum for us to do this without the use of force,” Dodik said, adding that the region aims to roll back reforms and create a state judiciary, police, and military to counter secessionist tendencies. After Thursday’s vote, Bosnian Serb parliamentary speaker Nenad Stevandic said that 49 of the 52 deputies in the assembly supported the legislation. However, the prime minister of Bosnia’s Muslim-Croat region, Nermin Niksic, slammed Dodik’s push to ban the country’s institutions on Friday. “I am not ready to participate in any talks or discuss continuing political cooperation with the institutions of Republika Srpska until all these actions against the constitution, the Dayton peace agreement, and the state are stopped and annulled,” said Niksic on social media. The Bosnian Muslim member of the tripartite presidency, Denis Becirovic, also condemned Dodik and Republika Srpska officials, saying their moves were an “attack on the country’s constitutional order”.

        "text": "﻿Also: More on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. ﻿Also: More on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. by  Alex Heath For the last couple years, it has been evident that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is back in the building. This week, he sent a clear message to hundreds of employees in Google’s DeepMind AI division, known as GDM: the pressure to win the AGI race is on. “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM,” begins his note, which The New York Times first reported on yesterday and I’m publishing below in full. “We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts.” Brin goes on to recommend that Google’s AI teams work longer hours (“60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity”), come into the office “at least every week day,” prioritize “simple solutions” to problems, and generally move faster (“can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python”). What stuck out the most to me was his last point: that Google’s AI products “are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds.” According to Brin, Google needs to “trust our users” and “can’t keep building nanny products.” While his note was intended for a small audience of AI researchers at DeepMind and not all of Google, it’s still remarkable in a couple of ways. For one, it came from Brin, who technically has no formal role these days besides being a board member, and not Demis Hassabis, who runs Google DeepMind. As some employees have poined out to me, there’s also irony in Brin recommending that employees work 12-hour days when he and co-founder Larry Page arguably left Google rudderless when they retired in 2019 — just before this AI boom cycle began in earnest. Finally, it’s telling that Brin, who attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration with CEO Sundar Pichai, is now using his power to seemingly push for removing Gemini’s guardrails. You can read Brin’s full note to Gemini researchers below: “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM. We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts. Code matters most — AGI will happen with takeoff, when the Al improves itself. Probably initially it will be with a lot of human help so the most important is our code performance. Furthermore this needs to work on our own 1p code. We have to be the most efficient coder and Al scientists in the world by using our own Al. Productivity — In my experience about 60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity. Some folks put in a lot more but can burn out or lose creativity. A number of folks work less than 60 hours and a small number put in the bare minimum to get by. This last group is not only unproductive but also can be highly demoralizing to everyone else. Location — It is important to work in the office because physically being together is far more effective for communication than gve etc. And, therefore you need to be physically colocated with others working on the same thing. We need to minimize reporting lines across countries, cities, and buildings. I recommend being in the office at least every week day. Organization — We need to have clear responsibility and organization with high functioning groups with shared management and technology leadership. Simplicity — Lets use simple solutions where we can. Eg if prompting works, just do that, don’t posttrain a separate model. No unnecessary technical complexities (such as lora). Ideally we will truly have one recipe and one model which can simply be prompted for different uses. Excellence — whether it’s an eval or a data source or a dashboard or a message in an internal Ul, please make sure they all work and all are good. Speed — we need our products, models, internal tools to be fast. Can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python on borg. Iterate at small scale — we need lots of ideas that we can test quickly. The best way to do this is small scale experiments until you can ramp up and hopefully see increasing advantage at scale. This is an excellent validation. Working too much at just large scale has a habit of minor tweaking and overfitting to evals, checkpoint sniping, etc. We need real wins that scale. No punting — we can’t keep building nanny products. Our products are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds. We need capable products and [to] trust our users.“ By now, most employees at Meta have probably seen my story about the company firing around 20 employees for leaking. (A special thanks to the communications team for widely sharing it on Workplace!) Cracking down on leaks is nothing new for Meta, though leadership does seem highly motivated to snuff out this recent wave. Moments after my story was published yesterday, CTO Andrew Bosworth addressed the firings during a company all-hands meeting that was, yes, leaked to me. After joking about how chairs had been rearranged in the room to make the all-hands look more well attended than it actually was, here’s what he had to say about leaks: “There are three different types of leaks. A lot of times there are accidental leaks, people who are just being casual [and] clumsy with information. They’re trying to share it to a friend, a housemate, their mom, and they’re not paying attention to what they’re doing. The second kind is people who are trying to be helpful. ‘If only the press understood this one thing, then they would surely tell a good story about us.’ They won’t. And then there’s malicious leaks, antagonistic leaks, people who are trying to push an agenda that they hold and they think is more important to them than the company. All three of those leaks are fireable offenses. All three of them. And we take them seriously. We have a team dedicated to identifying these leaks. And so we did conduct a bunch of investigations and we fired more than 20 people for leaking in the last couple of weeks. More than 20. That’s not the entirety of the list. There’s quite a few more investigations that are proceeding right now. So, just to remind everybody, don’t be screenshotting stuff, don’t be recording stuff. We are getting pretty good at finding these things and those people aren’t here anymore… We just have zero tolerance. It doesn’t matter what the excuse is. It doesn’t matter how innocuous you think it was. We just fire those people. Okay. Great. Fun. Boy, we’re really off to a great roll. Nobody’s here. We fired people… And they wonder why they gave me the Q&A.” If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line and all of our reporting.

        "title": "Misun Woo on Women’s Rights in the Asia-Pacific – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific “We need to ask why there hasn’t been much change to advance women’s human rights and end injustice?” In September 1995, following the United Nations’ Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China, a declaration was issued proclaiming, among other things, that “women’s rights are human rights.” The resulting resolution identified 12 “critical areas of concern,” ranging from “The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women” to unequal access to education, violence against women to “Inequality between men and women in the sharing of power and decision-making at all levels.” Nearly 30 years later, as Misun Woo – the regional coordinator of Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) – told The Diplomat’s Managing Editor Catherine Putz in the following interview, women continue to face many of the exact same challenges. “We need to ask why there hasn’t been much change to advance women’s human rights and end injustice?” Woo stressed. In the following interview, Woo highlights the interconnected nature of these challenges. It’s not just the patriarchy; other “structural causes of marginalization and inequality” – like globalization, climate change, various fundamentalisms, and militarism – are behind the stagnation in women’s rights and human rights more generally. In the years ahead, Woo says, “it will be critical for feminist and women’s rights movements, especially with Global South feminist leadership, to articulate solutions, reclaim ways of living and being that have been lost due to various forms of domination and oppression, and connect these stories and solutions both vertically and horizontally so that we can concretely co-imagine and build a new future.” In talking with APWLD’s many members and partners across Asia, are there common themes in regard to the challenges women face? Women across Asia and the Pacific face numerous forms of human rights violations and discrimination. These include sexual and gender-based violence, deepening poverty and economic exploitation – where the current global economy continues to extract women’s (cheap) labor, especially in unpaid/underpaid care labor and the gender pay gap – weak political representation and leadership power, and widening inequalities and lack of access to education and health. The debt crisis and privatization deepen these barriers, while the climate crisis and intensifying pushback against feminist and women’s human rights movements exacerbate these challenges. The worst part of this story is that these ongoing challenges faced by women aren’t new. For instance, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995) addressed the same concerns through its 12 critical areas of concerns. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action; the 25th anniversary of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325, which commits member states to support women’s participation and leadership in peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction; and the 10th anniversary of the COP21 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, for most women in Asia and the Pacific, this year will most likely be a year of mourning as there has not been much change to the rights violations, injustice, discrimination, or inequalities they face. We need to ask why there hasn’t been much change to advance women’s human rights and end injustice? The answer is clear. It’s because structural causes of marginalization and inequality remain unaddressed. Causes are complex and interrelated, and hence require long-term strategies and cross-movement pressure to change. APWLD’s analysis focuses on the fusion of patriarchy with systems that routinely undermine women’s human rights: globalization, fundamentalisms, and militarism, and how colonialism and imperialism continue to manifest in these interconnected systems of oppression. Through countless conversations and space creation, we learn there are some common challenges women face in Asia and the Pacific region. These common challenges are not working in silo but are deeply structural with compounded intergenerational consequences on women’s human rights.

        "title": "Funding Freedom in China: Time for Private Donors to Step Up – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Many Chinese civil society organizations became reliant on now-frozen U.S. government aid after funding from private U.S. organizations dried up. Even before the Trump administration’s suspension of U.S. government funding for democracy and human rights projects as part of its freeze on foreign assistance, the American philanthropic sector had already largely abandoned the cause of human rights and democratic reform in China. In the 1990s, the Ford Foundation had a robust program supporting civil society, civil and criminal legal reform, and marginalized communities in China but has since moved away from a strong rights-based focus. As part of a reorganization, the Open Society Foundations has shifted its work to thematic areas as opposed to doubling down on closed societies, such as China. This retreat comes at a time when Xi Jinping’s rule is marked by growing repression and totalitarian rule that extends beyond China’s borders as PRC agents intimidate and harass activists and ordinary citizens in the United States and other countries. Because of the private philanthropic sector’s neglect, the U.S. government’s funding suspension is causing a crisis among groups working to nurture political reform, with some civil society groups in China at risk of extinction. Private foundations and philanthropic institutions are missing an opportunity to support China’s human rights defenders, independent religious groups (such as unregistered house churches), bloggers calling for democratic reform, independent media, and ethnic minority groups, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. Even foundations with missions that would be well-served by a focus on promoting an independent civil society as well as democratic and accountable governance in China neglect the crucial need to foster political liberalization. For example, the Gates Foundation, which focuses primarily on health inequity and poverty in China, has shied away from addressing the foundational role that accountable and transparent governance plays in implementing sound public health policies and delivering sustainable development. Instead, they fund projects that support parts of the Chinese government’s efforts to spread its international influence, such as a $1.6 million project for Tsinghua University to “establish a center of excellence for advocacy communications in global health and global development.” This kind of approach not only risks supporting China’s global sway, including spreading authoritarian governance practices, but it also forgets the Chinese government’s efforts to squelch early warnings of the virus that would become known as COVID-19. In one poignant example, Dr. Li Wenliang, who was brought in for questioning after warning a private chat group about an emerging virus in Wuhan, ended up dying from the disease. Failing to support democratic values in China will end up harming U.S. interests. The Chinese party-state under Xi Jinping has become increasingly antagonistic toward the United States despite U.S. support for economic development and the inclusion of the PRC in the international community ever since the late 1970s. This animosity has even been expressed by Xi himself; in 2023, he stated that “Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way.” The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is also hostile toward democratic ideals. CCP Document No. 9, a leaked party directive, warned that ideas such as “the separation of three powers, a multiparty system, a system of universal suffrage, independent judiciary, [and] a military belonging to the nation” are all threats to the CCP regime. Nurturing respect for human rights and democratic reform in China aligns with U.S. national interests and long-standing U.S. values.  The U.S. intelligence community’s annual threat assessment names China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea – all authoritarian states – as specific threats to U.S. national security. The PRC government benefits from censoring dissident voices and controlling the media because it allows them to malign the U.S. and distort the United States’ role in the world. Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan understood the necessity of supporting dissidents behind the Iron Curtain and promoting democratic ideals as an important Cold War policy tool. It was under his tenure that the United States established the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a nonpartisan grant-making institution. The impact of this kind of proactive and pragmatic funding is confirmed by the International Center for Nonviolent Conflict’s research, which finds that training and educating activists in closed societies, especially in non-violent resistance, results in more lasting and successful democratic breakthroughs. Yet the NED’s congressional appropriation is facing scrutiny under the new administration. Instead of tackling dictatorial rule in China, the American philanthropic sector has adopted a fatalistic approach that assumes political reform is not possible or that their only option is to collaborate with the Chinese government. This pessimism does not consider the historical record, where democratic breakthroughs were often preceded by times of despair where political liberalization seemed unlikely. Private foundations and philanthropic organizations should pivot and put financial backing behind civil society groups working to combat PRC repression, including the detention and imprisonment of human rights lawyers, house church pastors, and ethnic Uyghurs and Tibetans. The investment needed to support this work is manageable for many deep-pocketed philanthropic actors, as a budget of even $5 million by a handful of donors would do much to sustain this work. This is not an impossible task: the Ford Foundation’s annual budget for China is $12 million annually and the Gates Foundation has pledged $50 million over five years for a Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, a collaboration between the Beijing Municipal Government and Tsinghua University. As it stands, the American philanthropic sector is missing important opportunities to fund independent voices and courageous political activism.  For example, veteran reporter Vivian Wu, who started the media outlet Dasheng (meaning “mighty voice”) seeks to get independent news to Chinese citizens. As sources of funding have dwindled, Wu, who previously worked for BBC, uses personal savings to fund her analysis and posts on social media and YouTube. Her case is not unique. Civil society groups that were already operating on shoestring budgets now face the risk of folding because of the suspension of U.S. foreign assistance. Some of these groups played a crucial role in bringing to light not only egregious violations of Uyghur rights, including the forced sterilization of women in detention camps, but also the use of forced labor for Chinese exports emerging from the Uyghur region. Even if the U.S. government decides to permanently reduce foreign assistance, the American private sector can work to realize Reagan’s vision that the country should be a “city upon a hill” and Woodrow Wilson’s declaration that America “should make the world safe for democracy.” Before he died in police custody, Nobel Peace Prize Winner Liu Xiaobo expressed this view when he wrote, “I have viewed the West as if it were not only the salvation of China but also the natural and ultimate destination of all humanity.” If the government and private donors both fail to rise to the occasion, it will represent an abdication of responsibility not only to U.S. citizens, but to those overseas who look to the United States for inspiration and hope.

        "title": "Bandit Rule: Pakistan’s Burning Domestic Security Issue – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific It’s not just terrorism and militancy – criminal gangs are a serious problem in parts of Sindh and Punjab. Pakistan faces a range of internal and external security challenges. While there has been significant concern regarding the ongoing law-and-order situation due to continuous terrorist attacks, the country also grapples with an internal security issue: banditry (known locally as dacoity). Bandit rule, or Daku Raj, is particularly notorious in northern Sindh Province and southern Punjab Province. Over the years, bandit rule has taken hold in the riverine belt commonly known as the Kacha area. This region spans three districts in Sindh – Kashmore, Ghotki, and Shikarpur – and extends into Southern Punjab, covering Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan. The river network in the area was formed as a result of changes made to the irrigation system by British colonial rule in the early 20th century. Previously resembling irrigation plains, the area was transformed by the irrigation system in the lower Indus region, particularly below Kot Mithan in South Punjab. Now it suffers from regular flooding during the monsoon season. In the summer, the Indus River overflows its banks. In contrast, during the winter, the river shrinks to a thin stream, leaving both banks dry. This land is utilized for cultivation. The recurring floods have left the Kacha area devoid of proper infrastructure, making it difficult for the general public to access. This region has thus become a natural hideout for bandits. Since the 1980s, bandit rule has been firmly established along the riverine belt. There are rumors, especially in Sindh, that during the era of military dictator General Zia ul Haq, the government intentionally sheltered these bandits in the Kacha area. This move was intended to weaken the Pakistan People’s Party in Sindh, particularly after the successful “Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.” Since then, bandit rule in the area has never been completely eradicated, despite many operations by law enforcement agencies. Bandits have become infamous for conducting raids to plunder, commit murders, and kidnap people before disappearing into their shelters established along the river. Today, the bandits are equipped with modern weaponry – reportedly including weapons left behind by the United States during its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan – which makes it more difficult to carry out a successful clearance operation. A police officer told The Express Tribune, the bandits “have better weapons than ours [the police force’s] and this is the ground reality… The bandits have mortars, RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] and anti-aircraft guns. The weapons they possess can even blow up an armoured vehicle.” Due to their increasing notoriety, residents of the districts in the Kacha area habitually restrict their movements after sunset, only leaving their homes for emergencies. People from neighboring districts avoid unnecessary travel to these areas, even during the daytime. There is a growing fear of being mugged or even kidnapped at any time of day. These bandits often target Hindus – not only for kidnapping for ransom but also for extortion in the form of “protection money,” as many members of this minority community are traders by profession. The bandits obtain lists of affluent individuals within the Hindu business community from local intermediaries, then they issue extortion demands accompanied by deadlines and threats if the demanded amounts are not paid on time. Typically, those targeted feel compelled to comply with the demands, fearing for their safety. Bandits have also been known to set “honey traps,” which involves using women to lure men. Once the targets arrive, the bandits kidnap them and hold them for ransom. Despite public warnings from the police, many men still fall victim to these schemes. With the increasing prevalence of social media across Pakistan, bandits often record videos of their victims – often in poor health with visible injuries – to pressure their families into arranging the ransom without involving law enforcement agencies. The gangs torture the victims so that they appeal to their families to pay the demanded amount to their kidnappers. These videos often go viral on the different social media platforms, which signals that they are not only meant for victims’ families – the intent is spreading fear among the masses, particularly in but not limited to the areas surrounding the riverine belt along the Indus. As part of this psychological campaign, the bandits have also taken to social media to make fun of authorities. They launched their own YouTube channel to openly mock law enforcement agencies for their ineptitude. Bandit gangs also have a presence on other platforms including Facebook and TikTok, where they frequently post content pertaining to social injustices. Posts often criticize the “feudal system” in Pakistan, which the bandits claim compelled them to take up weapons. Bandit rule has become notorious over the decades, instilling a permanent fear in the minds of people in Pakistan. Although there have been periods of peace, Pakistan is in the middle of an upsurge in such criminal activity. There is an urgent need for effective police operations against the bandits; however, it is often alleged that these criminals are supported by local influential figures, including political leaders and police officials. Putting an end to bandit rule in the Kacha area will require not only political willpower but also a strategic approach to ensure a long-term peace.

        "title": "What’s Missing From Australia’s Gender Equality Strategy? – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific The male backlash to female empowerment is a locally and globally destabilizing force and should be directly addressed. In early February, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released its new International Gender Equality Strategy. The strategy is designed to target Australia’s development assistance toward improving the conditions for women and girls – with an understanding that societies faring better in the treatment of women tend to also have lower levels of poverty, autocracy, corruption, instability, and civil unrest. Yet there is a caveat. For international development policies aimed at improving the conditions of women and girls to produce long-term positive results, there is a need to recognize that the agency and advancement of women and girls doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The lasting success of these initiatives often relies on nullifying or minimizing men’s resentment toward women’s agency and advancement – or ideally gaining men’s support. This is not to say that women and girls need the permission of men to advance – or need to develop policy that placates men’s negative impulses – but it’s necessary to recognize that the male backlash to female empowerment is a locally and globally destabilizing force. Women’s gains don’t come at the expense of men, yet many men think or feel they do – and this is a major social and political problem. As I’ve noted previously, there is evidence from Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, India, and Rwanda that women’s agency and advancement increases the risk of men’s violence against them. This, of course, is not confined to the developing world, as the same phenomenon is present in Australia itself, as well as other wealthy, developed, countries. Australia’s international development policies therefore need to take this dynamic into consideration. The new Gender Equality Strategy fails to seriously address this phenomenon, with no references to masculinity at all. Although there are some initiatives aimed at countering gender-based violence and harmful stereotypes, this is distinct from having a deeper understanding of men’s psychology and how to advance agency and opportunity for women and girls without inflaming men’s resentment. So how can Australia invest in the advancement of women and girls through its international development policies while simultaneously bringing men along with this advancement? Key to this is understanding some key instincts within masculinity. Men’s need for status is persistent, but malleable. Therefore, policy should recognize that there is an opportunity for men to gain pride and purpose from the advancement of women and girls – to be champions of this themselves. While women invest their capabilities and resources back into their communities in ways that men usually don’t, given the right psychological incentives men could also do so – but it requires working with men’s tendencies and impulses. Men have a need for purpose and a sense of social recognition for their achievements. Alongside this, masculinity maintains tribal instincts toward community protection and group advancement. When excluded – as many men feel today – these inclinations can instead turn chaotic and hostile. As a result, men seek their emotional and prideful rewards through interpersonal violence, misogyny, and aggressive political movements. To recognize this is to also recognize an opportunity for the Australian government to think about how development policies that empower women and girls can also provide men with a sense of community pride and advancement. Men’s instincts regarding purpose and protection can be directed toward doing the job of neutralizing the negative impulses within masculinity. Give men the responsibility to build the positive capabilities of their own menfolk – and their required sense of social achievement that would flow from this. Australia’s new International Gender Equality Strategy repeatedly states that “gender equality benefits everyone.” This is true, but it has to move beyond being a slogan. Slogans often have a counter-effect when used in lieu of real-world outcomes. They can rankle people and lead to a backlash against the ideas being advanced. This is the persistent problem of modern progressive politics, and one that can filter up from activism into state policy. For gender equality to benefit everyone men need to recognize this within practical, everyday outcomes. They need to see these benefits as aligning with their own sense of purpose and pride and feel that they are also advancing alongside women and girls. The lesson of recent decades is that when women and girls gain freedom and opportunity, they tend to thrive. Women have character and resilience in abundance, and have been storing it up for millennia to utilize within the modern world. However, men struggle without social reinforcement. It may be that Australia’s future international gender equality strategies may not need to be focused on the agency and opportunity for women and girls at all, but instead be focused on enhancing men’s emotional maturity, and encouraging men to develop the same character and resilience as women.

        "title": "Philippine Exit from Money-laundering ‘Grey List’ Marred by Allegations of Abuse   – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Human rights groups have accused the Philippine authorities of using money laundering and terrorist financing laws to clamp down on legitimate dissent. Philippine authorities celebrated the country’s removal last week from the money-laundering “grey list” of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), but some civil society groups described it as a “Pyrrhic victory” because of the filing of trumped-up terrorism financing cases against activists and community-based organizations. The Philippine government has worked hard to comply with the standards set by FATF to improve the local financial system. Aside from forming an inter-agency task force, it teamed up with the private banking sector to address the concerns raised by FATF. News of the removal of the Philippines from the “grey list” was immediately welcomed by government officials. The House Speaker said it would lead to the removal of “burdensome restrictions,” reduction of transaction costs, and allow financial flows to move more efficiently. He added that overseas Filipino workers, who make up a tenth of the country’s population, stand to benefit because their hard-earned remittances will now be processed faster and with lower fees. A senator cited the permanent banning of the Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) as a good decision since this industry is notorious for being a hub of criminal operations. The finance secretary said that the improved financial governance will allow the Philippines to “attract more foreign direct investments and expand more trade partnerships.” But human rights advocates pointed out that the measures enforced by the Philippine government led to the weaponization of the FATF standards to suppress dissent and undermine the work of people’s organizations at the grassroots. The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) flagged the surge in “fabricated” terrorism financing cases, “arbitrary” asset freezes, and instances of financial exclusion targeting civil society leaders and organizations. For instance, there were only 14 terrorism financing cases in 2023 but this went up to 66 in 2024. Bank accounts of at least 17 non-governmental organizations have been frozen. Among the accused were groups and their networks engaged in human rights and disaster-preparedness training, agrarian reform advocacy, environmental protection, and the delivery of humanitarian and development aid in conflict areas. The freezing of accounts resulted in the non-delivery of crucial services and capacity-building activities for poor rural and indigenous communities. NUPL said the overbroad measures initiated by the government represented “a concession to an unjust global financial order.” It also belittled the Philippines’ exit from the “grey list” of the FATF.  “This so-called achievement has been built on a foundation of political repression,” it said in a statement. NUPL compared the aggressive filing of cases against activists and development workers with the perceived reluctance to pursue charges against the backers of POGOs who are linked to money-laundering operations involving billions of pesos. “The state’s eagerness to prosecute trumped-up charges of financing terrorism while ignoring financial crimes committed by politically connected elites exposes the hypocrisy of this so-called victory,” NUPL said. Human rights group Karapatan highlighted that the heavy-handed approach of authorities “preys on people’s organizations critical of the misdeeds of government and development NGOs that provide services for poor communities.” For example, an investigative media report featured a police order linking the FATF compliance with the filing of a case against an activist. Human Rights Watch urged FATF to engage with civil society. “FATF should not stay silent while the government is misusing its terrorism financing recommendations to harass civil society groups and activists,” it said in a statement. FATF did not directly address these concerns but its country report reminded the Philippine government that measures should be “appropriately applied” and that they should neither discourage nor disrupt legitimate activities of people’s organizations. It remains to be seen whether the FATF decision will actually lead to the upgrading of the country’s financial status or if the government will reconsider the terrorism financing cases it filed against development workers and people’s organizations. It is a timely reminder that standards imposed by global institutions could have broad consequences, and sometimes governments can wield these policies to roll out a different agenda with serious ramifications on the people’s civil liberties and well-being.

        "title": "A Shot Across the Bow: China Signals New Era of Sea Power in the Southwest Pacific – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific The live-fire exercises were a demonstration of China’s growing sea power in Australia and New Zealand’s immediate periphery – and meant to normalize the PLA presence there. The People’s Liberation Army Navy Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang during its deployment in the Southeast Pacific, Feb. 11, 2025. Over two days last week, Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Naval Task Group 107 launched live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea without any warning to the Australian or New Zealand governments. The exercises were directly under the flight path of one of the busiest routes across the Tasman, a peaceful body of water far from China. As a precaution, for three days all flights across the Tasman were diverted to avoid the firing zone. The live-fire exercises were a display to show that China’s military forces could cut off the air and sea links between Australia and New Zealand at any time, with no warning. China’s aggressive act is a shot across the bow to New Zealand and Australia, but also to the countries of the wider Pacific. It is a demonstration of China’s growing sea power in the Southwest Pacific and meant to normalize the PLA presence there. The PLAN live-fire exercises were not merely a tit-for-tat response to Australia or New Zealand’s periodic freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, as some commentators have claimed. They were designed to send the message loud and clear that China wants to rule the waves in the Pacific and to force Australia and New Zealand to accept the new normal. In essence, China is challenging the existing strategic setup. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping calls the new China-centered maritime order he wants to impose a “community of oceanic destiny.” China is now gaslighting the governments of Australia and New Zealand about the live-fire exercises and presence of an uninvited, hostile naval presence in their near seas. The Global Times, a CCP-owned tabloid paper aimed at foreign audiences, singled out Australia for overreacting, at the same time as telling New Zealand and Australia to get used to the regular presence of the PLA in their region. China often singles out Australia for criticism, while taking a softer public line on New Zealand, as Chinese officials have frequently claimed that New Zealand’s relationship with China is a model for other Western governments. It is a divide-and-rule tactic, which more than a few New Zealand governments have fallen for in the past. A Show of Force The CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily revealed that the task force – consisting of the Zunyi, a Type 055 stealth guided-missile destroyer; the Hengyang, a Type 054A guided-missile frigate; and Weishanshu, a Type 903 replenishment ship – incorporated both naval and air forces, which were in the area to undertake “training exercises on the high seas” and “blue-water drills” in the Pacific. The authorization to conduct such an exercise would have come from Xi, who leads the CCP’s Central Military Commission. Other Chinese media sources acknowledged that the transit of the naval force and live-fire exercises were intended to signal the beginning of the “normalization of the deployment” of PLA forces in the South Pacific. Military vessels are entitled to innocent passage, even in the territorial seas of other states, as long as their transit is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state. There is no international law that regulates military vessels conducting live-fire exercises in international waters, but it is the norm to alert nearby states in advance so they can take preventative action. China is using these international rules as a shield for what can only be interpreted as an act of intimidation: extra slow transits of a naval group in the EEZs of the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Australia, as well as live-fire drills that disrupted New Zealand and Australian air traffic. After the live-fire exercise, the PLAN Naval Task Group 107 spent several days in the Tasman Sea, moving in the direction of New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The ships have now changed course and are back in the Australian EEZ, heading south toward Tasmania. Based on the current trajectory, they seem likely to traverse Tasmania’s South East Cape and head up along Australia’s western flank into the Indian Ocean before they return to China. A map from Chinese outlet Tencent News shows the past and projected course of the PLAN’s Naval Task Group 107. Chinese naval analysts noted back in 2007 that Australia’s South East Cape provides a useful alternative route for Chinese vessels. The PLAN Task Force Group’s itinerary is a deliberate poke in the eye to Australia’s north-focused security strategy, which has long over-invested in defense capabilities in Australia’s northern approaches, while relying on New Zealand’s depleted naval forces to protect the Tasman, and France to periodically patrol Southern Australian waters. PLAN Naval Task Group 107 has now gone farther south than any PLA naval flotilla since 1985, when two aged PLAN vessels travelled through the Pacific and on to the Southern Ocean, delivering a team of scientists to set up China’s first Antarctic base on King George Island. During that voyage, the PLAN’s first ever blue water expedition, one of the two vessels broke down en route. The current trip demonstrates that China now has a complete, fully self-sufficient blue water logistics support chain. This is a major breakthrough in PLAN sea power. The group of ships have transited 800 kilometers, coming via the Philippine’s Busilan Strait, passing through Papua New Guinea (PNG) waters and the Coral Sea, and on to Australia’ Eastern coast. They travelled along Australia’s Eastern coast for 10 days before the live fire exercises were launched. China now has the world’s largest navy, with 234 vessels to the U.S. Navy’s 219. The U.S. fleet is dated, and it would take decades to ramp up production. China clearly has the capacity to rival U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific. Combined, Australia’s and New Zealand’s naval fleets consist of only 12 vessels. Since 2024, China has also been using its People’s Armed Police Force Coast Guard vessels to establish a regular gray-zone presence across the Western, Central and North Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention Area – in other words the whole of the Pacific. China’s maritime security forces are legally allowed to board any foreign fishing vessels on the high seas in the first, second, and third island chains. China now has the third-largest marine security presence in the Pacific, and all of these vessels would be under the PLA’s command in a time of war. China is preparing to station a permanent presence in the Southwest Pacific and wants the other military powers of the Pacific – Australia, New Zealand, France, the United States – to know there is nothing they can do about it. The PLAN has demonstrated over several years that it is blue-water capable. China has built dual-use port and airport facilities in Vanuatu and the Solomons, with more planned in Kiribati and the Cook Islands. Options for Australia and New Zealand The Australian and New Zealand governments are in an awkward position when it comes to responding to China’s show of force. Both have military cooperation agreements with China. There has been a steady build-up of PLAN and PLA Air Force visits to New Zealand and Australia over 20 years, many of them facilitated and encouraged by the Australian and New Zealand governments as part of their military diplomacy and security relationship with China. In both 2013, and 2017, a PLAN Task Force Group, consisting of two frigates and a supply vessel, was hosted in Auckland harbor. The Hengyang 54a, which is part of the current PLAN Task Force Group 107 traversing the Tasman, was on the 2017 visit to New Zealand. In 2016 and 2019, PLAN vessels conducted training exercises in New Zealand’s internal waters. In 2013, Australia hosted a PLAN frigate as part of an international naval exercise. In 2019, a three-vessel PLAN task force were hosted in Sydney harbor for three days; they traversed Australia’s Indian Ocean flank and South East Cape to get there. Both Australia and New Zealand’s defense relationship with China has cooled in response to Xi Jinping’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy. The list of concerns about China’s behavior is long. Along with China’s actions, another unexpected development has been worrying to observe: there has been a chilling silence from the White House about China’s live-fire exercises in the Tasman. Under the ANZUS Treaty, the United States is obligated to defend Australia if it comes under attack. The U.S. suspended New Zealand from ANZUS after the passing of New Zealand’s 1987 anti-nuclear legislation, which barred U.S. nuclear–powered vessels from port calls in the country. In a plot twist, though, on the afternoon of February 25, a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Minnesota, appeared in Western Australia for a regular port visit. Australia military personnel told journalists that the PLAN Naval Task Group 107 would likely have had nuclear-powered submarine support for some of its voyage. Even so, Australia and New Zealand have appeared very isolated in the last few days. Now is the time to reach out to other like-minded small and medium powers who also rely on the rules-based international order for their security, and to invest significantly in defense capabilities. We have entered a dangerous new era. The events of the last week will be looked back on as a turning point for the Southwest Pacific. It is a moment of truth for Australian and New Zealand political leaders, as their naïve and foolish engagement policies and under-investment in defense are being exposed. The actions the two governments take in response will be crucial to the Pacific’s long-term security.

        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific The series has come under scrutiny for its depiction of Thai culture, but are critics just missing the point? The official poster for the third season of HBO’s “The White Lotus.” Few recent TV shows have been more hotly anticipated than season three of HBO’s “The White Lotus,” written and directed by Mike White and set this time in Thailand’s Koh Samui. Season three of the smash hit premiered on February 16 but, so far, the beloved show has already garnered criticism for its take on Thailand, including its sepia color correction, underuse of Thai characters, and stereotypes about Thailand. For those who have not yet watched seasons one and two of the show, the premise always unfolds thus: a group of out-of-touch wealthy Western tourists stay at fictional White Lotus resorts across the globe where an unidentified dead body has been discovered. Over the course of the ensuing episodes, the tourists are lampooned for their tone deaf approach to their local surroundings, as viewers try to solve a traditional whodunit from the cast of mostly white and upper class characters. Seasons one and two were shot in Hawaii and Sicily, respectively, but the series’ jump to Thailand has now provided the opportunity for a stark examination of how Western audiences view Southeast Asia. Orientalism is ever-present from the opening credits and monkeys, actually macaques, feature prominently in both animal and statue form. Everyone is obsessed with the monkeys, which they mostly think are cute and exotic,  although one character has the foresight to mention that they can be aggressive, foreshadowing that Southeast Asia is a continent of smiles but one where danger lurks beneath the surface. In another scene in the opening episode, one of the characters is terrified to discover a monitor lizard slithering about the high end resort. Later, she hears something rustling in the trees at nighttime, causing her to flee to the safety of her room. Dangerous and brooding animals lurk everywhere in Southeast Asia, it seems, and they upset foreigners. The way Thailand is depicted in “The White Lotus” was criticized as far back as last year when the trailer was released, and caused controversy for seemingly using what has been described as a “third world country yellow filter.” “This is not the first time Hollywood has used warm yellow color grading to depict foreign locales such as India, Mexico and Iran. Color grading is a post-production technique used to alter the color tones of a work,” Singapore’s The Straits Times wrote at the time. “This longstanding trope was evident in crime drama series Breaking Bad (2008 to 2013), in which scenes set in Mexico or New Mexico had a yellow and orange tint.” It added, “The Netflix action film Extraction (2020), set in Bangladesh and starring Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, faced similar backlash for its heavy use of yellow tones. Even the first season of The White Lotus depicted Hawaii with a noticeably yellow tint.” In cinematic terms, the West is clean, bright, and white, while the “third world” is dirty, yellow, and backward. At around the same time that the “The White Lotus” trailer aired, Apple was similarly panned for releasing a sepia-colored advertisement for its phones that suggested that Thailand was dirty, unsafe and underdeveloped – and filled with people who don’t speak English. It is not just cinema, or Thailand, that suffers from Orientalism, a concept satirically tackled by British travel writer Tim Hannigan in a 2012 article in New Matilda entitled “How to write about Indonesia.” “Indonesians do not have Facebook accounts. They enjoy cockfights and have an intimate connection to the world of spirits,” he wrote. “There must be a volcano. This is a good way to create a title for your book about Indonesia. Between the Volcanoes, Beneath the Volcano, Inside the Volcano – these all work. The volcano is a symbol of how Indonesia is exotic, mysterious, and threatening. Putting it in the title of your book will convey this very clearly.” Back at “The White Lotus,” Thailand is similarly mysterious and threatening, and also sexually deviant. In addition to creepy animals, there are ladyboys and massages with “happy endings” and everyone adheres to an unknowable religion called “Boodhism,” which one character remarks is for Chinese people. In the opening scene of episode one, another character refers to a statue of the Buddha as “mother******.” One of the main reasons why “The White Lotus” was so hotly anticipated in Southeast Asia was due to the casting of Lalisa Manoban from the k-pop group Blackpink, in her first acting role as resort employee Mook. Mercifully, Mook speaks to her coworkers in Thai, which should feel like common sense, were it not for the hundreds of TV shows and films where local characters have been forced to speak English to one another lest anyone watching have to read subtitles. Yet despite the casting of Thai actors, there have already been criticisms that their Thai characters are mere sub-plot devices, with the BBC’s Caryn James describing season three as “flabby and elongated,” where Manoban’s character has “little to do except smile and flirt with the security guard at the resort’s entrance.” Similar commentary has been made by others, including a piece in The Conversation entitled “HBO’s White Lotus Does Thailand Dirty.” “There is a clear cultural, economic, and racial split presented, one that fails to allow any Thai character the ability to air their criticisms of the guests or to be developed in a meaningful way. In the main, the focus is on whiteness – a criticism previous series have also garnered,” lecturer Andrew Russell wrote. But perhaps this is the point? The entire thrust of “The White Lotus” to date has been to laugh at rich people who are unable to laugh at themselves, and who are out of their depth anywhere other than their immediate environments. As we watch the characters flounder around on Koh Samui – marveling at monkeys and mangling the Thai language while trying to order room service, perhaps we are only meant to see Thailand through their eyes rather than expect a serious and nuanced depiction of the country. With that in mind, is the criticism of Thailand’s “The White Lotus” and its overt Orientalism justified, or are we just failing to see the obvious joke?

        "title": "The Quantum Tech Race Is Heating Up – The Diplomat",
        "text": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific With the U.S. and China each boasting new breakthroughs, the real-world application of quantum computing is moving closer – with major implications for national security. The year 2024 ended with a new frontier in the global tech race of quantum supremacy. The United States and China each announced ground-breaking advancements in quantum computing with the development of Willow and Tianyan-504, respectively. As these tech rivals push the boundaries of quantum computing, the critical question arises: what new possibilities will this unlock for real-world-applications of quantum computing, and what will national security look like in the quantum-driven future? In computing, speed is a critical benchmark that determines computational power. Currently, the fastest classical supercomputer processes and stores information using binary bits (0 or 1). In contrast, quantum computers are based on qubits that can exist in a superposition of states – and can be 1 or 0 at the same time. This property enables quantum computers to run multidimensional quantum algorithms, accelerating their speed and defining their computational superiority over classical computers. However, the dilemma of quantum computing is that by increasing the number of qubits for computational power there is also a corresponding rise in errors. The makers of the Willow chip, produced by Google, claim that they have reduced the error rate with an increase in qubits, thus addressing the quantum computing dilemma. Willow has demonstrated its superiority in random computer sampling (RCS), a test designed to prove that a quantum computer can perform computations better than any advanced classical computer. In this test, Willow surpassed the world’s fastest supercomputers by a jaw-dropping extent: according to its creators, Willow “performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion… years – a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe.” Meanwhile, China Telecom Quantum Group (CTQG), the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, and QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. jointly reached their own breakthrough with the Tianyan-504. China’s superconducting quantum computer has set a new domestic record by surpassing the 500 qubits threshold. Additionally, it “matches international standards in key performance metrics such as qubit lifetime and readout fidelity,” a yardstick to measure the reliability of a quantum system to read out the information stored in a qubit. These developments could lead to significant progress in quantum computing for real-world applications like financial modelling, machine learning, and manufacturing industries. However, they could also have implications for national security. For instance, quantum computers have the potential to decrypt current global encryption systems that protect military, financial, and governmental data. If any state achieves this decryption capability, it could gain access to highly classified information from other states, potentially disrupting their intelligence operations or financial transactions, thus compromising national security. For example, the United States can use the Willow chip, with its error reduction capability and exceptional computational speed, to develop a quantum computer that is capable of breaking standard encryption codes. Considering this potential threat from quantum computers, China has already adopted a two-pronged strategy: making strategic investments in a quest for quantum supremacy while pre-emptively securing its system from future quantum-driven cyberattacks. For instance, in 2016, China launched a quantum communications satellite, Micius, to protect its communications. Moreover, it has created a 12,000 km quantum communication network, leveraging quantum key distribution (QKD) to create theoretically unbreakable encryption. Now China could further upgrade Tianyan-504 to create advanced cryptographic systems to secure its classified communications. This shows the dual application of quantum encryption for offensive and defensive purposes. The growing interest of other countries – like Russia, the United Kingdom, and India – in quantum technology also highlights its significance. For instance, India’s heavy investment in the National Quantum Mission (NQM) reflects its growing drive to develop a quantum-based cyber ecosystem. Russia is also competing in this quantum race, having launched its first 50-qubit quantum computer. Pakistan too has launched a foundational initiative for research and development, the National Center for Quantum Computing (NCQ). The fast-paced development of Willow and Tianyan-504 indicate the urgency with which states are developing quantum computers capable of decrypting current global encryption codes and developing cryptographic systems. In this quantum-driven future, states need to formulate a model that can not only focus on applications of quantum technology but also take pre-emptive measures to secure classified data from quantum based cyberattacks.

        "text": "Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Raihan Sarah Nabilla Follow -- Share Salah satu kegiatan yang saya sukai ketika jalan pagi adalah people watching! Bukan cuma buat olahraga, tapi juga buat nikmati suasana. Sambil menghirup udara segar, saya suka mengamati orang-orang dengan aktivitas paginya. Tanpa sadar, kita tuh ternyata saling terhubung ya? Saya yang sedang jalan pagi. Ada sepasang lansia yang sedang jalan pagi juga. Seorang ayah yang sedang membonceng anak perempuan berseragam merah putih. Petugas kebersihan yang duduk sambil bercengkrama sambil tertawa di samping gundukan daun kering yang telah mereka kumpulkan. Pengemudi ojek online yang mengantarkan penumpang dengan motor matic-nya. Ada angkot yang sedang ngetem di sisi jalan. Keluarga kecil yang sedang bersepeda bersama. Ibu penjual surabi yang sedang melayani pelanggan, sementara anaknya memasak adonan surabi yang baru. Semuanya terlihat seperti rutinitas biasa, tetapi di situlah keindahannya. Meski dengan kehidupannya masing-masing, setiap orang tetap menjadi bagian dari lanskap kehidupan orang lain. Bagaikan teka-teki yang terlihat acak, tetapi setiap bagian memiliki perannya sendiri. Mengingatkan saya pada lirik lagu RM yang berjudul Moonchild bahwa kita adalah bagian dari pemandangan satu sama lain. Saling melengkapi dan memberi makna. We are each other’s nightscape, each other’s moon Kita adalah pelengkap kehidupan satu sama lain. Lansia yang sedang jalan pagi, ayah yang sedang mengantarkan anaknya ke sekolah, dan keluarga kecil itu mungkin tidak menyadari bahwa ada seseorang yang sedang mengamati dan menikmati momen itu sebagai sesuatu yang berarti. Pengemudi ojek online, supir taksi, dan ibu penjual surabi mungkin sedang fokus mencari nafkah, tapi bagi orang lain, mereka merupakan bagian dari ritme kota yang terus berjalan. Para petugas kebersihan yang duduk bercengkrama sambil tertawa saat bekerja itu juga menunjukkan bahwa terdapat kebahagiaan kecil dalam rutinitas yang terlihat biasa. Saya mengamati aktivitas mereka saat jalan pagi, tetapi bagi mereka, mungkin saya hanyalah bagian kecil dari rutinitas yang sedang mereka jalani. Hanya seorang yang sedang berjalan kaki yang bahkan mereka pun mungkin tidak menyadari keberadaan saya. Dan mereka beserta aktivitas paginya juga menjadi pelengkap bagi saya. Pagi itu menjadi bermakna ketika saya menyadari bahwa tanpa keberadaan mereka, aktivitas jalan pagi saya tidak akan menjadi semenyenangkan itu. Seperti lukisan pemandangan malam yang indah di kejauhan, kehidupan pun tampak harmonis jika hanya dilihat dari permukaannya. Siluet pepohonan yang terlihat samar di bawah sinar bulan, kabut tipis yang menggantung di udara, jalanan perkotaan yang sibuk, remang-remang merah dan putih di jalan, bangunan tinggi yang menjulang, dan lampu jalan yang berpendar. Namun, saat lukisan itu dilihat dari dekat, goresan lukisan — setiap individu — memiliki cerita atau maknanya sendiri. Di balik kegiatan pagi yang terlihat harmonis, saya sadar bahwa ada banyak hal yang tidak terlihat. Kita hanya melihat seseorang berjalan, bekerja, atau bercengkrama, tapi mungkin di dalam dirinya terdapat beban yang tidak ditunjukkan kepada siapa pun. Sama seperti saya yang tidak hanya sebagai pengamat, saya juga merupakan bagian dari pemandangan malam ini dan sama-sama memiliki cerita yang hanya saya ketahui. Did you know? That streetlamp also has many thorns Take a close look at that flickering light Isn’t a night scenery such a cruel thing A splendid view unfolded before us that is made up of someone’s thorns Someone else will surely be comforted by looking at your thorns Thorns atau duri pada lampu jalan melambangkan rasa sakit, luka, kesedihan, perjuangan, beban, atau kesulitan seseorang. Tiap-tiap dari kita pasti memiliki perjuangan yang tidak terlihat. Bisa saja orang-orang yang keluar rumah di pagi hari itu sedang berusaha untuk menjadi hidup, tidak hanya sekedar menjalankan rutinitasnya saja, sehingga pemandangan indah ini terbentuk dari rasa sakit, beban, dan perjuangan tersebut. Lucu ya, malah jadi sebuah paradoks. Itulah mengapa pemandangan malam merupakan hal yang kejam. Seperti lampu jalan yang tetap berpendar meski memiliki duri, kita pun tetap berjalan meskipun membawa beban masing-masing. Justru karena masing-masing dari kita memiliki duri, kita bisa saling memahami. Duri itu menjadi jembatan bagi kita untuk saling mengerti, mendukung, dan memberi ruang untuk bercerita. Kadang, tanpa kita sadari, melihat orang lain sedang berjuang bisa memberi kita kekuatan. Ada kenyamanan dan perasaan lega saat mengetahui bahwa kita tidak sendirian. Saat saya mengamati pemandangan pagi itu, saya merasa hidup. Mungkin karena di balik rutinitas yang biasa, terdapat cerita yang tidak terucap. Dan mungkin dengan menyadari bahwa kita saling terhubung, kita bisa menemukan makna dalam hal-hal yang sederhana. -- -- Hello! Welcome to a glimpse of my train of thought.

        "text": "Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story zeeshan sharif Follow -- 1 Share Mobile telephones are indeed the very much part of our lives, without which even a day cannot pass. They have replaced several items like watches, calendars, cameras, and alarms. Just an object will tell you the time, remember, take photographs, and even give alarms. Life is much easier for anyone, yes, even turned easy for the phone. But more and more probably these phones have become their most useful time consumers, as it has consumed most people today. Busy people spend hours on their phones and forget to have a chat with their parents and friends. Online chatting or streaming videos became more attractive than going out with people. It just leaves spaces for loved ones and slowly takes a toll on their real-life relationships. The very important thing now is how those mobiles are used. They should very much help us in many ways but should not replace family and friends. Limit screen time to gain real conversations. Quality time with people should standardize the meaning and joy in life. In brief, mobile phones can be very helpful, but not at the expense of important people in our lives. We should put technology into perspective alongside real relationships, so Friends and family should never be far from memory. How do you make sure that your mobile phone does not create ruptures in relations for you?? -- -- 1 Listener ,Writer, amphil, scholar(Phy), reader,teacher, treveller, natural lover.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The reliable knot that pulls together the threads of basic human life in America is beginning to unravel, and there suddenly arises the possibility that the center will not hold. Spencertown, NY—We are having February storms like the snows we used to have. At the Hudson Valley farm where I live, sheets of ice cover the driveway and are broken up with salt on the roads—now freezing again and buried beneath a foot of soft white fluff that will harden up, making everything inaccessible. Staying home is a gamble. To stay home is to risk being stranded in an isolated farmhouse without power for days. Everything stops. We worked with this for years, moving into the kitchen where there is a wood stove, lighting kerosene lamps and candles to read by at night, dreading the onset of the dark, figuring out what food can be prepared with only low heat and how to get through the day with the necessary coffee and tea without boiling water. Cleaning anything without running water (having only a limited amount of water stored in jars in the house) is a project. The rest of the house is freezing. Going beyond the kitchen door to haul up firewood from the basement with a flashlight, keeping the wood stove going by feeding it hour after hour through the night, is hard work. Blackouts like this come on suddenly, and they end suddenly. Meanwhile, every minute there is tension: You are waiting it out… and the moment the lights come back on you forget the whole thing—you have the luxury of forgetting the whole thing. But it brings back the reality that you live in a country that works, where you expect to have running water, the roads to be plowed, to get out and get around, to be able at any moment to get enough to eat, to be safe inside, and outside too, and to have a surround of people who share those core beliefs. You can differ in opinion—but you share the reality that you live in a country that works, and where you know that this is just a brief pause in the machinery. But we now live in a moment and in a country where suddenly people everywhere—like the vast collection of animals we are—turn their eyes to the center. Where there suddenly arises the possibility that the center will not hold—that the reliable knot that pulls together all the threads of basic human life in America is beginning to unravel and that the country may cease to work. The familiar basic human needs of food and water and shelter and safety and a working system of roads may no longer be met. What we think of as readily available and solid as the ground beneath our feet may no longer be there. And things will die. And people will die. What is the old adage? “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” Don’t play with the way things are—you’ll break the underlying system, evolved over years and years, that holds it all together. Don’t mess around with the “off” switch. How can you play with a mechanism as complicated as the United States without breaking it? The storms are a kind of freezing in time. Moments to pause and think about how to let the wheel of America keep turning and not let it stop, not let it simply break in the hands of people who may be—like many of us—too comfortable, and too ignorant of history to know why the imbalance of too much power in one place is not the American thing. No one should have the strength to crush the lives of others without their having recourse in America today. It is the story of Samson, the story of shams, the sun, whose locks, whose rays, are shorn by Delilah, confusion. Without its rays the sun becomes blind; it cannot shine and see what is before it. The sun was once what turned the wheel, bound to the very axis at the center of the temple that is the world. When, in the end, the blinded sun cannot move, it falls, pulling down the roof, killing everyone.

        "title": "A Half Century of Failure to Reform the FBI Has Gifted Patel With Alarming Power | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Fifty years ago, lawmakers started lifting the lid on the shocking abuses of the new Bureau chief’s most famous predecessor. The trouble is, very little changed. When Kash Patel is confirmed this week as FBI director, he’ll go to work in a building that bears the name of J. Edgar Hoover, who headed the agency and its forerunner under eight presidents. To anyone who has grown up on Mars—as Elon Musk hopes people will in years to come—this might seem extraordinary. After all, a Senate investigation of US intelligence agencies—established on January 27, 1975—found that Hoover had orchestrated lawbreaking on an industrial scale for decades, causing people to lose their jobs, their liberty, and, in some cases, their lives. On the face of it, President Trump has given Patel a brief to prevent the FBI from being “weaponized to persecute political opponents.” But don’t expect “political opponents” to mean progressive movements. Trump has already made clear his intent to clamp down on Palestine solidarity action with an executive order giving every department and agency of the federal government 60 days to “identify all civil and criminal authorities or actions…that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism.” Hoover would have relished the task, judging by what Senator Frank Church and his committee discovered when they lifted the lid on the FBI activities in 1975. Their report, published the following year, was a blockbuster running to 2,679 pages. It had been produced in the face of stiff resistance from Hoover’s successor Clarence Kelley, who had refused to cooperate for six months, causing “great difficulties” for Frederick Schwarz, the inquiry’s chief counsel. When agreement was finally reached to give the Church Committee access to FBI files, Schwarz discovered that “substantial numbers of relevant, highly pertinent and sensitive Bureau documents” had been destroyed after Hoover’s death in 1972. What Church exposed was nonetheless truly remarkable. The final report revealed that the FBI had engaged not only in highly intrusive domestic surveillance but also in illegal break-ins, smear campaigns and covert operations, known as COINTELPRO, to disrupt groups deemed “subversive.” Among its findings were: FBI mass surveillance failed, however, to discover much that was actually unlawful. From a sample of 675 cases, Schwartz’s team found that only seven prosecutions were initiated—of which just four led to convictions. Hoover’s abuses did, however, have an enormous human impact through other channels. As subsequent academic studies have revealed, the intelligence the FBI generated was used, both officially and illicitly, in multiple other ways with devastating consequences for tens of thousands of people. According to David Caute in The Great Fear, FBI investigations led to 2,700 civilian dismissals and 12,000 resignations from government jobs under the Federal Loyalty Program and to the denial of clearance for 5,312 people under the Industrial Personnel Security Program. Seth Rosenfeld, author of Subversives, says that the FBI’s secret “Responsibilities Program” planted derogatory information anonymously on at least 908 people, more than half of whom were fired or forced out of academic and local government jobs. As for the House un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), a University of Chicago study found that the intelligence provided by the FBI was used as ammunition in 172 hearings at which 3,079 witnesses placed into the public record 16,700 names of “misbehavers” most of whom were then blacklisted in some way. Witnesses who refused to cooperate with HUAC would often be convicted of contempt of Congress and jailed. Across those targeted in different ways, hundreds ultimately suffered periods of incarceration—for contempt, for proxy offences unrelated to their political views, or using the 1940 Smith Act outlawing advocating the forcible overthrow of the government, under which 145 people were indicted, of whom 108 were convicted and sentenced to a total of 418 years in prison. These US-wide developments were mirrored at a local level. In nearly every state, there were mini-HUACs, Smith Act replicas, oaths of allegiance, and blacklists. California’s Un-American Activities Committee, for example, published 15 reports and named in them some 20,000 people and organizations during its 30-year existence. In New York City, Caute says, the sustained purge of schools and colleges throughout the 1950s ended up ousting an estimated 379 teachers from their jobs. A central issue facing Church was whether to ban the FBI from investigating “ideas or associations” completely. In a hearing on December 11, 1975, committee member Walter Mondale argued that such investigations should happen only by exception and “under the severest and most closely defined standards,” adding: “If we fail to do that, I am convinced that this committee has failed and that in another 50 years, there will be hearings just like this in which the excesses that we have uncovered will have been repeated.” How right he was. Nearly all of Church’s 96 recommendations have been either ditched, diluted or defied. The Smith Act has not been repealed. New guidelines requiring the FBI to have “specific and articulable facts” concerning possible violence before targeting a political group were replaced as early as 1983 by a requirement only to have a “reasonable indication” of such a threat and have been watered down even further since. A recommendation that judicial warrants must be obtained for surveillance, which led to Congress passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, mutated into a secret court nodding through virtually every request, including bulk authorizations since the act was amended in 2008. Meanwhile, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence—established in response to Church’s call for “intensified” congressional oversight—has proven hopelessly ineffective in living up to its brief. Sasha Abramsky Dave Zirin Elie Mystal Branko Marcetic While the Church Committee’s exposure of past abuses was historic, the harsh reality is that it failed to produce a fundamental change in the modus operandi of US intelligence agencies. The FBI did not even make cosmetic changes. Not only is its headquarters still named after Hoover; its website has a tribute to his third in command, Cartha De Loach, who continued to work for the agency as a consultant after the Church inquiry and was hailed when he died in 2013 by the then–FBI Director Robert Mueller as someone who upheld the agency’s “highest ideals.” At the heart of the problem is the question of whom the intelligence agencies deem “subversive” to the interests they serve. In the decade following Church, the FBI targeted groups campaigning against US military intervention in Central America. The American Civil Liberties Union discovered in 2008 that the FBI had been targeting anti-war groups such as the Thomas Merton Center and United for Peace and Justice. In recent years, it has mounted surveillance and covert operations against racial justice activists. Now pro-Palestine protesters are top of the list. To make matters worse, the FBI now has 38,000 staff, compared to the 4,602 at the height of the witch hunt in 1950—and access to technology beyond Hoover’s wildest dreams. While Washington politicians worry about this force being weaponized against each other, the real issue for progressives is whether it is being used for repression of dissent. The lesson from Hoover’s era is the classic adage that we must not stand by while they come for people whose views we don’t wholly or even partially share. Hoover may have started with communists—but social democrats and liberals soon found themselves caught in his net. It was not until the latter stages of the witch hunt that opposition to it took on a mass character, as happened with protests against HUAC hearings in San Juan in 1959 and San Francisco in 1960. Those events were the beginning of the end for HUAC, though it would also take a burglary in 1971 by seven brave civil rights activists to expose the way Hoover had turned to covert action as other weapons in his war on progressives were being denied him. Today, we should expect Trump and Patel to act fast and fiercely in cracking down on political dissent. Sadly, liberal failure to fight for the implementation of the Church report has gifted them with an FBI still rooted in the culture of Hoover.

Activate your online access Maybe because its support for students is popular with Republicans as well as Democrats. And because cutting that funding would blow a big hole in the budgets of red states. At her confirmation hearing last week, Linda McMahon, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education, walked a thin line. On the one hand, she needed to assure Congress and the American people that she was fit for a cabinet-level position. On the other, she needed to satisfy her would-be boss, who has said quite candidly that he wants McMahon “to put herself out of a job.” We shouldn’t be surprised, then, that McMahon rejected the notion that she would “defund” education, suggesting instead that she would root out “waste, fraud, and abuse.” That’s a falsehood. But it’s a lie McMahon has to tell because the truth isn’t as popular as the president would like. Today, the Department of Education is the site of our strongest national commitments to equal opportunity for school-age children. This wasn’t always the case. For much of its early history, the US Office of Education, as it was then known, was chiefly tasked with collecting statistics. But as the nation gradually extended the reach of established rights and the range of its assurances to the young, it accumulated a substantial portfolio of education-related protections and provisions. Just in the two decades prior to the elevation of education to a cabinet-level agency, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, the Education Amendments of 1972, and the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (subsequently replaced by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990). These kinds of investments, along with school-based enforcement of laws like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, meant that the federal government was playing an increasingly active role in leveling the playing field for young people. The Department of Education isn’t without its flaws. As Republican critics have claimed over the past several decades, the agency has been the site of federal overreach. Perhaps the most brazen enthusiast of such transgressions was Arne Duncan, Barack Obama’s secretary of education, who used his post to drive through a host of unpopular reforms during his tenure. Such efforts were ill-advised—not merely because they pushed beyond the historical limits of the federal role in a system long characterized by high levels of local control. They also created fodder for conspiracy-minded thinking about the nationalization of education. Though it may seem like ancient history now, the right-wing Tea Party faction used the Common Core State Standards to revitalize its movement after Obama was reelected. Backed by funds from both the Department of Education and the Gates Foundation, “Obamacore” was portrayed as a “nefarious federal plot to wrest control of education from local school systems and parents.” Yet the Department of Education was hardly a partisan project of the Democratic Party. As is often mentioned, Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 legislation that peeled the Office of Education away from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. But the stand-alone Department of Education was established by a congressional act with more than 100 cosponsors in the House and Senate, 26 of whom were Republicans. As members of the 96th Congress described it, the new agency would solidify “the Federal commitment to ensuring access to equal educational opportunity for every individual.” That commitment is what’s under assault right now. And it’s exactly why Trump sees the agency as a “big con job.” Look past the rhetoric and the surface-level activity of the Department of Education and focus, instead, on its budget. Roughly $15 billion each year goes to schools serving low-income students, mostly urban and rural communities. Another $15 billion or so goes to support students with disabilities. And more than $50 billion each year goes to Pell grants and subsidized loans to defray the cost of college. The con job in question is what we once called the welfare state, before that phrase was slandered into obscurity. It’s what allows tens of millions of kids to live and learn in dignity. Donald Trump legally can’t close the Department of Education. But as recent events indicate, the limits of executive authority are going to be tested early and often in this administration. Even if Trump doesn’t force an unconstitutional cessation of agency operations, he will almost certainly kneecap it by firing staff and slashing its budget. Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency has already cut roughly $1 billion in education grants and contracts. And Trump has suggested that he’ll transform any remaining federal spending on education into block grants—funds that can be spent on virtually anything, including projects that would undermine the strength and stability of public schools. His January 29 executive order, “Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunities for Families,” directs states to use Department of Education block grant funding for private school vouchers and other forms of school choice. The law, alone, isn’t going to restrain Donald Trump. Nor are the facts. But Trump fancies himself a populist, and the myriad contradictions in his views can often be explained by his tendency to seek approval from his supporters. Inasmuch as that is the case, saving the Department of Education, if it can be done at all, will require convincing ordinary Republicans that they have something to lose. And they most certainly do. Look, for instance, at Florida’s Sarasota County, where nearly 60 percent of ballots were cast for Trump last November. In that same election, 84 percent of voters opted to raise their own property taxes to support local schools. And according to the grassroots group Support Our Schools, Sarasota stands to lose big if the Department of Education gets the axe: $12.3 million for special education, $11.4 million for schools serving low-income students, and more than $4 million in other federal funds. Even in the midst of a raging culture war, Americans are still pragmatic people who maintain practical interests in their communities and the institutions that anchor them. So when the Trump administration lets loose a wrecking ball on the schools, it will likely produce more confusion than applause among his supporters. At that point, however, it may also be too late. The trick, then, is to sound an alarm now that can be heard across the partisan divide. Jack Schneider is Dwight W.

        "title": "Donald Trump’s Next Diversity Target: People With Disabilities | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The president’s disdain for disabled people—and obsession with genetic superiority—harks back to a grim past. President Trump’s suggestion last month that the tragic Potomac air crash was somehow the fault of disabled federal air traffic controllers was appalling—but it should have come as no surprise. Trump’s contempt for people with disabilities has been well documented, and it’s that animus, combined with the accelerating MAGA assault on diversity throughout the United States, that has disability rights advocates preparing to defend decades worth of hard-won protections. One month into his presidency, Trump has unleashed a government-wide attack on people with disabilities, from anti-diversity executive orders to proposed special-education rollbacks to threats to slash programs like Medicaid that are lifelines for disabled people across the country. If successful, these actions could have catastrophic consequences for millions of Americans, according to disability rights experts. “This is a crisis for the disability community, and the threat is extremely serious,” Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, told The Nation. “These changes have the potential to erode decades of progress that the disability community has fought tooth and nail to achieve.” Within 48 hours of taking office, Trump signed two executive orders targeting what he called “illegal” diversity programs—commonly referred to as DEI or DEIA—in both the federal government and the private sector. Trump and his MAGA minions claim that these programs, which promote the worthy goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility throughout American society, discriminate against, well, them, and so they should be abolished. At a time when Elon Musk and his DOGE henchmen are racing to “delete” entire federal agencies and fire thousands of government workers, diversity programs have become a convenient target for the drastic budget reductions that Trump seeks—under the bogus guise of “waste, fraud, and abuse”—in order to cut more taxes for rich people and corporations. Hence the MAGA/DOGE crusade to demonize and scapegoat diversity programs for all kinds of calamities, from plane crashes to wildfires to train derailments. Thus far, most of the focus on Trump’s diversity rollback has been on “DEI,” but it’s the “A”—for “accessibility”—that has alarmed disability rights advocates. “The hard-fought-for acceptance of people with disabilities in society is compromised every time Trump uses DEIA as a bogeyman for everything that’s wrong in society,” said Michael Rembis, a professor of history at the University of Buffalo and director of its Center for Disability Studies. “This purge of federal employees is in part designed to remove people who are perceived to be unproductive for both racist and ableist reasons from the federal government.” The Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990. Trump’s anti-diversity executive orders roll back more than three decades of US policy since then——including executive orders signed by Clinton, Obama, George W. Bush and Biden—aimed at bringing more people with disabilities into the federal workforce and the private sector. From hiring and job training to career development and workplace accommodation, these policies have given many disabled people new opportunities to thrive, and a new sense of dignity after generations of mistreatment in American society, from ostracization to institutionalization to forced sterilization. Those advances are now at risk, and the impacts are already being felt nationwide, as funding cuts loom for community organizations that provide crucial services and support systems for disabled people, from home modification to job coaching to transportation and personal attendant services. “We’ve heard from many organizations across the country that are having to think about cutting their staff, reducing their services, or even closing their doors,” said Town. Disability rights advocates warn that Trump’s anti-diversity executive orders are just a prelude to even more draconian attacks. For example, Trump’s avowed goal to eliminate the Department of Education could jeopardize special-education programs for roughly 7.5 million students—15 percent of the US student population. Trump’s plan to cut billions in grants issued by the National Institutes of Health threatens long-term research and development focused on life-saving—and life-improving—treatments for millions of Americans. And, of course, any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and particularly Medicaid—and let’s face it, the GOP wants to eliminate or privatize these programs altogether—will disproportionately affect millions of disabled people who rely on the programs to survive. “It would be catastrophic,” Rembis said of potential cuts to Medicaid. “For many people, Medicaid is literally their lifeline. It’s what sustains them. People who depend on these services to live wouldn’t have the medical equipment, the prescriptions, the healthcare, or the daily supports they need if these programs were limited, let alone cut. Thousands of people would die.” The Trump administration’s assault on government policies and programs that benefit disabled people is not just a scheme hatched in the bowels of The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 anti-government boiler room—although it is that, too. It’s also the natural evolution of Trump’s long-standing prejudice against people with disabilities. Trump’s disdain for disabled people is well known, from mocking reporter Serge Kovaleski and insulting wounded veterans to reportedly telling a relative with a disabled son that “maybe those kinds of people should just die.” Rembis said he was “shocked and appalled” by Trump’s baseless accusation mere hours after the Potomac air crash that diversity hiring programs generally—and disabled air traffic controllers specifically—were to blame for the tragedy. Trump presented zero evidence to back up his claim, as usual, but his goal wasn’t to present the facts to the public but once again to demonize and scapegoat marginalized communities any time something bad happens in America. Sasha Abramsky Elie Mystal Branko Marcetic Dave Zirin Joseph A. Stramondo, a professor of philosophy and an expert on bioethics and disability at San Diego State University, said Trump’s contempt for people with disabilities appears to be rooted in a binary worldview in which the so-called “makers” who build things are to be celebrated, while the so-called “takers” who supposedly leech off society are to be shunned—or removed entirely. This Manichean view, Stramondo said, owes much to eugenics, the discredited early-20th-century pseudo-scientific theory that ostensibly aimed to “improve” human genetics, but in practice targeted tens of thousands of “undesirable” members of American society, including poor, non-white, disabled, and “mentally defective” people, for institutionalization and forced sterilization. “Trump uses eugenic rhetoric and plays on stereotypes around disability, race, and gender for political gain,” said Stramondo. “The idea that there are some folks who draw more than their fair share of the public good and are therefore parasitic on the social fabric goes back hundreds of years, and it’s just as dangerous and toxic today.” It’s no secret that Trump is obsessed with genetics, as demonstrated by his preoccupation with bloodlines and frequent comments about “good” genes, “bad” genes, “low IQ individuals,” immigrants “poisoning the blood” of America, and other bigoted remarks. In 1988, Trump famously told Oprah Winfrey that people must have “the right genes” to become rich. Since then, he has repeatedly compared his family to purebred “racehorses.” In 2020, Trump again invoked the “racehorse” theory to assure a mostly white Midwestern audience that “you have good genes in Minnesota.” And just last year, he intimated—outrageously—that immigrants commit murder because “it’s in their genes.” Rembis, the University of Buffalo history professor, stopped short of calling Trump a eugenicist—“bigoted, racist, ableist, narcissist” were the words he used—but he said that Trump’s rhetoric about genetic superiority harks back to 1930s Germany. “Passing judgment and wanting to exclude people from society based on disabilities or perceived disabilities is certainly part of the legacy of eugenics.” It’s worth noting that disabled people were among the earliest victims of the Holocaust, condemned to death by a Nazi program called Aktion T4, which involved the systematic murder of some 300,000 people in psychiatric hospitals in Germany, Austria, and elsewhere in Europe. Stramondo doesn’t expect anything remotely like that to happen in the United States, but he pointed out that sterilization and murder aren’t the only ways to advance eugenic goals. “You can practice and enforce eugenic ideologies that result in lots of people suffering and even dying just by doing something like eliminating Medicaid,” he said. During a phone interview last week for this article, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, the bioethicist, disability scholar, and senior adviser at The Hastings Center, reminded me that “all of us will become disabled if we live long enough.” It’s equally true, if less elegantly phrased, that most of us know someone with a disability—a friend, a family member, a coworker. That’s why disability advocates expect an outpouring of protest as the full scope of Trump’s anti-disability agenda becomes clear. The resistance will take many forms: lawsuits, marches, advocacy, and, of course, that most American form of dissent—direct-action civil disobedience. “During the last Trump administration, we faced a serious threat to Medicaid, and so we came out in force, and we fought back,” said Stramondo, referring to the successful 2017 grassroots campaign to defeat the GOP plan to slash Medicaid and kill Obamacare. “We were fighting for our lives in the halls of Washington with nonviolent direct-action protests, and I’m sure we’re going to have to do it again. Whatever it takes.” Sam Gustin is a writer and editor based in New York City. The “liberal” news network is just the latest mainstream media organization to cower before Trump.

        "title": "After a North Carolina Election Loss, Amazon Union Organizers Must Think Bigger, Bolder | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Local organizers built a multiracial, multigenerational union with grassroots energy and tenacity. But Amazon is too big to beat through site-by-site organizing and striking. Garner, NC—The result in the end was disappointing, but not surprising. By an overwhelming 2,447 to 829, Amazon workers at the massive RDU1 warehouse here rejected union representation in six days of balloting last week. The campaign pitted the independent union CAUSE—Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment—against the second-largest private employer in the US. To label this a David-versus-Goliath fight would be an understatement. CAUSE is a homegrown union, started by RDU1 workers three years ago around core demands including a $30-an-hour starting wage, more paid time off, reasonable lunch breaks, and safety. The CAUSE members scrabbled together a bare-bones campaign budget with online fundraising campaigns and small grants. They built the fight with their own unpaid time and community volunteers. Amazon, implacably hostile to worker power, brought its full arsenal of union busting to RDU1. Atter the union filed for an election last December, Amazon began staging around-the-clock anti-union meetings—brainwashing sessions, in which company lawyers and managers threatened workers with loss of their already-meager benefits, characterized bargaining as a futile process, and engaged in character assassination of CAUSE leaders. Amazon played the race and xenophobia cards to split the workforce: Managers told Latino workers that the union was just for Black workers, and they cynically highlighted the Trump deportation machine to further intimidate immigrant workers, who constitute a quarter or more of the RDU1 workforce. Managers roamed the warehouse floor and singled out union supporters for harassment. In break rooms, CAUSE organizers reported, the company played “Vote No” videos on a continuous loop. They posted huge “Vote No” banners throughout the workplace. Anti-union literature was plastered everywhere, even in the bathroom stalls, while pro-union literature was promptly taken down. In the week leading up to the vote, Amazon erected fencing around the warehouse, posted security guards, and even arrested an Amazon worker—a union leader from the JFK8 facility in Staten Island, New York, who had come down to North Carolina to campaign with CAUSE. For the last two months, RDU1 has been a zone of class warfare, albeit extremely lopsided. It did not help matters that CAUSE fell short in several areas of organizing fundamentals. I spent several days in late January working directly with the CAUSE organizers in Garner, and among allies they were quite forthcoming about these shortcomings. The union filed its election petition above the requisite 30 percent threshold for union card sign-up, but well below the supermajority needed to endure the union-busting war. In an environment where narrative control is decisive, CAUSE organizers recognized that they had allowed workplace discussions to drift away from the workers’ core demands. They spent considerable time responding to the boss’s latest lies and misrepresentations and focused a lot on legalistic processes as opposed to framing the fight about power and control. Crucially, I saw that, in the face of this withering anti-union campaign, the union had not been able to sustain a broad enough structure inside RDU1—organizing committee members, each with their own discrete group of workers they were responsible for—to weather the bosses’ firestorm. That is a main reason CAUSE organizers opted to not conduct a “structure test”—like a warehouse-wide “vote yes” petition—in the run-up to the balloting. Such a structure test would have assessed their true support and locked in “yes” votes. All of these are shortcomings, to be sure, but while working alongside CAUSE I saw a creative, multiracial union led by Black and Latino workers, a vibrant organization steeped in democracy and fighting spirit. At a late-January union town hall, more than 60 RDU1 workers gathered in downtown Garner to discuss and debate issues. The union was founded by the Rev. Ryan Brown, a Baptist minister and an RDU1 worker until Amazon fired him last December, and Mary Hill, a feisty 70-year-old former truck driver who has spent the last year battling both Amazon and cancer. On display in the room that night was an eclectic mix including older African American church devotees, queer youth, socialist activists, middle-aged white workers, and immigrants from different Latin American countries. After three years of diligent organizing in a right-to-work state, under punishing circumstances, “Rev Ryan” and “Ma Mary,” as they are affectionately called by workers throughout RDU1, built a remarkable coalition. At a time when many union leaders are hunkering down and even cozying up to corporate America and Trump by showcasing their own xenophobia, the CAUSE workers had the guts to meet Amazon in open combat, fighting for all workers regardless of country of origin. Some labor organizers will argue that the CAUSE election loss shows the futility of elections. They could note that Amazon workers at the JFK8 warehouse won their union representation election nearly three years ago—and still remain stymied from bargaining by Amazon’s endless court appeals. Indeed, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the largest logistics workers’ union in the country, with campaigns at numerous Amazon worksites, has avoided representation elections at Amazon precisely because there is nothing free and fair about them in today’s America. But election avoidance is shallow analysis. There is no question that a union representation election today entails running a hostile gauntlet. The election path should not be undertaken lightly. Yet the strategy of eschewing elections and pressuring the company through demonstration strikes involving a minority of workers—as the Teamsters have done in New York, the Bay Area, Southern California, Chicago, and Atlanta—also hasn’t moved the company any closer toward union recognition. However, the Teamsters’ lack of success to date doesn’t invalidate the importance of striking; nor does the CAUSE election result discredit voting strategies. Elections can be an effective strategy, so long as they are undertaken with rigorous organizing method—including strong, broad, tested organizing committees—and are seen not as an end goal but as a structure test on an escalating pathway toward powerful, majority-participation strikes. But the central challenge facing today’s labor movement isn’t the elections-or-not conundrum. It is multiplying the scale of organizing by orders of magnitude. With 1,445 warehouses, delivery stations, and air cargo centers and 1.7 million direct employees and contractors nationwide, Amazon is simply too large to beat through site-by-site organizing and striking. Given today’s political landscape and Amazon’s anti-union track record, it’s safe to say that a CAUSE election win last week would not have resulted in bargaining. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin To build enough worker power to compel Amazon to bargain, organizing will need to happen at dozens if not hundreds of worksites simultaneously, escalating to majority strike actions on a scale that can truly disrupt the company’s operations. That will require organizing investments on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The combined Amazon organizing investment today by unions—largely the Teamsters—is just over $10 million annually. That is barely a start. What’s needed is annual organizing commitments to fund thousands of organizers—both inside and outside Amazon facilities—along with a robust campaign infrastructure to build a new CIO-style industrial organizing movement. That is eminently possible. Today, US labor movement assets top $35 billion—a 225 percent increase over the last 15 years, according to union researcher Chris Bohner. Collectively, the labor movement has sufficient resources to take on Amazon and win. But financing an industrial organizing campaign at Amazon requires a political decision by labor leaders—and the political will to follow through. Given the dire and declining state of labor and the central role of Amazon in the economy, what on earth are labor leaders waiting for? In December, the Teamsters led demonstration strikes at eight Amazon facilities. These were all minority strikes—only about 600 workers in total participated—but the actions themselves built worker confidence and sparked organizing conversations among workers in warehouses far away from the strike lines. The demonstration strikes represented both a positive step forward and a learning experience. Likewise, the CAUSE members and those around them, though not victorious in this round, led a principled fight and gained organizing chops. In the longer arc of labor’s existential struggle to organize at Amazon, the CAUSE election stands as another battleground where overmatched workers valiantly fought back. One hopes that CAUSE organizers will, in the wake of this lopsided defeat, draw lessons about the need to have a disciplined, tested, and broad union structure before plunging into battle again. Equally, one hopes that organizers looking from the outside will resist glib criticism of the CAUSE election, and instead seek to learn what CAUSE did right in building a multiracial, multigenerational union with sheer grassroots energy, chutzpah, and tenacity. Labor’s challenge is to imagine what is possible when the rank-and-file creativity of CAUSE workers and other Amazon workers around the country merges with the full resources of the US labor movement. That is a fight against Goliath that David might just be able to win. Jonathan Rosenblum is a union organizer and writer and a member of the National Writers Union.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Professors are experiencing an overwhelming sense of fear and disillusionment amid the crackdown of pro-Palestine protests. “I don’t know anybody who’s not scared right now.” A supporter of the pro-Palestinian encampment at UC Irvine in May 2024. Academic tenure is one of American higher education’s few guarantees. It protects scholarship and teaching from political constraints and censorship, earned after years of research and training. It’s a promise. Until, for Maura Finkelstein, it wasn’t. In September, Finkelstein was fired from Muhlenberg College after nine years of teaching for sharing an Instagram post in support of Palestine. An administrative investigation deemed her tenure insufficient to protect her job; a rare situation formerly reserved for cases of severe neglect of duty. She says she was naïve to be surprised. “There are things that we cannot say or talk about,” Finkelstein said. “If we say or talk about these things or support our students in their investment in speaking and talking about these things, then we may be suspended. We may be fired. We may be locked out of campus, as just happened at NYU. I think people are really, really, really concerned about the future of the university in the United States.” Before 2024, Finkelstein would have said the positive aspects of academia outweighed her fears. Now, she’s not so sure. “This past year, I have spent most of my time wondering what on earth our jobs are and what college professors are and aren’t allowed to do, both in terms of research and in the classroom. And I’m feeling pretty pessimistic about it,” she said. “I don’t know anybody who’s not scared right now.” Across America, professors are experiencing an overwhelming sense of disillusionment. Interviews of nearly 60 faculty by The Chronicle of Higher Education found dropping trust and increasing anger at policies and administrators after the pandemic. They’re seeing larger, more bureaucratic administrations—the president, provost, deans, associate deans, and governing board—more likely to punish students and faculty for protest activity. Even before the pro-Palestine protests and subsequent crackdown, attempts to sanction faculty surged between 2004 and 2022—from four to 145, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. It’s a trend in academia that Annelise Orleck, professor of history at Dartmouth College, has called the “criminalization of dissent.” Orleck has studied social protest movements as a historian nearly her entire 34-year career at Dartmouth. Last spring, she was pushed to the ground by police—called into Dartmouth by the president of the university and the board of trustees—and arrested while supporting the rights of her students to protest. “I looked out there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is fascism.’ And one of my colleagues said, ‘Don’t say that so loud, they’ll arrest you’ and I said, ‘They’re not gonna arrest me.’ But of course they did,” Orleck said. The police arrested 89 campus members—including more than 60 students—who were charged for trespassing on their own campus. “[There’s] a student organization that runs hikes and goes camping in the New Hampshire wilderness. The vans that they used to take students on these trips had the logos papered over, and Dartmouth had them at the ready for police to use for mass arrests that night.” In the months following, the Dartmouth faculty were divided on a no-confidence vote against the president. They did vote for a censure; the first presidential censure in Dartmouth’s more than 250-year history. The school’s chapter of American Association of University Professors is fighting back against restrictions on academic speech, including a policy put in effect on December 10 forbidding departments from making public statements—even on their own websites. Orleck has heard her colleagues say they should not have protests on campus. She’s always believed protests are part of a college education. “I would like to believe that in my long years here, there was not a time before this where colleagues would be supporting bringing in men with guns and truncheons onto our campus who assaulted students and faculty. I think this is a moment of extreme division, and I think the climate right now and this [university] president have exacerbated that.” Timothy Burke, a history professor at Swarthmore for over 30 years, says the shift toward more corporate administrative roles and less faculty governance began decades ago. Before that, faculty performed many of the roles administrators currently manage in conversation with students—such as admissions or creating regulations. Starting in the 1980s, professional administrators started to creating regulations, acting alone as faculty felt shut out. “There’s a thing called the ‘Red Book’ that was about a big two-day meeting between faculty and the student body from the 1960s at the height of student protest, where they canceled classes—seems unthinkable in the context of contemporary Swarthmore,” said Burke. “They had a conversation about the things that were changing in the world that a lot of students felt the faculty needed to change,” he said. “They wanted the faculty to abandon a number of the so-called parietal rules that govern student conduct, among them, specifying that premarital sex was cause for expulsion.” Many within academia are aware of these tensions and working to change them. Robert Goldberg, Swarthmore’s vice president for finance and administration, says establishing open communication between faculty, students, and administrators is a critical component of the liberal arts experience. He cited Swarthmore initiatives including Community Conversations, to foster dialogue, and “Lunch and Learn” to help community members learn about inclusive environments. Goldberg says college endowments and finances are often misunderstood. Many college protests over the past year have pushed for BDS divestment from Israel, which he said is complicated by the college’s diversification of assets overseen by external fund managers. “We also have to ensure that the endowment is a perpetual asset, meaning it needs to provide financial support to the college today and in the future so that the next generation of students can reap the same benefits as today’s students,” Goldberg said. “Our spending from the endowment is governed by specific rules to ensure that we maintain its buying power.… We do not invest in individual companies or stocks. Rather, we have a diversified portfolio across a number of asset classes. Those investments are overseen by about 100 different fund managers.” At Swarthmore, the endowment’s earnings provide for about half of the annual operating budget, with the majority going toward loan-free financial aid. Additionally, Goldberg says the cost of a student’s annual education to the college is $143,000, about $60,000 more than total tuition paid; the endowment subsidizes this gap, which is why its strength is so crucial. However, Burke believes this protection of the endowment is overemphasized at educational institutions, at the cost of other values. “It is corporate thinking, the idea that decision-making has to be fast, the decision-making has to be responsive to market conditions, in particular, the decision-making needs to put first and foremost revenue, budgetary health, etc., as the primal value. What you do is make as much money as you can, even if you’re a nonprofit,” said Burke. “Get on the firmest financial standing that you can reduce all risks, protect the endowment at all costs. But regardless, never do anything that might put the growth of the endowment at risk.” Finkelstein believes colleges’ finances have relied more on private donations, and so have their values and decisions. Colleges share of revenue coming from donations, rather than tuition, differs across the country depending on financial and endowment standing. Swarthmore, for example, has retained a more constant ratio of donations to tuition, where gifts account for about 2 percent of revenue. “My job is to interrogate and reveal how power operates, and that is what I have been doing for my entire career. There’s no reality in which I stopped doing that because my employer doesn’t want to alienate their donors,” Finkelstein said. “I don’t believe that I can be a trusted educator if I am not teaching my students the things that they need to know.” Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Todd Wolfson, who was elected president of American Association of University Professors (AAUP) national in the summer of 2024, thinks now is the moment to fight back. Wolfson, a professor of anthropology and media studies at Rutgers University, represents just under 10,000 unionized faculty and staff members at Rutgers, and worked on grad student campaigns while at the University of Pennsylvania. “The more I see the crisis that is consuming higher education in this country, the more I realize I want to help fight over the future of higher education.” Wolfson wants to build additional union chapters and recruit more members. He also wants to win a national commitment to fully fund public higher education, end student debt, ensure safe and secure jobs for workers, and fight for people to understand why higher education is valuable for America’s future. He has heard from AAUP’s members about self-censoring out of fear around protest restrictions. “I think right now only right-wing provocateurs are really talking about higher education, and they’re painting a very incorrect picture of the sector,” Wolfson said. “So we need to speak on our own behalf and transform the narrative about why higher education is so important to the future of this country.” But Burke says trust between administrators and faculty has been hard to restore as people retire and are hired frequently, and would require more than top-down policies to rebuild. “Trust is a culture problem. And culture problems are wicked problems…When you don’t have [trust] anymore, you can’t just recreate it by policy, because cultures that work well are built on complicated human relationships. They’re built on small, subtle things that you didn’t know were important until you don’t have them.” For Burke, a start to rebuilding culture and trust is by sharing more information on administrative decision-making with faculty. Finkelstein believes transparent faculty governance is crucial; As administrators have replaced faculty in governance roles and given faculty recommendations less weight, she says the outcomes and policy have resulted in a narrowing of academic freedom. Outside of administration, Orleck said she felt profoundly supported by her departments and, most importantly, students during her arrest. “Many people ask me that question. ‘How could you continue to work for a place that subjected you to physical violence?’” Orleck said. “I’m really committed to my students. I think we have shared a lot of very profound moments of change and community over the years, and I feel very supported by colleagues, past and present.” Finkelstein says the only hope she’s had recently has come from the student protests. Although colleges can be elite spaces, she says they can also be the crucible for social change and political revolution. “Whenever I want to hold on to possibility, I look at what our students are doing, and I look at how they’re showing us about the world and how they’re showing us a different model,” Finkelstein said. “These encampments were the best of what higher education can be. And so, of course, college and university administrators who are invested in keeping these institutions otherwise are going to destroy them.” Orleck thinks the situation represents a new wave of McCarthyism. The nature of student protests have not changed, she says. What has changed, as police in riot gear are called in, is the increase in violence and repression in response to protests. “I have suggested this unthinkable thing, which is that they just let students have their protest. They walk onto campus, they carry their signs, they chant, they have speeches, they go home and they study and nothing happens. It’s all peaceful…. That’s not viewed at this point as a credible suggestion, which says to me that things have changed, perhaps for a long time, and that’s chilling.” Orleck remembers younger faculty running from rural jail to rural jail the night of May 1 during the arrests, bailing out students. Afterwards, they held teach-ins, providing what Orleck called “tremendous amounts of intellectual, academic, and emotional labor.” “There’s no question I get depressed sometimes. I think both in terms of the neoliberal academy and the authoritarian academy, sometimes I feel like we’ve lost,” Orleck said. “But  then I have conversations with students. I had an amazing term both before and after I was beaten up by the police, and the students were incredible. I think we will all remember our time together, so I’m not willing to walk away from that yet.” Lucy Tobier is a 2024 Puffin student writing fellow covering labor for The Nation.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access By ceding the space on antisemitism—responding when we are accused of it, but not taking up the fight against it as our cause—we’ve created a strategic opportunity for the right. In early December 2023, a video about antisemitism went viral. The short clip came from a US House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing titled “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism.” This hearing took place amid alarm over Jewish students’ being harassed and attacked on American campuses. It also occurred in the context of a global spate of antisemitism: a Jewish woman stabbed in France, shootings at Jewish day schools in Canada, desecrations of Jewish buildings with hate-filled graffiti across Europe, protesters screaming “fuck the Jews” in Australia, a full-blown antisemitic riot in Russia’s Dagestan. It also followed the brutal rampage by Hamas on Israeli soil on October 7, in which some 1,200 people—mostly Israeli civilians—were killed and over 200 taken hostage. Israel immediately launched an unprecedented bombardment of the Gaza Strip. By the time that viral clip pinged onto my phone, tens of thousands of Palestinians, mostly women and children, had been killed or injured; the entire population of Gaza was being terrorized while the Strip was being made uninhabitable. The scale of Israel’s military response was so ferocious that in January 2024 the International Court of Justice would find there was plausible evidence that Israel was violating the genocide convention in Gaza. But in early December, at the House Committee hearing, the presidents of three of America’s leading universities—Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—were each asked variations of an apparently simple question: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate university rules or codes of conduct, yes or no?” Astoundingly, none of them answered with a simple “yes.” Instead, they each resorted to evasive legalese, hesitant gestures towards “context” and seemingly dispassionate distinctions. It was horrible to watch. It seemed to confirm that Jews could not count on anyone to even recognize antisemitism—let alone condemn it—at a time when anti-Jewish hatred was spiraling. And so, as is the way with social media firestorms, we were all drafted into taking sides, and the news headlines played out the debate day after day. In the end, two of the three testifying university heads resigned. All too predictably, however, that three-minute clip did not accurately represent the proceedings of a hearing that lasted over five hours. Instead, it depicted a trap that had been set by then–New York Republican Representative—now Trump’s nominee as ambassador to the United Nations—Elise Stefanik in framing that particular question. The presidents of three of the country’s most prestigious universities walked right into it. Stefanik had prepared her ambush by suggesting that chants of “Intifada,” Arabic for “uprising”—and a long-used slogan at Palestine solidarity marches—were equivalent to calls for genocide. The three university heads botched a basic moral question that shouldn’t require more than one second of thought. And yet anyone who watched the entire hearing could also see the three thinking seriously about how to safeguard Jewish students and other minorities—including Muslims also facing renewed threats—while protecting free speech on campus. Far from seeming dispassionate about the subject, these leaders came across as caring deeply about their responsibilities to their students. Claudine Gay, the former Harvard president who resigned following attacks that dragged on for weeks, spoke during the hearing on why antisemitism had flared at universities. “One of the things that has been laid bare over the last couple of months is how ill-equipped the community is and has been to deal with dialogue in moments of crisis,” Gay said. “Instead, what’s substituted for that is the ‘social mediafication’ of dialogue. It is intemperate, it’s ahistorical, it’s just mean, and it’s a way of engaging that has been deeply socialized through social media and is reflexive for a lot of the students on our campus.” She might as well have been talking about all of us. Because this is how the entire debate around antisemitism has been taking place—and for far too long. That short clip and the way it burned through our political ecosystem was a rerun of many similar controversies, containing all the hallmark features that have turned this issue into such a convoluted pileup, like an epic movie car crash. It demonstrated how claims of antisemitism are cynically invoked to silence pro-Palestinian voices—and then attached to a broader culture war that strikes out against antiracism, “wokeness,” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or just a generalized ”liberal elite.” It showed progressives tumbling into traps set by the right, while at the same time lacking the ability to recognize actual antisemitism. It showed a wearying tendency to force antisemitism into competition with other axes of oppression, instead of building a tent that could hold us all in it together. And of course, many felt it was absurd and insulting to be debating the semantics of supposedly and hypothetically calling for a genocide of Jews, while genocide experts were sounding alarm bells over the catastrophic situation actually unfolding in Gaza. It seemed surreal that, in that moment, pages of media coverage could be dedicated to the goings-on at relatively safe American universities. That clip and its aftermath were a dramatically scaled-up version of a row we’ve been having for some time. Because the way antisemitism is talked about—in the media and by our leading politicians—has made it entirely incomprehensible. But it isn’t just the politicians. We are all bad at talking about or understanding antisemitism: Jewish or not, antiracist, educated, whether you refresh your newsfeed regularly or skip to the recipe and fashion pages (no judgement). We all fall victim to blind spots and biases. Lack of awareness, after all, is not a crime. Or it might simply be confusion or not knowing where to start. The issue has been rendered indecipherable, densely unapproachable, requiring too much time and effort before yielding any clarity. While accusations of antisemitism all too often appear to boil down to merely being critical of Israel—or being in the “wrong” political camp—people remain afraid to ask about it, lest their questions themselves be misconstrued. People worry—with reason—that spurious claims might one day be made against them. “If you had told me a decade ago that this is what I would be doing, I would have been shocked and so confused,” says Charlotte Fischer. For almost 20 years, Fischer has worked within British Jewish communities on social justice movements—refugee resettlement schemes and campaigns for a living wage. Ten years ago, she says, “I wasn’t thinking about [antisemitism] at all.” By 2018, she had cofounded a training program in recognizing and dealing with antisemitism and was taking it to progressive groups across the UK. Sasha Abramsky Dave Zirin Elie Mystal Branko Marcetic When she tells me this, I feel a flash of recognition. Antisemitism wasn’t my beat, either. For decades, I have written about politics and current affairs, from anti-capitalist protests to the Arab uprisings, from the UK’s toxic immigration politics to pandemic profiteering, and “What the hell is happening?” explainer pieces on Brexit commissioned by bewildered American editors. I reported on the Israel-Palestine conflict, spending years based in the region. That did sometimes include covering instances when voices critical of Israel were being decried as “antisemitic.” But antisemitism itself? Not my beat. Sure, I would read the reports and follow the debates, but actually covering the issue was not something I thought about. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, few of the Jewish progressives I knew were even talking about antisemitism, either. Back then, we were not yet smack in the middle of the resurgent nativist populism that flared up with far-right wins across continental Europe and then exploded into mainstream politics with the rise of Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and Brexit Britain. Now, the most powerful men in the world capitalized on fog-horning all the festering prejudices that people previously at least had the good sense not to express out loud. Inevitably, when the social guardrails around racism came off, antisemitism slipped in. With the far right in ascendancy across the world, Jewish people turned to leftist movements that had long served as our political homes—and found them not only lacking the language to speak to what was happening but also often mired in ignorance over antisemitism. As American communications specialist Sharon Goldtzvik told me: “We as progressives should be leading on the issue of antisemitism, but it has become a critical vulnerability, rather than a critical strength.’” This Achilles heel has been seized upon by the right wing, derailing progressive movements and thwarting efforts at social, economic, and climate justice across the world. It is undermining the Palestinian cause at a time when solidarity is most critical. It is dividing antiracist movements. It is helping an increasingly extreme right wing keep winning elections around the globe. In Doppelganger, Naomi Klein’s latest book—inspired by her experience of being repeatedly mixed up with Naomi Wolf (the liberal feminist icon turned conspiracy theorist and darling of the MAGA faithful)—she writes that politics is no longer driven by values or ideological beliefs but is instead dominated by warring camps perpetually reflecting each other, so that all of politics increasingly feels like a mirror world, with society split in two and each side defining itself against the other—whatever one says and believes the other seems obliged to say and believe the exact opposite. The deeper I went, the more I noticed this phenomenon all around me. Individuals not guided by legible principles or beliefs, but acting as members of groups playing yin to the other’s yang. Klein dissects the way the far right, using the language of the left, reflects all kinds of reasonable fears about the ravages of a people- and planet-crushing socioeconomic system—but then spins them out into wild conspiracy theories and hateful narratives. That same dynamic is at play in our discussions about antisemitism. The left has ceded the space on antisemitism—responding when we are accused of it, perhaps, but not taking up the fight against it as a left-wing cause. And the right has strategically filled that void by constructing a divisive narrative that allows antisemitism to fester—while making it impossible to have a real conversation about it. When I mentioned that I was writing this book, several of my friends reacted as if I had just said I planned to jump into a vat of radioactive waste. In recent years, every national conversation I’ve participated in about antisemitism has quickly turned toxic. When claims of antisemitism against the Labour party’s former leader Jeremy Corbyn erupted in 2018, I found myself in the middle of a now familiar pattern of misunderstandings, mismanagement, and distortion: accused by the right of supporting antisemitism, accused by the left of participating in a smear campaign against them, while the Labour party descended into a full-blown crisis. After Labour lost the 2019 general election and a new leader was elected, I appeared on a BBC radio program in November 2020 to discuss the topic. I argued that while the antisemitism within Corbyn’s Labour was real, his successor Keir Starmer’s blunt, factionally driven approach to the issue was making matters worse. “Well, what do you suggest then?” asked the interviewer, and I could hear the puzzlement in his voice. I didn’t blame him. I sounded like the Goldilocks of antisemitism. But in the years since, discussion of the subject has only grown more polarized and incomprehensible. Meanwhile in the context of Israel’s savage flattening of Gaza, the specter of antisemitism was raised in the most damaging way to try to stop people from crying out against the atrocities—even, surreally, when those voices were themselves Jewish, even when the cries were coming from Israeli Jews. All too often, the left has forgotten to apply to antisemitism the frames of analysis already available within our movements. We have forgotten that racism and antisemitism have always been intertwined, because racists across the centuries have constantly swapped notes on how to demonize, persecute, enslave, or violently oppress groups of people racialized as “other.” But we cannot tackle racism in the silos created by racism itself. Understanding the fight against racism and antisemitism as a shared, collective struggle will fortify progressive movements, bringing moral cohesion, strategic power, and greater inclusion. It will also help us to make sense of the alarming, divisive, and destructive far-right shift around the world—because only then do we stand a chance of stopping it.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Three members of CUNY Graduate Center’s student government face an anti-discrimination investigation for a resolution endorsing the demands of last year’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment. CUNY students and faculty rally at City College before testifying at a board of trustees meeting on February 10. The NYPD had already fenced off City College by the time Dan West, a PhD candidate at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center, arrived last April 30. West had come to the flagship campus in Harlem to join students who had mounted a Gaza solidarity encampment just six days earlier. Instead, he watched as hundreds of police officers stormed in. West said he was struck by how indiscriminate the arrests seemed to be, with many happening on the street outside the school. “People showed up to provide support and were scooped up and zip-tied on a school bus,” he said. “The NYPD and Adams’s spectacle was indifferent to a target.” Watching that raid—which was approved by the school’s chancellor—motivated West, who had previously focused on labor organizing. He was already running for the Graduate Center’s student government, the Doctoral and Graduate Student Council, as part of a coalition of student groups that included members of CUNY for Palestine. Within weeks of the raid he and over 30 others from the same slate of candidates were elected to the DGSC, securing a majority. That slate of representatives, organized under the banner “Free Palestine, Strike CUNY, Access for All!,” is an attempt “to carry that memory [of the encampment] forward with us, especially as the genocide has dragged and dragged,” West said. To them that meant passing a resolution in the DGSC that supported the CUNY encapment’s “Five Demands for Palestine.” On October 18, the student government voted 31 to 8 to adopt a resolution that endorsed the demands word for word. Those demands include calls for CUNY to economically and culturally boycott Israel. Based on previous records, CUNY is believed to have millions of dollars in investments and contracts with weapons manufacturing, technology, and construction companies—like Northrop Grumman, Dell, and Caterpillar—that Palestinian civil society says are complicit in Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. Its refusal to reveal its current investment records after CUNY for Palestine and CUNY Law Students for Justice in Palestine filed a Freedom of Information Law request is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit by the New York Civil Liberties Union. In the spirit of those demands, the DGSC instituted a boycott of its own. It restricted the use of its resources—student activity fees and grants for student events—from being used on “products or services that support or benefit from the US-backed Israeli occupation of Palestine,” according to the resolution. To avoid ambiguity, the resolution listed the companies the DGSC would boycott, including HP, Starbucks, McDonalds, and Sabra. By November, though, the DGSC’s three cochairs—West included—learned they were facing an investigation by their school for the resolution’s alleged violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in institutions that receive federal funding. Depending on the investigation’s outcome they could face stiff penalties, including expulsion. In the case of one of the co-chairs, an international student, it could result in their visa being revoked—a possibility all the more real with President Trump’s recent executive order. The students say the inquiry shows that CUNY is escalating a crackdown on the student movement for Palestinian freedom that threatens academic freedom at the school. “It seems like a very uneven application of this Title VI policy,” said Simone Parker, a doctoral student at the Graduate Center and one of the three DGSC representatives under investigation. “That it’s directed at what was a democratic decision seems unprecedented,” she said. Pro-Israel students and faculty, interest groups and donors, as well as city, state, and federal politicians have slammed CUNY’s administrators for failing to crack down on pro-Palestinian student organizing, saying the demonstrators are contributing to a climate of anti-Jewish hatred across the university’s 25 campuses. In September, a report commissioned by Governor Kathy Hochul that focused on a supposed crisis of unchecked antisemitism at CUNY recommended changes to CUNY’s discrimination policies and procedures that Hochul has since said CUNY must fully implement. But legal advocates, students, and faculty are warning some of its guidelines could infringe on students’ right to protected political speech, particularly on a matter of grave public concern: US support for the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. The DGSC leaders fear the investigation into their roles in student government is a reflection of the political pressure bearing down on the administration and could signify intensifying repression at CUNY. “The more the CUNY administration attempts to silence students and faculty speaking in support of Palestine the more they reveal their utter ethical bankruptcy,” said CUNY for Palestine in a statement to The Nation. “We are inspired by the incredible steadfastness of the Palestinian people, and what students and faculty undergoing repression here in the US face is obviously nothing compared to the injustice and violence that Palestinians have faced now for over 77 years.” Sasha Abramsky Dave Zirin Elie Mystal Branko Marcetic In November, CUNY chancellor Felix Matos-Rodríguez appeared before the City Council Committee of Higher Education for a hearing on the antisemitism probe’s findings. Matos-Rodríguez was quick to assure the council that the university was implementing its recommendations. An area of particular interest to the council members was one of the report’s more controversial positions: its suggestion that CUNY adopt the definition of antisemitism put forth by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance—which suggests criticism of Israel as a racist endeavor is antisemitic—in its antidiscrimination investigations. In a letter written to Matos-Rodríguez in January, the New York Civil Liberties Union argued that the IHRA framework has been “weaponized” against “first amendment-protected criticism of Israeli policies,” with the most common targets of these attacks being “university students, professors, and grassroots organizers.” While Matos-Rodríguez refrained from saying that CUNY would adopt a singular definition of antisemitism, he assured the legislators that each campus’s chief diversity officer—those in charge of antidiscrimination investigations like the one faced by the DGSC cochairs—had received training on the IHRA definition. That CUNY could be enforcing a definition of antisemitism that conflates criticism of Israel with anti-Jewish bias is “deeply concerning,” said Golnaz Fakhimi, legal director of Muslim Advocates, a legal advocacy organization that defends Muslims from discrimination. “When anti-Jewish bias is defined to include criticism of [Israel’s] practices, the consequence of that is itself discriminatory. It amounts to anti-Palestinian racism,” she said. In April, Muslim Advocates represented eight CUNY students in a federal lawsuit that claimed CUNY Law School was illegally repressing student advocacy for Palestinian rights. Muslim Advocates also brought a civil rights complaint against the law school to the Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Education, alleging anti-Palestinian discrimination. The group also supported students from two other CUNY campuses in bringing similar complaints. All three complaints were folded into a settlement between CUNY and OCR that included other complaints alleging antisemitism, requiring CUNY to update OCR on the spread of its discrimination complaints and what changes it makes to its policies. Despite being on the hook with OCR, Fakhimi fears CUNY isn’t giving equal weight to the concerns raised in the three complaints. “That is hugely worrisome, knowing what I do about CUNY as an institution,” she said. “It’s the largest urban public university system in the country. It includes so many students and faculty who come from communities that are Black, African, Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian. It includes so many community members who are speaking up for Palestinian lives and freedom.” On January 29, Trump signed another executive order aimed at “combating antisemitism.” The order directs federal agencies like the Justice and Education departments to evaluate all legal frameworks at their disposal to curb what is an IHRA-like definition of antisemitism. That order was followed by a memorandum from Attorney General Pam Bondi establishing a joint task force that would, among other things, investigate and prosecute “antisemitic civil rights violations, and other federal crimes committed by Hamas supporters in the United States, including on college campuses.” Altogether, the executive order and DOJ memo signal that the Trump administration is “considering trying to strong-arm campuses in ways that could be unlawful,” Fakhimi said. “Campuses should reject any invitation to capitulate blindly to the administration. If they do, it could create legal exposure for them and otherwise hurt their standing and their stated mission of promoting learning.” The investigation into the DGSC leaders—two of whom have since stepped down from their positions as cochairs—stems from at least four complaints filed through CUNY’s University Wide Discrimination and Retaliation Portal alleging that the boycott resolution constitute a variety of forms of discrimination including those based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, and military status. None of those reports, however, name the three cochairs of the DGSC as offenders. Though Parker was a cochair of the DGSC at the time of the resolution’s passage, her status as an alternate representative means she didn’t cast a vote—though she said she would have. “This is the will of my peers. It’s not even just about my opinion. It’s a democratic process and it seems like certain members of the administration are trying to undermine it.” Both Parker and West feel that they are being targeted as part of a strategy meant to pressure them into publicly recanting the resolution as leaders of the student body. “It becomes way harder to organize as a collective if risk is fundamentally different for different individuals,” West said. “This strategy has forced us to think about that all the time.” But they say that their resolve, and that of their peers, is strong despite the administration’s tactics. On February 3, during a public meeting held by CUNY’s board of trustees, dozens of students and faculty reiterated their demands for Palestinian liberation and denounced the school’s escalating crackdown on solidarity efforts. The protesters highlighted the “repeated weaponization of Title VI discrimination complaints against CUNY students and workers to chill academic freedom and intimidate those who would speak out about Palestine,” a press release from CUNY Law SJP read. In 2016, a different resolution endorsing a boycott of Israel was passed by the DGSC that did not garner a Title VI inquiry into the body. An executive order signed that year by then-Governor Andrew Cuomo outlawed all state agencies from investing in companies or institutions determined to boycott Israel by the state. In conversations with the co-chairs, CUNY Graduate Center President Joshua Brumberg wielded a popular misinterpretation of the executive order as one that bans state agencies from engaging in boycotts of Israel to claim that the DGSC resolution is illegal. But Parker disagrees. “We are protected by free speech. You can have executive orders—we’re seeing it happen in real time now—that come into conflict with constitutional law,” she said. Ultimately, Parker believes the resolution embodies what academia is supposed to be about. “I feel like [administrators] think that we’re doing irrelevant things to our work, but this is actually at the crux of our jobs,” Parker said. “Academia needs to take a look at itself.” Luca GoldMansour is a Lebanese-American journalist from New York City.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Behind the language of “spending offsets” lies a stark reality: over $3 trillion in cuts that would reshape Americans’ access to healthcare. Only eight days into his presidency, Donald Trump and his administration tried to end Medicaid for 22 million Americans. All 50 states were locked out of their Medicaid portals thanks to a memo from Trump’s team. It was their first attempt to steal your healthcare, but it won’t be their last. Republicans have retaken the White House with a crystal-clear fiscal agenda: deep cuts to programs that you and your family rely on and tax cuts for Donald Trump and his billionaire kitchen cabinet. Their “cost-cutting” target to finance government handouts to oligarchs? Healthcare, healthcare, healthcare. Trump has already signed an executive order rescinding key aspects of former President Joe Biden’s work to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Trump also overturned Biden’s “Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans” order that would have—no surprise here—lowered drug costs for Americans. It’s absolutely not just Trump. When asked about Trump’s move to kick millions of Americans off Medicaid, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said, “I fully support it.” During his confirmation hearing, RFK Jr.—Trump’s pick to lead the agency that runs Medicaid—kept confusing the program with Medicare and refused to say that healthcare is a human right. House Budget Committee chair Jodey Arrington is circulating what Republican leadership calls a “menu” of potential spending cuts. Behind the bureaucratic language of “spending offsets” lies a stark reality: over $3 trillion in proposed healthcare cuts that would reshape Americans’ access to healthcare as we know it, with impacts falling heaviest on children, seniors, and rural communities. To understand what’s really at stake, we need to look past the talking points to see how these changes would play out in our communities. Consider Medicaid: Four in 10 American children rely on it for their healthcare. It covers 41 percent of all births in our nation. Perhaps most striking, five in every eight nursing home residents depend on Medicaid to fund their care. The proposed changes would fundamentally alter this vital program. By implementing per-person spending caps and slashing federal support, Republican plans would force impossible choices onto state governments. States would face an inevitable triangle of pain: cut benefits, reduce the number of people who are covered, or raise in-state taxes. There’s no fourth option. Rural America would bear a particularly heavy burden. The changes to Medicare in the Budget Committee’s plan would cut hospital payments in ways that would threaten the survival of already struggling rural hospitals. These facilities, often the only healthcare provider for miles, operate on razor-thin margins. When they close, they don’t just take healthcare with them—they take emergency services, jobs, and often the economic heart of their communities. In our cities, safety-net hospitals that serve our most vulnerable populations would face a double blow. The plan cuts both their Medicare payments and support for uncompensated care—the costs they incur treating patients who can’t pay. These hospitals, already operating at the financial edge, would face stark choices about reducing services or closing departments. Here’s the important thing for Democrats and all Americans to know: Republican politicians have carefully structured this plan to obscure their political responsibility. They don’t want you to know they are responsible. When your local hospital reduces services or closes, hospital officials will be the ones making the announcement. When your state cuts Medicaid benefits or eligibility, your governor and state legislature will have to deliver the news. But make no mistake—these would be forced choices, the inevitable result of Republican policy decisions, because they control the federal government. The real impact would cascade through our communities in ways that touch countless lives: the young family relying on Medicaid for their child’s asthma medication, the rural senior who would have to drive an extra hour for emergency care after their local hospital closes, the nursing home resident whose family would suddenly face impossible choices about care. That’s why this fight matters. Groups like American Bridge 21st Century and others must ensure that Americans understand the true stakes—that their representatives cannot hide behind complex funding formulas or shift blame to state governments. We must stay focused on the reality that funding tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting healthcare for working families is a choice Republicans are actively making to appease the billionaire class, not an inevitability. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin As we enter this new administration, Americans should ask themselves: Who is being asked to sacrifice, and who is lining their pockets with gold? Who is cutting their medication in half to save money, and who is flush with Big Pharma profits? Who is sitting at the table, and who is on the menu?

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Linda McMahon’s foundation has donated millions to groups that advocated for DEI programs, lauded affirmative action, and criticized Donald Trump. Linda McMahon and Donald Trump listens during the inaugural meeting of the President’s National Council for the American Worker in 2018. As President Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Education, Linda McMahon would be tasked with carrying out the GOP leader’s education agenda, including a roll back of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. But, interestingly, financial documents reviewed by The Nation show that McMahon’s foundation has contributed millions of dollars to organizations that espouse views in opposition to the 47th president. These donations seem to conflict with her public right-wing stances, even as Trump continues to demand personal and party loyalty among his political appointees. The president has rapidly formed a new coalition—among his cabinet, on Capitol Hill, in the halls of the West Wing, and beyond—centered on hostility toward the Department of Education and DEI programs nationally. With a confirmation hearing scheduled for February 13, McMahon submitted financial disclosure documents listing her as the director, secretary, treasurer, and member of the Vince and Linda McMahon Family Foundation. Tax returns for this foundation show a long history of philanthropy by the McMahons, including donations to various education-focused organizations. Since 2011, the foundation has donated at least $1.97 million to Achievement First, a string of charter schools in New England primarily serving students of color. While Trump has publicly signaled his support for charter schools, he has moved to cut off all federal funding from schools which promote what he calls “discriminatory equity ideology.” Achievement First, though, has a multiyear history of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and opposing Trump’s actions during his first term, including his threats to immigration protections. Achievement First has described DEI as “a philosophy that we live and breathe.” “Diversity, equity, and inclusion aren’t just guidelines that sit in some employee handbook,” their website reads. The network also explicitly says it exists “to address the legacy of racism in education. We reflect and talk about the role race plays in our work, experiences, and decisions. We strive to be constantly anti-racist in our words and actions.” In response to the president’s latest battle against DEI programs, many education institutions, which receive billions in federal funding from the Department of Education, have scrubbed or altered their public stances on diversity programs. But Achievement First has not, as of this writing. McMahon’s foundation has contributed more than $800,000 since the organization added a DEI policy to its website in 2019. When Trump attempted to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals during his first term, Achievement First issued a statement condemning the threat, promising to keep the immigration status of its students confidential. The group also sent members of their lobbying team to Capitol Hill to implore members of Congress to oppose Trump’s agenda. That year, McMahon donated $250,000 to the organization. When the Supreme Court outlawed race-based affirmative action in college admissions, Achievement First signed on to a 2023 joint statement calling the ruling “devastating.” McMahon donated $250,000 that year. These ideals stand in opposition to Trump’s own platform and the purported values of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a right-wing think tank whose board McMahon chairs, which praised the Supreme Court’s decision. McMahon’s foundation has also donated $125,000 to ConnCAN, a Connecticut-based nonprofit advocating for increased public school funding and DEI training in educator hiring. Trump and McMahon’s AFPI have refocused their attention away from public school funding to “school choice,” which allows parents to use taxpayer funding allocated for public education at private institutions. Trump himself has also called for schools to embrace “patriotic values” and a cut in funding for schools teaching “inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.” It is unclear what topics this would encompass. The White House, Department of Education, AFPI, Achievement First, and ConnCAN all did not respond to a request for comment. The office of Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who sits on the committee overseeing McMahon’s Thursday hearing, declined to comment on the nominees ahead of any confirmation votes. The committee’s chairman, Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), did not respond to a request for comment. Even with donations to these liberal-leaning groups, McMahon has been a power player in Republican circles for years. After two failed campaigns for the US Senate, she assumed a place inside the Beltway as a Republican mega donor, relying on deep pockets lined from her time as president and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. After serving as the top-ranking official in the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term, she stepped down to run a pro-Trump super PAC. If confirmed, she has vowed to resign from her foundation. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin If she secures enough votes to become secretary, one of McMahon’s main objectives will be to “put herself out of a job,” Trump said last week. Fulfilling a longtime campaign promise, Trump is reportedly taking the first steps toward shutting down the Department of Education. In late January, employees at the department were placed on administrative leave in an effort to comply with Trump’s executive orders on DEI, according to a letter obtained by The Nation. The union representing the employees has said that approximately 100 of their members have been put on leave. Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, confirmed that they “are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests.” On Sunday prior to the Super Bowl, Trump warned that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency will target the Department of Education—the latest episode in the billionaire’s weeks-long crusade to reshape the federal government. On Monday evening, DOGE announced that it had allegedly cut nearly $1 billion in contracts and grants disbursed by the Department of Education. “By selecting Linda McMahon, Donald Trump is showing that he could not care less about our students’ futures,” National Education Association president Becky Pringle said in a statement. “McMahon’s only mission is to eliminate the Department of Education and take away taxpayer dollars from public schools.” Owen Dahlkamp is a 2024 Puffin student writing fellow for The Nation.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The University of Chicago, despite its free speech reputation, has laid the groundwork for the president’s threats against students who protest for Palestine. University police on the University of Chicago campus as they break up a pro-Palestinian encampment. Afew hours before Yom Kippur began last October—when I and other Jews abstain from bathing until sundown the next day—I was pepper-sprayed. After several shots directly in my eyes, I held a temporarily disabled protester with one arm, leaned on my cane, and pulled us both out of the crowd. Reaching safety, I had minutes to scrub the chemical residue from my arms and soothe my inflamed throat and lungs before the sun set. I had kept my mask on out of fear of being recognized, which left me with a chemical burn across my face. I woke the morning of Yom Kippur with burning skin still hot to the touch. Pepper spray has been banned for use in war for nearly three decades, but not at University of Chicago or the campuses across the country during the protests against the Genocide in Gaza. On October 11, demonstrators hung a banner across the main entrance to University of Chicago’s campus demanding “Free Palestine. Hands Off Lebanon” and locked the wrought-iron gates. I was among dozens of student, faculty, and community protesters who were maced, corralled with batons, kicked in the groin, and told to “watch our feet” as officers attempted to drive a car through our barricade. And while University of Chicago students took alternate routes to class, every university in Gaza has been shut down by Israeli-American bombs. As universities mobilize their private security forces, enlist the police, and cooperate with the FBI, they not only fail to protect speech, but actively suppress it. These administrations have laid the bureaucratic groundwork for Trump to act on his threats: “One thing I do, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave.” Shortly after his inauguration those threats materialized, as Trump signed an executive order to cancel the visas of students who participated in protests for Palestine. Universities echo the demand to “behave” as they restrict legal protest to that which is “responsible,” “orderly,” “peaceful,” “compliant,” and “authorized.” Following the wave of campus encampments last year, both public and private universities have been quietly implementing new policies that criminalize and repress organizing. Across the country, protesters can no longer use a bullhorn, demonstrate after 10 pm or with more than 100 people, or chalk unauthorized, without fear of being evicted, expelled, banned from campus, and deported. Some universities have even closed their campuses to the public. The University of Chicago, despite its free speech reputation, is no different. In the wake of significant escalation by police on October 11, administrators offered their typical justification: that they are “committed to upholding the rights of protesters to express their views”—so long as our protest does not include posting signs, “amplified sounds,” or disruptions to the “functioning of the University.” The University of Chicago’s branding as a “free speech” university began in 1967 with the Kalven report on the institution’s role in political action. University administrations might consider an honest reading of the Kalven report, which they use to rationalize their violence as neutral. “The instrument of dissent and criticism is the individual faculty member or the individual student,” reads the report, which is to say, the institution itself maintains its power through a façade of powerlessness. “Maintaining the veneer of free speech protects the university from accountability while it continues all of its practices of investments and weapons manufacturers, practices of perpetrating displacement here on the South Side and in Palestine, and its practices of surveillance,” said one student organizer, who goes by Emily. Institutional neutrality, according to the University of Chicago free speech principles, requires institutions to allow “political action and social protest.” But speech that must be authorized is not free, and truly free speech carries risk. Effective protest makes explicit the implicit violence we live with every day: It agitates, amplifies, and occupies. Unsettling these contradictions provokes sometimes life-altering and life-threatening consequences. But the university, according to the Kalven report, is responsible for letting speech and the ramifications of it unfold, not preempting and repressing the speech itself. As Mamayan Jabateh—who was evicted, banned from campus, and detained at Chicago Police headquarters for 30 hours after allegedly participating in the October 11 protest—told the press: the university “undermines the academic capacities and futures of Chicagoans under the illusion that it is their source of empowerment and education for all. For whom? Certainly not for students of color practicing their right to autonomy and free speech.” We do not need to wait for Trump to retaliate against student protesters—universities are acting out his whims already within their borders. Less than a month after receiving an anonymous 100 million dollar gift to support “free expression,” our administration demonstrated exactly who is and is not included in that freedom. In 2024, the University of Chicago alone arrested 29 students, two faculty, and even more community members, evicted two students, withheld five diplomas, pepper sprayed dozens, and took disciplinary action against more. “The language of free speech is used by the university to stifle any movement for actual change. It is a method of silencing and control,” said Emily. “The university is sending its police to monitor people in their dorms, is surveilling people across campus, is sanctioning them with no process for standing up against genocide.” Upon ending the encampment, president Alivisatos claimed that participants’ “policy violations will be reviewed evenhandedly,” but the students prevented from graduating and evicted were not given due process under the university’s own disciplinary policy, nor Illinois housing law. Violating university and state law, and then changing policies to accommodate their new repression tactics, is not “evenhanded.” According to the 2016 Chicago Principles, in essence a sequel to the Kalven report, “the University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.” In a period where protest is increasingly criminalized, demonstrators need real protection. Protection is not just a question of speech, but material, financial, and legal support. The University of Chicago, like any other, has made clear what kinds of protection they can offer if they so choose. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin The university “is a community but only for the limited, albeit great, purposes of teaching and research,” reads the Kalven report. But it offers more than access to libraries and lecture halls; it controls the employment, housing, citizenship status, and futures of many of their students, faculty and workers. “If the university actually cared about protecting our free speech, they wouldn’t allow their private police force or the Chicago police department to invade the learning environment and workplace of thousands of undergraduates and graduate students,” said Brianna Suslovic, a social-work PhD candidate and union steward who was pepper-sprayed during last year’s graduation protest. As a condition for meeting with administration during the encampment, administration promised students they would introduce the Gaza Scholars At Risk program, which includes help with “visa and travel arrangements, healthcare, housing and furniture, bank accounts, and education options for dependents.” But no steps have been taken publicly to act on this promise, leaving eight families in Gaza adrift. The new federal administration has explicitly promised to restrict university members’ free expression. Our campus administration has not only failed their responsibility to protect us—they have called on their own police to repress us. Two weeks after the October 11 protest, students delivered a 1,500-signature petition to administrators calling to reverse the eviction of a demonstrator. After administrators refused, protests continued in January as the Council on University Programming announced the cancellation of Kuvia, a 40-year-old tradition, following the arrest and eviction of the event’s primary organizer. In its place, students held a “week of healing,” which ranged from a Shim Sham dance session to a press conference for Jabateh. On January 16, demonstrators rallied outside the president’s on-campus house while a holiday party took place inside. University police showed up in large numbers and escorted faculty to the side entrance, away from the protest. Students are planning actions for the duration of the quarter. “Their increased police presence tells us that the university sees us as a threat. Regardless of this attempt at repression, we are fighting back. We need support from the whole university community to tell the administration that they can’t just step on us,” said an organizer with Students for Justice in Palestine. Regarding the possibility of returning to campus, Jabateh questioned, “What am I returning to? An institution that labels me a threat? A campus where I no longer feel safe or welcome because I dared not to support their complicity?” “We can pick apart this university,” yelled one speaker during the October action, “and when we do, we can build something better in its place.” The following Monday after Yom Kippur, the pepper spray still lingered on my eyelashes. It burned when I let myself tear up for the first time. The only way to truly flush it, I am learning, is to cry out. Harley Pomper is a PhD student in social work at the University of Chicago.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Three graduate students identified over 30 violations of long-standing protocols, including using the NYPD to mass-arrest activists, in a New York civil suit against the university. An NYPD officer in front of pro-Palestinian protesters outside of Columbia University in New York City in April 2024. On February 3, three Columbia graduate students  sued the university for its crackdown on pro-Palestine protesting. The New York civil suit—brought by Catherine Curran-Groome, Aidan Parisi, and Brandon Murphy—identified over 30 violations of long-standing protocols, including two occasions when then-president Minouche Shafik summoned the NYPD to mass-arrest demonstrators standing against Israel’s war on Gaza. While Columbia may have dropped from mainstream media headlines in the months since police forcefully emptied  Hamilton Hall of student protesters and  swept the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, the story never ended for those on campus. The three plaintiffs were set to graduate this May, but after enduring months of “indefinite interim suspensions,” convoluted disciplinary hearings, and harassment, the university derailed their education by suspending each for one to two years. “These students should be honored for their bravery, leadership, and moral clarity,” says James Carlson, an attorney for the plaintiffs. “Instead, they’ve had their lives and careers unjustly sabotaged.” “By continuously delaying students’ hearings related to Hind’s Hall and the encampments…for over nine months now, the university is forcing [us] into a disciplinary purgatory,” Curran-Groome told The Nation. All plaintiffs encountered Columbia’s disciplinary process after participating in on- and off- campus demonstrations, vigils, and educational events to, as the lawsuit reads, “protest Israeli military activity and garner support for a ceasefire in Gaza.” The plaintiffs allege that over the last year and a half the university has abrogated its responsibility to heed Columbia rules and policies in order to target and penalize engagement in anti-war efforts. For one, Carlson says that inviting law enforcement—who were armed with  guns,  sledgehammers,  batons and  flashbang explosives—to terrorize students in April of last year,  infringed on Section 444.f. of the University Statutes, which obligates the university president to consult with “a majority of a panel” established by the Columbia senate’s executive committee, prior to inviting police on to campus. On April 19, the day of the  first mass arrest, the executive committee did “not approve the presence of NYPD.” According to the suit, Shafik overrode the senate yet again to facilitate the second wave of arrests on April 30. Aside from allowing NYPD on campus for the  first time in 50 years, the lawsuit asserts that Columbia breached New York’s landlord tenant laws for attempting to evict Curran-Groome and Parisi with only a 24-hour notice, rather than the 30-day period  stipulated in New York State law. “The eviction was one of the most heinous aspects of the university’s leveraging our basic rights in order to coerce us into a disciplinary process,” said Curran-Groome. While both plaintiffs held off eviction—with one moving out after two months and the other leaving university housing at the end of the academic term—Curran-Groome laments that the evictions “added inhumane levels of stress for us as two financially independent, working-class students, who had no alternative housing in the city.” Another violation that the lawsuit identifies is the university’s choice to subject students to “interim suspensions” without due process rights. Rather than disciplining students through the University Judicial Board, which, according to Carlson, is designed to conduct transparent and fair hearings, Columbia inappropriately opted to use the Center for Student Success and Intervention, which he says was created in 2021 to handle “offenses like plagiarism and theft.” Carlson explains that “according to CSSI’s own guidelines, hearings are supposed to be offered promptly after issuing interim suspensions, but in practice, the university has used this mechanism to suspend the students indefinitely.” Rather than merely being barred from campus, Curran-Groome lost her housing, healthcare, meal plan, full scholarship, and employment. Parisi was similarly deprived of financial aid and healthcare after being evicted, which they depended on for critical medical treatments. “Columbia does not care whether or not we ‘broke the rules.’ What the lawsuit demonstrates is that the one that actually broke the rules…was the university itself,” said Curran-Groome. “What the university cared about was protecting its bottom line and preventing the student movement from activating the consciousness of the broader student body through the historically and morally righteous cause that we were advocating for: the end of a genocide and our university’s funding of it.” Curran-Groome, et al. v. Columbia University is not the first lawsuit against the school since campus tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza erupted. On April 25, 2024, Palestine Legal filed a civil rights  complaint with the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. The complaint alleges that Palestinian students and their allies have faced discriminatory treatment from the university, including death threats, doxxing, Islamophobia, and more. Sasha Abramsky Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Branko Marcetic Curran-Groome was also one of the victims of the apparent campus  chemical attack, perpetrated by two Israeli students who sprayed a chemical agent at a Gaza solidarity rally in January 2024. The plaintiff was hospitalized and suffered, according to the lawsuit media advisory, “mental and physical trauma from the attack.” One of the two students who carried out the alleged attack  sued Columbia in April, resulting in the termination of his suspension and a  $395,000 settlement payout. “I feel betrayed by an institution that was supposed to support me,” said Curran-Groome. Columbia will be served this week and has 20 days to respond to the lawsuit. Carlson is hopeful that this case may help usher in an era where universities must “think twice before persecuting students for their viewpoints.” Parisi adds that, despite Columbia’s predilection for “profiting from colonial violence” and imposing censorious disciplinary charges, the students “refuse to be intimidated.” “Columbia must remember that the most natural reaction to repression is resistance,” said Curran-Groome. She adds that amid Trump’s executive order and the Gaza ceasefire, which, she says, liberals have used to pretend the genocide is over, the plaintiffs will not permit Columbia to “ignore the harm done to us, and most importantly the harm done to the people of Palestine with our  university’s investments. This lawsuit is a major recourse in our attempts to hold our university accountable and we will not stop. We will not rest.” Lara-Nour Walton is a journalist based in New York.

Activate your online access The party faces a choice: Will it embrace the grassroots energy behind its newly elected leadership? Or allow Trump and his corporate allies to tighten their grip on the country? Grassroots action: Our Revolution at the Democratic National Committee leadership election on Saturday. In a stunning upset against the Democratic establishment, Ken Martin—the Minnesota state party leader—won the race to be the new chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on the first ballot on Saturday. Jane Kleeb—an Our Revolution founding board member and climate activist—was elected to serve as the president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs and vice chair of the party. These victories are a grassroots triumph against the political establishment—Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries—and their billionaire benefactors, who were all aligned behind Ben Wikler, the other top candidate in the chair race. Martin beat Wikler by nearly two to one, despite his opponent’s being bankrolled by LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman and George Soros, who in the past has propped-up Third Way, the Center for American Progress and other “centrist” organizations working to silence populist voices. Since Bernie’s first presidential run in 2016, grassroots activists have demanded a party that fights unapologetically for working people—and with this leadership shift, the base has finally made its voice heard. Martin, Kleeb and other newly elected DNC officers promise the end of the corporate influence that has corrupted the party for decades. But it’s up to the grassroots to hold the new Democratic leadership accountable. The decades-long dependence on billionaires has fundamentally undermined the Democratic Party’s credibility as an opposition party. Democrats claimed to be the party of the working class—while still taking money from the same elites who rig the system. If the party is serious about becoming a true opposition force, it must now fully commit to a grassroots fundraising model—one that rejects corporate influence and restores faith in its ability to fight for working-class Americans. Our Revolution recently surveyed over 5,000 of our most active supporters, and only 14 percent said they were confident that Democratic leaders could effectively counter Trump and his agenda. Nearly nine in 10 called for Democratic politicians to reject corporate money and influence, yet 12 percent have already given up on the party entirely. This growing frustration is evident in comments from grassroots activists. One supporter put it bluntly: “The Democratic Party needs to stop playing nice and fight fire with fire. I’m sick and disgusted today. I am ashamed of our country and the fact that there is no real plan to overhaul the Democratic Party.” Another echoed a common sentiment: “I am not motivated to give Democrats money because I don’t think they know how to fight effectively, and I don’t trust them to do what is necessary to effect real change.” The message is clear: The Democratic base is done with half-measures. Our members voted and said unequivocally that they want the new leadership to commit to this agenda: While Democrats regroup, Trump is wasting no time rewarding the oligarchs who bankrolled his campaign. His administration has already rolled back Biden-era environmental protections, ramped up fossil fuel production, and gutted regulations on Big Tech—all policies that serve the interests of both the oil industry and Silicon Valley’s AI and cryptocurrency expansion. Trump has also launched a systematic effort to consolidate power, purging career civil servants and replacing them with industry executives and political loyalists. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy now serve corporate interests rather than the public good. Simultaneously, Trump and his billionaire allies are tightening their grip over our public square. His administration’s attacks on the press, combined with Big Tech’s increasing dominance over digital discourse, are fragmenting public debate and enabling the spread of misinformation. Companies like Palantir are expanding state surveillance, further eroding civil liberties. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Perhaps most dangerous is Trump’s decision to pardon January 6 insurrectionists, which threatens to normalize political violence and embolden extremist groups. The United States is moving closer to the authoritarian model seen in Russia, India, China, and Hungary (what I call the “RICH” block—where oligarchs use their political power to enrich themselves behind a façade of democracy—or in the case of China, communism). President Biden, in his farewell address on January 15, issued a stark warning: “An oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our democracy.” Days later, his words became reality as Trump took the oath of office, flanked by the oil and tech oligarchs who propelled him to power. This moment marked the beginning of a new political alignment—one where corporate and state power are fused together in a way that threatens the very foundation of American democracy. The Democratic Party now faces a choice: Will it embrace the grassroots energy that fueled Martin and Kleeb’s victory and fight for the working class? Or will it continue to waver, allowing Trump and his corporate allies to tighten their grip on the country? This is the party’s last chance to prove that it stands for the people. If Democrats fail to act boldly now, they risk becoming an irrelevant opposition—while Trump’s authoritarian oligarchy cements its control. The grassroots has spoken. Now the party must listen.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The world’s richest man now has the power to override congressional spending decisions and access to private information about every US taxpayer. Elon Musk, often described as Donald Trump’s shadow president, has quickly morphed into something much more dangerous: Trump’s co-autocrat. Hitherto, Trump’s biggest threat to American democracy came when he incited the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The event was typically Trump in that it was lurid, violent, theatrical, and televised. January 6, like Trump’s first term, demonstrated that he had the ability to menace democratic norms and spur on mayhem—but not to really control the ultimate operation of government. For his second term, Trump has tried to make amends for that failure by recruiting true believers who share his passion for subduing the government, including running roughshod over the system of checks and balance. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who specializes in taking over large companies and remaking them in his image, has been Trump’s most important ally in this agenda, acting as considerably more than an aide. In truth, Musk is emerging as a government within the government, using the time-honored revolutionary tactic of developing dual power in order to seize control. On Sunday, the Financial Times reported that Musk vowed to unilaterally cancel hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of government grants after apparently gaining access to review the US Treasury’s vast payments system, a move that prompted the sudden resignation of one of the department’s most senior officials. The world’s richest man, who bankrolled Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and was tasked by the president with running the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, boasted on his social media site X that he was “rapidly shutting down…illegal payments” after a list of grants to Lutheran organisations was posted online. This is a remarkable power grab on Musk’s part, because he’s a private citizen who is still overseeing his vast fortune even as he claims authority to unilaterally slash government funding. Further, Musk is doing this on behalf of DOGE, which The New York Times accurately describes as “the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.” In fact, DOGE is not a real department authorized by Congress but merely the fiat creation of an executive order signed by Trump. DOGE is an advisory group that is usurping power the Constitution grants to Congress alone. Last week, Trump issued a memo to freeze federal funding for government programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, only to retreat in the face of both popular protest and an adverse court decision. Under the Constitution, Congress alone has the power of the purse, while the president is obligated to “faithfully execute the laws.” Trump’s attempt to arrogate the power to not spend money already allocated by Congress thus constitutes “impoundment”—a practice forbidden by long-standing practices and court decisions. Waleed Shahid, a Democratic Party strategist and member of The Nation’s editorial board, distilled with bracing clarity the breathtaking scope of Musk’s power grab: Not with tanks in the streets or militias at government buildings, but with spreadsheets, executive orders, and a network of loyalists embedded in the federal bureaucracy. In just the past few days, Musk’s hand-picked agents have seized control of Treasury’s 6 trillion payment system, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the General Services Administration (GSA)—institutions that, together, function as the central nervous system of the U.S. government…. In any other country, experts would call it state capture, a textbook coup. Because Musk and his DOGE minions have strong-armed their way into the offices of the Treasury, OPM, GSA, and USAID, they have access to an astonishing body of public data. Musk can, for example, find the Social Security number of any American citizen and also what funds (if any) they receive from the government. Musk is currently targeting mainstream Protestant churches involved in immigration resettlement. On X, the social media site he owns, Musk went after Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, DC, who delivered a sermon calling for compassion to immigrants at a service Trump attended. Musk retweeted a claim that Episcopal Migration Ministries received $53 million for immigration resettlement and said, “She’s on the take.” There is a strong element of political theater in this smearing of Budde, as in Musk’s attack on the Lutheran church. Government funding of social programs run by religious organizations is a long-standing practice and already a matter of public record. But Musk is trying to create the illusion that he’s uncovered a deeply buried government secret. What’s scandalous is Musk’s nebulous status as both a private citizen and presidential crony, which has allowed him access to data that that can easily be abused. Coming from Silicon Valley, Musk knows that data is power. Now, he has access to the full data set of the federal government, which he is both hoarding to himself and preventing the public from seeing (many government websites have already been shuttered, allegedly as a temporary measure during the Trump/Musk riorganizzazione, including those with public health information and Census data). Most disturbingly, Musk and his DOGE team have no proper congressional authorization. As University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket notes: Elon Musk is not a federal employee, nor has he been appointed by the President nor approved by the Senate to have any leadership role in government. The “Department of Government Efficiency,” announced by Trump in a January 20 executive order, is not truly any sort of government department or agency, and even the executive order uses quotes in the title. It’s perfectly fine to have a marketing gimmick like this, but DOGE does not have power over established government agencies, and Musk has no role in government. It does not matter that he is an ally of the President. Musk is a private citizen taking control of established government offices. That is not efficiency; that is a coup. The end goal of the coup is to give Trump and Musk control over the spigot of Treasury spending: in other words, control over the heart of the federal government that ensures the flow of money. In a post on Monday morning, economist Nathan Tankus assembled alarming reporting that makes clear Musk and his DOGE team are working toward control of Treasury’s computer network system. Tankus spells out the new power this would give Trump and Musk: Without political control of the payment’s heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, they could possibly not need agency cooperation. They can just impound agency payments themselves. They could also possibly stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about. Is anyone prepared to end this coup? In an earlier post, Tankus noted that describing an action as unconstitutional does little good if the system of checks and balances breaks down. Paraphrasing Joseph Stalin’s famous quip about the powerlessness of moral leaders such as the pope, Tankus asks, “…and how many divisions does the Constitution have?” There are likely to be court challenges, some of which will roll back parts of Musk’s coup. But the courts are a fickle—and in any case nondemocratic—remedy. Musk’s abuse of power is a massive encroachment on congressional power, but there is little reason to expect Congress will fight back. Congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be abjectly servile to Trump, which makes remedies such as impeachment moot. Nor do Democrats at this moment have any fighting spirit. Instead, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has adopted the stance that it is best to keep the Democrats’ powder dry for future battles. Schumer told The New York Times, “We’re not going to go after every single issue. We are picking the most important fights and lying down on the train tracks on those fights.” It’s a bit distressing that even in this fantasy scenario, Schumer is not imagining rallying the public to counter Trump’s destruction of democracy. Instead, Schumer daydreams about Democrats tying themselves to the metaphorical train tracks, which he apparently believes (all evidence to the contrary) will excite the mercy of the Republicans to stop the train. This is the dream life of the willfully self-defeating—people whose only hope is that the bully will at some point get tired of beating them up. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin More vigorous elements of the Democratic coalition haven’t given up the right. The grassroots group Indivisible notes, The rules of the Senate are designed to protect the rights of the minority, and Democrats have tools at their disposal to grind Senate business to a halt if Republicans try to ram through Trump’s extremist agenda. The three biggest weapons? Blanket opposition, quorum calls, and blocking unanimous consent—parliamentary guerrilla tactics that can slow, stall, and obstruct at every turn. Schumer is not entirely wrong to believe that Democrats need to pick their battles. My normal preference would be to focus on economic fights, which will emerge quickly enough as Trump’s tariff wars drive up inflation. But Musk’s coup is an economic matter as well an attack on the Constitution. Having the world’s richest man gain privileged access to government data, which he will then unilaterally use to slash spending, is the very embodiment of oligarchy. By making Musk’s coup a fighting issue, Democrats have a chance to appeal to the distrust of centralized power and wealth that spans the political spectrum. Polling shows the public is increasingly souring on Musk, who has a net approval rating of minus 16 percent (36 percent favorable, 52 percent unfavorable). It’s unlikely that very many Americans want Musk to have their personal information. If inflation ticks up, going after the super-wealthy who are self-dealing as Trump cronies will become an even more effective line of attack. A political party looking to turn around its own low approval numbers would do well to ferociously attack Musk now as a plutocrat destroying democracy.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Chicago’s years of organizing against immigration raids are a blueprint for real resistance to Trump’s attacks—as even his top goons acknowledge. Trump “border czar” Tom Homan on CNN on January 27, 2025. During an interview on CNN last week, Tom Homan, Donald Trump’s so-called “border czar,” made a big admission. Apparently, the residents of Chicago are making it too damn hard for ICE to enact Trump’s mass deportation plan. “Chicago, very well educated,” Homan whined. “They’ve been educated how to defy ICE, on how to hide from ICE. They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it how to escape from ICE.” Homan’s comments do more than unintentionally boost my city’s local pride. They also implicitly acknowledge both the power of collective resistance and the fact that one of the most potent weapons we have in our campaign against Trump’s deportation campaign is a basic knowledge of our fundamental rights. Chicago is providing evidence in real time that when communities band together, we can defy and frustrate even the most aggressive Trump policies and the armed minions sent to enact them—all without so much as throwing a single punch. In many instances, all it takes is simply refusing to open a door. This is especially true for people in industries like hospitality, where undocumented workers are disproportionately employed in cities across the United States. As the executive director of a group that organizes Chicago’s hospitality workers, I know that our restaurants, bars, and hotels rely on the labor, culture, creativity, and resilience of immigrants, many of whom are undocumented. For them and their families, Trump and Homan’s bluster has evoked a familiar dread—a return to the family separations, workplace raids, and neighborhood crackdowns that defined Trump’s first term and, before that, the Obama years during which Homan was first appointed and honored with a Presidential Rank Award by President Obama. Targeting these members of our communities is neither new nor unique to Trump, with even Democrats like Senator Chris Murphy gloating that Joe Biden was better at mass deportations than Trump has been so far, but history offers powerful lessons in how workers can organize to protect one another and resist state violence. Organized resistance to immigration enforcement in the United States has deep roots, from the Underground Railroad to the present. Our current movements to subvert inhumane, racist immigration laws are directly tied to the 1980s, when US-backed violence and economic deprivation in Central America displaced millions of people. The Reagan administration denied asylum to the overwhelming majority of refugees. In response, churches, workers, and grassroots activists built the modern sanctuary movement, providing shelter and support to those fleeing violence. This underground network shielded thousands and reshaped public debate, challenging the US government’s role in fomenting the violence driving migration and the responsibility to shelter refugees that US foreign policy had, in part, created. Hospitality workers have long played a vital role in sanctuary movements. Bars, restaurants, and hotels have been crucial spaces for organizing and mutual aid, and many hospitality workers have collaborated discreetly with advocacy groups to connect undocumented colleagues and their families with legal and financial aid while shielding them from detection. The hospitality industry is fundamentally about creating spaces where people feel safe and valued. This ethos extends beyond customers to include our coworkers. Mutual aid, a practice rooted in solidarity and collective support, is how we uphold this ethos when systemic failures expose our most vulnerable colleagues to harm. When the state targets immigrant workers, it is not just an attack on individuals; it is an assault on the core principles of what it means to be hospitable. At the same time, the hospitality industry has long relied upon the exploitation of these same individuals. Low wages and wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and rampant harassment are common in the industry. Undocumented workers, in particular, are vulnerable to this abuse, with their immigration status often weaponized—either implicitly or explicitly—by owners and managers to silence complaints or deny basic rights. It is in this context that worker solidarity is crucial. We must demand that our industry begin paying its enormous debt to our most exploited and vulnerable coworkers, emphasizing that building solidarity against everyday workplace abuse and against state violence are one and the same task. Solidarity cannot be simply rhetorical; it must be action-based and grounded in strategic preparation that builds on lessons from the past. During the Obama administration, for example, when deportations reached historic highs and earned Barack Obama the title of “deporter in chief,” rapid-response networks emerged in cities across the country. Volunteers stationed themselves outside courthouses and workplaces to monitor ICE activity, while encrypted messaging apps and text alerts helped families evade arrest. Hospitality workers proved to be critical actors, often offering refuge and support to undocumented colleagues. In Chicago, where thousands of undocumented workers are employed in the hospitality sector, many bars and restaurants quietly ensured that their undocumented employees could rely on their workplaces as spaces of safety. This was again evident during the nationwide ICE raids initiated under Trump in the summer of 2019. Activists in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York mobilized quickly. Know-your-rights workshops empowered people to utilize legal protections, while neighborhood groups distributed information door to door. On the days of the raids, coordinated efforts kept many communities on high alert, and mutual aid funds helped families weather the economic fallout of detentions. Hospitality workers were often key participants in these efforts, providing safe spaces in kitchens, basements, and backrooms while alerting community networks to ICE activity. Although enormous harm was still perpetrated, these actions significantly blunted the raids’ intended impact. The same is happening again today, as progressive owners, managers, and workers have quickly organized themselves—something I know from the requests my organization has received for support, the firsthand accounts of workers, and the wide distribution of know-your-rights materials. What unites these efforts is an ethos of collective care and solidarity. Even against the immense power of federal agencies, communities have shown they can build protective networks that shield the vulnerable and disrupt state violence. This is not to minimize the very real harm inflicted by deportations but to highlight how grassroots movements have played a key part in restraining the state’s ability to enact unchecked cruelty. As the country braces for the ongoing threat of ICE raids and mass arrests, these histories offer a road map—and a reminder that it’s we all have the power to try to stop these attacks. We’re not helpless. We know what works. Preparation is key. Resistance begins long before ICE agents arrive. Legal organizations and advocacy groups must aggressively promote know-your-rights education opportunities and ensure that cost-free resources are accessible in multiple languages. Communities can organize defense teams to monitor ICE activity and provide immediate support. Churches, libraries, and other trusted spaces can reaffirm their roles as sanctuaries, both symbolically and materially. Hospitality industry workers can ensure that our workplaces provide spaces of safety and solidarity for undocumented colleagues by collectively reviewing strategies for response if and when ICE shows up. If ICE shows up at your restaurant, bar, or hotel, there are critical steps workers can take to protect ourselves and our colleagues. First, remain calm and avoid volunteering any information. Notify all staff immediately, prioritizing clear and calm communication, and avoid creating panic. Utilize encrypted messaging apps or other secure methods to alert community defense networks. Document the encounter by noting agents’ names, badge numbers, and actions, but do not physically interfere. Workers have the right to remain silent and should not answer questions about their immigration status or provide information about others. Neither you nor business owners or managers should hand over identification or any papers to ICE, nor should you give them any false documents or information. You can instead simply state, “I am exercising my right to remain silent,” and decline to answer any questions, or you can request to speak to a lawyer and say no more. Immigration agents may enter private areas of a workplace only with a judicial warrant signed by a judge, not just an administrative warrant (despite the fact that ICE agents will claim otherwise). If they attempt to enter, ask to see the warrant and verify its details, ensuring that it is properly signed with “US District Court” or that a state court is named at the top of the document and specifies the areas ICE seeks to access. If agents lack a valid warrant, you have the right to deny them entry to nonpublic areas. Ensure that know-your-rights materials are readily available to distribute to any targeted workers. Lastly, coordinate with local advocacy and mutual aid organizations to provide legal, financial, and emotional support in the aftermath of enforcement actions. Mutual aid is indispensable to this whole process. I have seen firsthand how mutual aid transforms fear into action. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when my coworkers and I founded The CHAAD Project to organize Chicago’s hospitality workers, mutual aid networks flourished. As workers were abandoned en masse by our employers, we joined together to share critical information on labor violations, unemployment assistance, and other essential resources, prioritizing those among us in greatest need and those later excluded from government relief, including undocumented people. We must build on these experiences and networks now, mobilizing as a community to provide bail funds, legal support, and material aid to families affected by deportations. Solidarity from outside the hospitality industry and immigrant community is equally crucial. Diverse labor unions have long stood with undocumented workers. In 2006, for example, when ICE raided meatpacking plants in the Midwest, unionized workers staged walkouts, demonstrating the power of collective action. Such support matters just as much now. Public visibility is another vital tool. During the first Trump administration, viral videos of ICE raids and family separations sparked widespread outrage and forced policymakers to confront the human cost of enforcement. As arrests resume, documenting and publicizing these actions can again galvanize resistance. Collective efforts to stop arrests and deportation of our immigrant neighbors do more than protect targeted individuals. They build enduring community power and give neighbors and coworkers reason to have confidence in one another. Every neighborhood defense team and mutual aid network strengthens the fabric of solidarity, fostering cultures of care that extend beyond moments of crisis. By circumventing deportations, communities weaken the broader politics of fear and division that fuel these policies. Chicagoans are refusing to simply submit to cruel policies and obey oppressive federal authorities—and as Homan’s complaining shows, our tactics are working. But if we fail to condemn, resist, and subvert state violence, or become complacent and resigned over time, we will fuel the intensification and expansion of state violence against immigrants and, increasingly, anyone who falls afoul of police and authoritarian power. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin The Trump administration’s renewed deportation plans are a grave threat, but they are neither unprecedented nor insurmountable. Our own history as workers reminds us that collective action can disrupt such plans and turn campaigns of hate into engines for solidarity, care, and community. The hospitality industry thrives on connection and care; these values guide our resistance. When we stand together—whether by turning restaurants into sanctuaries or organizing mutual aid networks—we redefine what it means to be hospitable. Our power as workers lies not just in the meals we serve or the rooms we prepare but in the communities we create and defend. By resisting the targeting of our coworkers, we both protect one another and move closer to building truly hospitable workplaces free of abuse and exploitation.

Activate your online access Now is the time to ask your community what they need—to connect and build power wherever you can. Tori Furtado, from Boston, kneels down to write a sign that reads, “Love has no borders,” in front of the Chinatown Gate, where hundreds gathered for a rally before marching to the State House in a demonstration against President Trump’s new immigration order the day after it was issued, January 28, 2017. It was one of the coldest and darkest mornings Brooklyn has had all winter. As erratic as our weather patterns have been, no one expected the icy temperatures to arrive so suddenly. There are some of us who sneakily love the inconvenience of it all—me included. But on this particular morning, I was not snuggled up on the couch, withdrawing from the world and relishing the irresistible disruption to mundane life. I was at the post office. The mood at the post office felt much different from my last time there just a week before. After a week of extremist and unconstitutional executive orders that touched nearly every aspect of people’s everyday lives, everyone, myself included, seemed to be holding on to so much more than their boxes, bills, and birthday cards. I gripped my parcels tighter as I thought about the state of the world, starting in this bare-bones post office. Those around me represented a cross section of people from all different walks of life experiencing the same structural failures. We went to bed dreading the same threats to our trans friends and family and to our undocumented neighbors. We woke up uncertain about the future, as we watched grocery prices climb and devastating wildfires ravage places we love. I studied their faces and watched them stand uncomfortably in line, probably sweating under heaping layers of winter attire, like me. Their eyes glazed over, resisting any quiver of muscle that wanted permission to let go. That grinding mix of exhaustion, lost will, or lost hope. What are we going to do about all of this grief? I wondered. How do we move over the edge knowing that what we face is bigger than what any individual can handle alone? I let out a sigh of relief when I finally reached the counter. As I walked toward the exit, I noticed a young woman standing by the exit. Her long black hair was combed back in a ponytail, and her face was fresh without makeup. She held a piece of paper in her hand and eagerly looked at each person who walked by her, hoping to catch their eye. Next to her was a large stroller, overly stuffed with her family’s belongings, and a young child, who was perhaps no more than a year old. With remarkable persistence, he tried to stand on his stroller, his arms reaching out to her as she lovingly rubbed his back and continued to focus on what she needed to do. In some ways, he reminded me of my own daughter when she was that age. “¿Habla español?” she asked me. “No, sorry,” I said, waving my hand as if it were necessary to further signal my dismissal. As I took a few more steps toward the door, I paused, stunned by the way I had spoken to the woman. I turned around and walked over to her, pulling out my phone and typing away on Google Translate. I showed her my phone. “Quiero ayudarte,” it read. I want to help you. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Carolina (a pseudonym) needed to change her mailing address. As part of New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s decision to close more emergency migrant shelters, Carolina’s family—her, her husband, and son—had recently moved from the now-closed Floyd Bennett Field encampment, which housed hundreds of migrant families in Brooklyn, to a hotel in Queens. For the next two hours, I helped Carolina navigate the long process, all the more so as she didn’t have a valid ID. We stood in that corner of the post office, using Google Translate as a go-between as we exchanged messages and inquisitive looks, struggling to understand and be understood. Meanwhile, her child was starting to stir, getting increasingly frustrated sitting in his stroller. In an attempt to get his mother’s attention, he dropped his bag of animal crackers on the floor. She picked it up, and he dropped it again. “Uh oh!” someone said. The voice belonged to an older woman. She picked up the bag of crackers and handed it to the toddler. She looked at both me and Carolina, and winked at us as if to say, “Keep going, I can keep him entertained.” As Carolina and I continued to sort out the complicated and mundane process of an address change, the woman played “peek-a-boo” with the child, who responded each time with full belly laughter that could melt a mother’s heart and even a stranger’s. Several people in the post office were watching us now. Once Carolina and I got all of her information together, we returned to the line. A man at the front waved at us, offering his place. We gladly took his spot. When we got to the counter, the postal worker and I exchanged glances—it was clear that she, too, had been watching me help Carolina, along with the older woman who played with her son, and the man in line who let us breeze by him. “You may get some pushback because she doesn’t have an ID,” the clerk said. “But here…” We watched her scribble a phone number and name on a piece of paper. “Have her call this office, and ask for this supervisor, and be sure to let him know that she was living in a shelter. He will help,” she said. I typed the instructions into Google Translate, and showed it to Carolina, who nodded her head both at me and the clerk. Carolina and I said a short goodbye. I squeezed her shoulder and wished her well. I held my finger out to her son, who grabbed it with his chubby hand and shook it as he smiled brightly at me. As I walked out the door, I couldn’t help but think about what had just occurred. All of us in the post office seemed to be so focused on our own world, trying to find ways to cope with any number of concerns but forgetting how over time our efforts to push down our feelings actually stifle them, moving us to a place of reactivity, and disconnection from the world, ourselves, and our power. We are led to believe that not only are we alone in this world, but also that nothing can or will change, which allows the darkness to cloud our ability to see each other. But what also struck me was not just the lack of connection but what happens when we do connect. There had been a chain reaction that morning. A few of us found purpose and belonging in small moments of tenderness and connection. It was proof that the society we dream of is already here, but it requires us to choose it. In such trying times, love in itself can feel like it’s not enough. We find ourselves surrendering to the idea that the chaos in front of us is much too big for any feeling like love to take it on. But we must not forget its power. For generations, love has strengthened families and friendships, pointed us toward solutions within our schools and workplaces, and given us the courage to take risks that can help the greater good. In history, it has been at the core of every victory and transformation, both big and small. It can serve as a reminder that sometimes, we do win—and we have to keep going. We know how to get through this dark period because we’ve done this many times before. We have the blueprints of those who came before us. Civil rights giants like Fannie Lou Hamer and John Lewis, but also everyday people who gathered—in our communities and in our families—to put their skills, experience, and hope on the table, envision new possibilities, and take action. Through their work, we have learned that the quality of connection inside each pair, group, or community is what makes transformation possible. This wisdom is the torch we must use to light our way through the darkness. This is how we have always navigated toward the future. We are here in this present moment, with headlines making us feel as if we are all flailing in the unknown—petrified, overwhelmed, and unsure. While the last decade has transformed how we engage with the work of justice and share visions of what our world can be, it has been rough. Liberation is no small task. For the past 10 years, I’ve been drawn to organizing, searching for belonging and meaning and a way out of the feeling of futility. In this time, I have planned nationwide protests, local vigils and talking circles in living rooms across the country. And through it all, being with people helped me realize that I wasn’t alone. It helped me see the raw power that can emerge when we come together. The kind of power that makes change possible. This moment calls on us to adapt, gather our wisdom, and go even deeper. Because the kind of change we are after is not only institutional but also cellular. It is personal, deep, and intimate. It is how we listen to our own heartbeats, ask our neighbors what they need, and connect with ourselves and each other. We must be careful not to mislabel or downplay our acts of love and the way they will impact our communities. In fact, love-driven work is a willful act, a choice to hold dear what we value, and a much more powerful place from which to organize. With ICE raids happening across the country, I have thought so much about Carolina and her family. I have wondered where she is, and if her family is safe. And as I hold my own daughters at night, I hope and I pray that she’s holding her child, too. It is our turn to carry the world with purpose, to build not from left to right but from the bottom up. In a time that seeks to ostracize so many of us, our diverse, vibrant communities are still here—and we aren’t going anywhere. Let’s continue to listen to our hearts, hold each other tight, connect, and build power. This is our moment to fight against the darkness and emerge into the light—whether in the frustrating long lines at the post office, in our homes, with our communities, or wherever we can find the strength to illuminate others. The light, after all, has always been ours to give. Adrianne Wright is the founder and CEO of Rosie, a storytelling agency for nonprofits.

        "title": "Joe Biden’s Indictment | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The former president’s unexpectedly powerful farewell address rightly condemned the very oligarchy he empowered. Joe Biden unexpectedly saved the best for last. No one ever accused the former president of being an outstanding orator. In his last two years in office, he was increasingly halting and confused in his public speeches. But on January 15, less than a week before his successor was sworn in, Biden delivered an outstanding farewell address—one that should be especially welcomed by progressives and liberals. The first part of the speech was taken up by expressing Biden’s deep commitment to American democracy and pluralism. He also outlined the achievements of his administration, with an emphasis on rebuilding the economy. This boasting was understandable: Although there is much in Biden’s record to criticize, he has launched the largest public spending on social policy in generations and invested serious money in tackling climate change. With Trump returning to the White House, Biden performed a necessary service by celebrating a progressive economic vision that serves as both an alternative to Trumpism and a launching pad for future Democratic administrations. But the real meat of Biden’s speech came not from his laundry list of accomplishments but his dark foreboding about the threats to American democracy. Biden warned: “Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead. We see the consequences all across America.” Biden compared this oligarchy to the robber barons of the 19th century. Those robber barons eventually provoked a popular reaction leading to trust busting and progressive taxation. Specifying the nature of this oligarchy, Biden cited one of the most famous of all farewell addresses, Dwight Eisenhower’s 1961 warning of “the dangers of the military-industrial complex.” Quoting Eisenhower, Biden raised the specter of “the disastrous rise of misplaced power.” The new concern, Biden advised, was “the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well.” Thanks to the tech lords, “Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power.” Biden also insisted that “the existential threat of climate change has never been clearer. Just look across the country, from California to North Carolina.” These are all wise words—ones that Democrats should heed as they rebuild their shattered party. Yet Biden’s speech was double-edged, serving not just as a preemptive strike against the coming abuses of the Trump administration but also, if we are honest, as a rebuke to Biden’s own record. In warning of oligarchy, Biden sounded as if he had suddenly shed his lifelong identity as a milquetoast centrist and been possessed by the spirit of Bernie Sanders. Indeed, the Vermont Senator himself seemed aware of this fact. The following day, Sanders grilled billionaire Scott Bessen, Trump’s nominee to be treasury secretary, and quoted Biden’s admonishment about oligarchy. Bessen tartly noted that Biden gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom “to two people who would qualify as oligarchs.” Alas, Bessen had a point. Biden did in fact give the nation’s highest civilian honor to two billionaires, George Soros and David Rubenstein, both examples of the outsize power of money in American democracy. The award to Rubenstein is particularly egregious, since he is a crony capitalist who has built his fortune thanks to close ties to government officials. To reformulate Bessen’s retort: If you talk the talk, you have to walk the walk. You can’t talk like Bernie Sanders if you’re actually Joe Biden—the “senator from MBNA” who has been cozying up to plutocrats his entire life. Speaking to wealthy donors in 2019, then-candidate Biden reassured them that he planned no large tax hikes. Under his presidency, “no one’s standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.” In other words, Biden was never a threat to the oligarchy. The same contradiction between words and actions applies to Biden’s caution about a “tech-industrial complex.” In a speech delivered to the State Department the same day as his farewell address, Biden boasted about all the new spending on military technology undertaken by his administration as part of a program of military Keynesianism. Biden crowed: We’ve increased our military power, making the most significant investments in the Defense Industrial Base in decades. We’ve increased the technology power, taking the lead on artificial intelligence and other technologies of the future…. We’ve also significantly strengthened the defense industrial base, investing almost $1.3 trillion in procurement and research and development. In real dollars, that’s more than America did in any four-year period during the Cold War. If the “tech-industrial complex” is a new manifestation of the military-industrial complex, then Biden has immeasurably strengthened its grip on our economy and our politics. It is public funding that is making tech lords like Elon Musk (who has billions in government contracts) stronger. Once again, Biden is the architect of the very oligarchy he decries. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin There’s a further contradiction in fighting the existential threat posed by climate change while pushing for renewed great-power competition with China—as Biden has done. Any real climate solution will require international cooperation, not economic nationalism. Biden’s parting rebuke to oligarchy is welcome. But if Biden wants to see why plutocracy now threatens America, he needs to begin by looking in the mirror.

        "title": "CNN Surrenders to Trump | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The corporate media’s commitment to fighting autocracy proves fickle. CNN anchor Jim Acosta is fated to be a barometer of his network’s relationship with Donald Trump. During Trump’s first term, Acosta’s tough questioning at press conferences gave CNN credibility as a news outlet uncowed by the president’s bullying and willing to uphold the principle of accountability. In 2018, Trump denounced Acosta as a “rude, terrible person” and the White House revoked Acosta’s press pass. CNN sued Trump and his top aides on behalf of Acosta, successfully forcing the White House to give the reporter back his press pass. If Acosta’s jousting with Trump was once celebrated by CNN, it has now become a source of shame. With Trump winning not just a second term but also having, for the first time, a popular vote victory (however narrow), CNN and other corporate media outlets have been thoroughly cowed. Last Thursday in the newsletter Status, Oliver Darcy, a former CNN journalist, reported that CNN CEO Mark Thompson had phoned Acosta and “delivered the veteran journalist a sudden and strange proposal: Move your show to midnight and anchor it until 2am ET.” Acosta currently has a morning show that runs at 10 am ET. A media executive told Darcy, “They want to get rid of Acosta to throw a bone to Trump. Midnight is not a serious offer when his ratings are among the best on the network.” Mediaite followed up Darcy’s reporting with other quotes from current and former CNN employees, who were nearly unanimous in being shocked by the network’s behavior. One staffer said, “Jim made a career and name for himself by asking tough questions and holding power to account. That included Trump. So it will be interesting to see if this kind of move has some sort of chilling effect or sends a message to other shows and EPs about how the network wants to engage with this new administration.” Another interviewee described the staff as “baffled” by the proposed sidelining of Acosta, noting, “It seems like an attempt to appease Trump, who is never appeased by anything.” On Tuesday, Darcy reported that the day before Trump’s inauguration Thompson held a virtual editorial meeting where he offered guidance about how he wanted to see the network cover Inauguration Day. Thompson indicated to attendees, I’m told, that he wanted his journalists to be forward-thinking and to avoid pre-judging Trump. He cautioned against expressing any outrage of their own, as many of the anchors who make up CNN’s roster of journalists had previously done with regularity during Trump’s first term. CNN’s shift mirrors a larger transformation in the corporate media. During Trump’s first term, many outlets found it profitable to cater to popular liberal outrage over Trump. Under the umbrella label of “resistance liberalism” emerged a genuine mass movement that sought to fight Trumpism through protests and electoral organizing. Resistance liberalism had its share of faults—notably a propensity for conspiracy theories evident in the wilder speculations about Trump’s possible ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin—but it was also a salutary popular engagement with democracy. The mainstream media, sometimes cynically but also with genuine investigative reporting, tried to harness the new audience of resistance liberals. In 2017, The Washington Post adopted the slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” But even before Trump won his second term, the fighting spirit of resistance liberalism had waned, weakened by years of defending the often out-of-touch Biden administration. It’s notable that in 2024, roughly 75 percent of the nation’s largest newspapers—including The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Los Angeles Times—refused to endorse any candidate for president. Earlier this month, the Post adopted a new mission statement: “Riveting Storytelling for All of America.” While “Democracy Dies in Darkness” can be criticized for being melodramatic and self-important, the new credo suggests a newspaper not committed to journalism at all but devoted instead to simple entertainment. The retreat from an adversarial relationship to Trump is undoubtedly rooted in economic self-interest. As corporate consolidation of the media intensifies, news outlets are increasingly beholden to leviathan parent entities that are deeply entangled with affairs of the state. This is especially the case since Donald Trump has not been shy about threatening to use his presidential power against business leaders who defy him. Last fall, Trump threatened Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg with life in prison. Not surprisingly, Zuckerberg has swiftly moved to appease Trump by making changes at Facebook that suit the president—notably the site’s recent severe curtailing of fact-checking. The New York Post reports that “CNN’s corporate parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, has made it clear it wants the network to adopt a more neutral tone in its dealings with Trump.” The Washington Post, of course, is owned by Jeff Bezos, one of the world’s richest men, whose extensive business interests, notably at Amazon, require him to keep on the good side of Trump. The abject submission of outlets such as CNN and The Washington Post is not just a lesson in the dangers of corporate control of the media but also a reminder of the value of independent media. The alliance between the mainstream media and resistance liberalism was always precarious and dubious. Even when CNN was more critical of Trump than they are now, it was on grounds friendlier to a safe centrism than any progressive politics: hence CNN’s onetime promotion of Russiagate and incessant elevation of Never Trump Republicans. The lesson progressives should take is that corporate media is never friendly terrain and to build a lasting opposition you need independent outlets such as Democracy Now!, ProPublica, and, dare we say it, The Nation.

Activate your online access We owe it to our forebears, our families, our communities, and future generations to keep fighting for just causes, writes Nina Turner. We, too, shall overcome. Demonstrators march on the 60th anniversary of the March On Washington and Martin Luther King Jr’s historic “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, on August 26, 2023. On Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States of America. Many people are experiencing deep pain, sadness, and fear. These emotions are understandable, as we do not know for certain what the future holds and the present looks increasingly dire. In just a few days, Trump has created untold hardship for people in the US and around the world. But one thing we must not do is fall into despair. We cannot allow fear to take hold of us and control us. As I look back on our nation’s history, I feel optimistic, not because our history is positive and not because our present is good, but because I see the mountains we have scaled and overcome. I have faith that we can come together and confront our challenges, because they did not start with Donald Trump and will not end with his presidency. Today, we wake up in a familiar America, an America where the number-one cause of bankruptcy is medical debt, where 68,000 people die each year due to the lack of healthcare, where the leading cause of death for children is gun violence, where the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, where the rate of those sleeping on the streets is increasing by record numbers each year, where the voice of the people is drowned out politically by the ruling class. Our mission has not changed. Our fight to ensure working-class Americans from all backgrounds have their basic needs met and have the ability to live a good life has not changed. The ruling class who buy elected officials has not changed. Therefore, our pursuit and commitment to just causes have not changed. Our mission remains the same. Moving forward is key. We must not allow ourselves to be overcome by disdain for any one individual. We must love those we are fighting for more than we dislike who we are fighting against. President Donald Trump was sworn in on the same day our nation recognizes the life and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some saw the convergence of these two events as ironic. I saw it as a searing foreshadowing for those of us willing to take up the mantle of Dr. King’s work to create a beloved community. Despite the venom and anti-Black hatred that was directed toward him and the civil rights movement, he never lost sight of the goal. He once declared, “Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” We should live by those words. Collectively, our love for our humanity and the humanity of those around us is a far more powerful force than the collective hatred for one man. Our elected officials and political institutions on the right side of justice and freedom must commit to representing us, not the ruling class. Our demand has not changed. Our love for humanity has not changed. We must not waver. I remain hopeful for the future. We all should. As a Black woman in America, I think about how our ancestors liberated themselves from chattel slavery. Our ancestors defeated Jim Crow laws. We, too, shall overcome. The words of Harriet Tubman weigh heavily with me in this moment: “If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there’s shouting after you, keep going. Don’t ever stop.” We owe it to our forebears, our families, our communities, and future generations to not stop. We must keep going.

Activate your online access Most Americans voted for someone else in 2024, but as New York City’s public advocate said, “We’re going to have to stand together to get through this.” New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams speaks at the People’s March in Washington Square Park in New York City on January 18, 2025. Last Saturday’s anti-Trump People’s March in New York City concluded with a rally in Washington Square Park in the heart of Greenwich Village. The city government’s second-highest-ranking official, Jumaane Williams, began his remarks by recognizing that people were hurting and scared. “We’re facing tough times,” said Williams, a leading figure on the progressive left of New York politics for more than a decade. His demeanor somber but unbowed, he added, “There are hard days ahead.” Williams is New York’s public advocate, an uncommon office in US politics that holds considerable, though often overlooked, potential influence. Notably, the public advocate stands second in the line of succession to the mayor; if the incumbent for any reason can no longer fulfill their duties, the public advocate automatically takes their place. So if current mayor Eric Adams goes down in the federal corruption trial scheduled for April—a distinct possibility—the most populous city in the United States could be led during the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency by Williams, a 48-year-old African American father of two daughters and self-described democratic socialist. “I want everyone here to reach out and take the hand of the person next to you,” Williams told the crowd. “We’re going to have to stand together to get through this.” All of the protesters in this reporter’s line of sight took one another’s hands, if perhaps a bit self-consciously. “Now,” Williams continued, “I want everybody to tell the person whose hand you’re holding, ‘I will stand with you.’” Again with some self-consciousness but also now with a few grins, people near me murmured to each another, “I will stand with you.” “We have to protect everyone” under threat from the Trump regime, Williams added, referencing immigrants, LGBTQ+, Black and brown New Yorkers, working people and youth. “We can make it through if we don’t let go of anyone’s hands.” One of the signs bobbing above the crowd as it marched to Washington Square under chilly, gray skies offered an essential reminder: “49.8 Percent Is Not A Landslide.” Of course, Trump and his allies have been boasting since election night that he won a resounding landslide victory that gives him a popular mandate to implement his radical agenda. Most mainstream news coverage has uncritically repeated that claim. But the claim is false. The official vote tally as monitored by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shows that Trump won only 49.80 percent of the popular vote. The other 50.2 percent went mainly to Kamala Harris, who won 48.33 percent, with the remaining 1.87 percent spread among third-party candidates. In other words, more Americans voted against Trump in 2024 than voted for him. Even in the Electoral College, where his margin was substantial, if a mere 114,884 voters in three states—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—had shifted from Trump to Harris, then Harris, not Trump, would have been the 47th president of the United States. It’s no mystery why Trump wants to be seen as super popular: If people believe that lie, it makes his work easier. Citizens will be less likely to resist, members of Congress even more inclined to submit, and news organizations may think twice before questioning his actions. But math does not lie: The people who did not want Trump to be president are the majority, if only slightly. To disregard that fact undercuts that majority’s considerable power to oppose Trump and his Nazi-saluting allies. The proportion of the anti-Trump majority who turned out for the People’s March in New York, however, was tiny: 1,500 people at most. Turnout was also very low at the main People’s March in Washington, DC., where 25,000 were reportedly in attendance. Those figures are dwarfed by the 1 million–plus protesters who filled the streets of Washington prior to Trump’s first inauguration, in 2017. Sasha Abramsky Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Branko Marcetic “We need to recognize that people are in pain and going through trauma,” Williams told me when asked about the low turnout. It’s wrongheaded, he added, to criticize folks for not showing up at these protests. “We want to pull people in, not push them away. We need to admit to them that the Democratic Party didn’t do what it should have done to prevent Trump from returning to power. And we need to keep giving people pathways to take action.” Uptown in Harlem, one such pathway beckoned the following day when the historic Apollo Theater hosted its nineteenth annual celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday in collaboration with public radio station WNYC. A peerless cathedral of African American song, the Apollo has featured Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, and hundreds of other Black musical giants over the past 90 years. Less known is that the Apollo is also a community center that promotes cultural awareness and political action. Steps from its entrance on 125th Street a commemorative sign marks the spot where a joyous crowd welcomed Nelson Mandela during his triumphant tour of the US in 1990 after the South African anti-apartheid leader was released after 27 years in prison. A recording of Bob Marley’s “Get Up, Stand Up” poured from the Apollo’s loudspeakers as a packed house patiently awaited this year’s program, “A Burning House.” The program title came from a conversation King had with his close friend the singer and activist Harry Belafonte, a week before King was assassinated in 1968. Noting that the war in Vietnam was intensifying while racism remained entrenched despite the civil rights movement’s victories—desegregating restrooms and other public facilities, gaining voting rights—King feared he was integrating Black people into “a burning house.” Belafonte asked what should be done. King replied, “We must become firefighters.” At the People’s March, Williams channeled the sentiments of both King and Mandela: “Lots of us have read about tough periods in history and wondered what we would have done if we were there. Well, in two days [when Trump takes office], we’re there. I think of the generations before me who sacrificed so I could be here. I think of the generations to come who will look back at our generation. We have to shine as bright as we can for them.” Next, a representative of Brooklyn Young Democrats leaned into the point that most Americans don’t agree with Trump—for example, nearly six in 10 oppose pardoning the January 6 insurrectionists, a Reuters/IPSOS poll found—and thus could be swayed by strategic outreach. “We believe that people across political affiliations, from leftists to liberals to centrists and libertarians and even Republicans, don’t want billionaires running our government,” said Carlos Calzadilla-Palacio. “We need to meet people where there are. And working at the local level, individuals can have a real impact.” “Showing up at a march like today might not be your thing,” said the Rev. Amanda Hambrick Ashcraft of Middle Collegiate Church, a multiracial church in New York with the intentionally double-meaning motto, “Just Love.” “That’s fine,” she said, “there are other things that need doing: attending meetings, making phone calls, contacting public officials.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Morocco sentenced the Palestine solidarity activist to prison just for protesting. But the trail of his persecution runs from Israel across the Atlantic to New Jersey and Texas. On November 16, 2024, a 34-year-old Moroccan agricultural engineer appeared at a police station in Casablanca, in response to a summons order issued by local authorities. They proceeded to remand him to detention, and two days later charged him with “incitement to commit miscellaneous crime.” In the preceding months, Ismail Lghazaoui had been working with his local Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) group to protest corporate and state complicity with Israel’s war of annihilation against Palestinians in Gaza. For his efforts, Moroccan police had earlier in October stopped him on the street as he was en route to the United States Consulate to protest against American support for Israel—though he was later released without charge. Following the November arrest, however, prosecutors cited Lghazaoui’s speeches calling for popular mobilizations around the American consulate, which circulated on Arabic-language social media, as the basis for his charges. They further appended to his case file statements he made calling for port workers and protesters to block Israel-bound ships from docking, after local and international investigations revealed that Morocco’s Tanger Med Port was being used to transfer military cargo to Israel. A month later, sitting in jail after his lawyers’ request for provisional release was denied, Lghazaoui received the maximum penalty for his charge: a one-year prison sentence and a $500 fine. Throughout the duration of his trial, and during his present incarceration, Lghazaoui has been held in a solitary cell, with limited access to hygiene supplies, sunlight, and family visits. At first, Lghazaoui’s case appears to be a straightforward story of repression against advocates for Palestine, perpetrated by an Arab government that has long normalized relations with Israel. Yet the complex sequence of events leading up to his arrest run backward from Haifa and Ashdod, through the Strait of Gibraltar, and across the Atlantic Ocean to commercial ports in New Jersey and Texas. Each site represents a crucial node in the unseen engine of the Gaza genocide: the global supply chain that funnels US-made weapons and military cargo to Israel. In early November of last year, the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), in collaboration with Progressive International, published a research report analyzing 2,000 shipments of military cargo sent to the Israeli Ministry of Defense since the start of the genocide, on vessels operated by the Danish logistics giant Maersk. The report found that the shipments—which included millions of pounds worth of armored personnel carriers, military tactical vehicles, armored plates, aircraft parts, bomb assays, and bullet cores—typically departed the United States from ports in New Jersey and Texas before transiting through the Port of Algeciras, Spain on the way to Israel. Most crucially, the report revealed that Maersk had knowingly flouted Spanish law, in effect since May 2024, prohibiting military materiel destined for Israel from transiting through Spanish ports. As a result of the pressure from PYM’s campaign, Maersk was forced to admit publicly for the first time that it was carrying weapons to Israel on behalf of US Foreign Military Sales. In response to these revelations, the Spanish government began denying entry to Maersk vessels suspected of carrying shipments to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. After access to one of its key transshipment hubs was disrupted, Maersk was forced to begin diverting its vessels to a terminal across the Strait of Gibraltar: the Tanger Med Port on the Moroccan coast. While Morocco has long maintained commercial trade relations with Israel, the revelation that the kingdom was directly facilitating the transfer of military cargo to Israeli forces in Gaza sparked widespread outrage across Moroccan civil society. The city of Tangier, in particular, where the Tanger Med Port is located, has witnessed large-scale protests since November over the government’s explicit support for the ongoing genocide. Lghazaoui participated in these popular mobilizations and called for the disruption of military shipments at the port, alongside groups such as BDS Morocco and the Moroccan Front for Palestine and Against Normalization. The severity of Lghazaoui’s prosecution was likely tied to the authorities’ desire to make an example out of a prominent face of the protest movement, after seeing port workers answer civil society’s calls to action. Several workers at Tanger Med Port refused to handle military cargo and were later disciplined or fired, while others resigned from their jobs in protest. After photos leaked showing tactical military vehicles sitting on open container beds in the Maersk terminal, port authorities began limiting access to CCTV and docking ships at night. The port workers’ mobilizations reached a fever pitch with a unionization drive that called on the International Trade Federation for support, but Maersk quashed the fledgling attempt in a letter sent out to port workers. The ongoing crises surrounding Morocco’s role in Israel’s genocide has exacerbated long-simmering tensions between state policies and public sentiment. In Muslim-majority states such as Morocco, where popular support for the Palestinian cause runs high (since the start of the genocide, support for diplomatic relations with Israel has plummeted from 31 to 13 percent), government officials oscillate anxiously between paying lip service to Gaza and glad-handing their American, Israeli, and European patrons. The Moroccan government’s willingness to allow weapons shipments to Israel to pass through its ports, despite the Spanish government’s own refusal to do so, is a logical consequence of the normalization agreement between Israel and Morocco brokered by the previous Trump administration. Morocco’s participation in the 2020 Abraham Accords, which formalized a history of previously discreet diplomatic relations with Israel, bore fruit in the form of intelligence collaborations, joint military exercises, weapons purchases, and US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. In July 2024, the Moroccan military entered into a $1 billion contract with the Israel Aerospace Industries to procure Ofek 13 spy satellites, which Israel has used to surveil Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Lebanon. While street protests offer a kind of pressure-release valve to governments that have normalized relations with Israel, lest civil society mobilizations spiral into larger crises of legitimacy, public expressions of solidarity must be confined to generalized support for Palestinians facing Israel’s apocalyptic military campaign. More confrontational political organizing that takes aim at Morocco’s own complicity in sustaining the genocide is a different matter entirely. In the past year alone, two Moroccan nationals, Said Boukioud and Abderrahmane Azenkad, were given five-year sentences for denouncing Moroccan normalization with Israel on social media. Their cases, like Lghazaoui’s, sought to suppress nationwide opposition by making an example out of public advocates. Across the region, in countries like Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf states, authorities have adopted elastic legal definitions of “incitement,” “cybercrime,” and “terrorism” in order to persecute organizers, journalists, and students for speaking out against their governments’ roles in facilitating Israel’s charnel house. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Lghazaoui’s imprisonment imparts an obligation to people of conscience the world over, a duty that transcends sympathy or sloganeering. His status as a political prisoner is tied to an intricate, global web of collusion with Israel’s genocidal ambitions, knit together by multinational corporations and collaborationist governments. The movement to enact a people’s arms embargo, contra the sclerotic complicity of Western powers and their compradors, must recognize this interconnected reality and work to develop and strengthen institutions of bottom-up, working-class power that can demand and extract true accountability from corporate and state actors, wherever they may be. In a letter from prison written on December 30, 2024, Lghazaoui salutes the “free people who supported me without even truly knowing me,” and to whom he is connected through a “common bond and ultimate goal: to amplify the voice of the Moroccan people rejecting injustice and standing in solidarity with the steadfast Palestinian people.” We must dare to count ourselves among those who are bonded in this struggle for justice—for Lghazaoui, and for Gaza.

        "title": "The Case for Letting Noncitizens Vote | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Measures to allow local noncitizen voting failed in the last election, but that hasn’t always been the case throughout American history. Santa Ana Families for Fair Elections launching a campaign to expand local noncitizen voting in September 2023. Carlos Perea remembers listening to his mother’s stories about dodging immigration raids in Orange County’s textile factories. “There was this interesting dynamic in Orange County at the time, being heavily anti-immigrant but relying on immigrant labor,” said Perea. “It showed me how we’re treated as Mexicans, as undocumented people.” Perea, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, came to the United States at 14, joining his mother who had immigrated a decade earlier. He arrived in Santa Ana, Orange County, just as the Bush administration launched sweeping workplace raids targeting undocumented workers across the nation. At the same time, Los Angeles erupted in historic protests, including “La Gran Marcha,” where more than half a million people marched for immigrant rights. A few years later, Perea would be involved in the Dreamer movement challenging Obama on mass deportations. In 2012, after years of pressure, Obama enacted DACA through executive action. But the more protective pathways to citizenship for millions of undocumented people died in Congress, and have never been revived. “A lot of these fights started to sharpen our politics,” said Perea, now the executive director of the Harbor Institute for Immigrant and Economic Justice. “Are we going to continue to have our immigrant communities be this chess piece for the Democratic Party or Republican special interest? Are we going to constantly be tossed around and gain no meaningful outcome?” For thousands of progressives in Santa Ana, the way forward was clear: Power needed to come from the bottom up. Recognizing a “crisis of democracy” at the local level, Perea and others in the Latino and Vietnamese communities of Santa Ana began campaigning for the right to vote as noncitizens. In November of 2024, these efforts culminated in a measure on the Santa Ana ballot. Measure DD proposed expanding the right to vote to noncitizens in general municipal elections by 2028. The measure, the first of its kind to be proposed in Southern California, failed  by a margin of 59 percent to 41 percent—fewer than 15,000 votes. “This was something people thought was impossible to even get on the ballot,” Perea said. “I think it speaks volumes that there were a large number of people in Santa Ana ready for noncitizen voting on our first try.” Twenty-two localities already allow noncitizen voting of some sort, including San Francisco and Oakland. Each of these municipalities has distinct laws governing noncitizen voting. Many only allow lawful permanent residents to vote, and most limit it to parents in school board elections. Currently, 16 towns in Maryland, two cities in California, three towns in Vermont, and the District of Columbia allow noncitizens a measure of voting rights in local elections. Four municipalities in Massachusetts have also passed local voting laws, but, without approval from the state, they can’t legally implement them. Measure DD was one of the boldest and most inclusive proposals to date, with its definition of “noncitizen” encompassing permanent residents, refugees, undocumented immigrants, DACA recipients, and those on school or work permits. “We established a narrative—now people know what noncitizen voting is,” Perea said. “It’s going to be our job now to make the case of presenting this as the North Star of the [immigrant] movement. It’s going to be a tough battle, but we have nothing to lose.” From the country’s founding until 1926, 40 states at various times allowed noncitizen immigrants to vote in local, state, or federal elections, according to Ron Hayduk, a professor of political science at San Francisco State University. “History flies in the face of this idea that immigrants never could or never should be voting. That it’s improper, that it’s unconstitutional, that it’s illegal. In fact, history shows that it’s the opposite,” said Hayduk. “I like to say that it’s as American as apple pie and older than our national pastime: baseball.” Noncitizen voting, then called “alien suffrage,” was seen as a pathway to foster citizenship and immigrant integration. Millions of immigrants from Western and Northern Europe voted, often advancing anti-slavery and pro-worker causes. But these alien suffrage laws began to change as more immigrants came to the US from Southern and Eastern Europe—Italians, Slovaks, and Jews—who were not seen as white and were often associated with socialist and anarchist ideologies. Between 1840 and 1900, voter turnout in presidential elections was between 70 and 80 percent of the eligible population. However, by 1924, voter turnout had plummeted to 49 percent, coinciding with broader efforts to curtail both voting rights and immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 marked the beginning of these restrictive policies, followed by limits on immigration that reduced annual admissions from as many as 800,000 to 150,000 people. These changes along with other restrictive election reforms—such as state poll taxes, literacy tests, and felon disenfranchisement laws—limited democratic and progressive possibilities for decades. Arkansas was the last state to eliminate alien suffrage in 1926. Immigrant voting was restored in New York City in a limited way during the civil rights era, led by African American and Latino activists as part of a larger movement for community control in school board elections. In the 1980s and ’90s, the sanctuary movements further inspired the restoration of noncitizen voting in Maryland. In 1993, then-State Representative Jamie Raskin wrote a seminal law journal article that put immigrant voting back on the map and helped Takoma Park, Maryland, enact noncitizen voting laws. “He said at the time, ‘Immigrant rights are like the civil rights of the day.’ And by that logic, noncitizen voting is the suffrage movement of our time,” Hayduk said. In early 2020, driven by Santa Ana’s growing immigrant population from Vietnam and Latin America—according to county data, 29.5 percent of the residents are noncitizens—the campaign to restore noncitizen voting in the city found its footing. Inspired by the passage of San Francisco’s Proposition N in 2016—following failed attempts in 2004 and 2010—advocates saw a path forward for Santa Ana. A coalition, called the Santa Ana Families for Fair Elections, spearheaded the campaign for noncitizen voting with support from the ACLU of Southern California. Mayor Valerie Amezcua strongly opposed Measure DD, citing concerns about the expenses of a new voting system and costly litigation similar to what occurred in San Francisco. Additionally, two council members backed by the police union and department association opposed the measure, and one member of the progressive wing concerned about reelection called it too radical a step. “That to me was a clear example of us as advocates deciding to move forward,” Perea said. “What is the point of building a progressive movement if we do not deliver?” The coalition pushed back and seized on the centuries-old American slogan, “No taxation without representation,” framing noncitizen voting as both a democratic and economic issue. Immigrants in Santa Ana contribute more than $117 million in state and local taxes yet have no political say over how those funds are spent. According to city council member Johnathan Hernandez, 70,000 noncitizen residents of voting age—many of whom are business owners and parents—remain excluded from decision-making. “For many it came down to the principle,” Perea said. “I care about the economy. I care about my people. I care about how, locally, my tax dollars are spent.” “Robust and inclusive political participation leads to more diverse representative bodies, making representatives more responsive to all constituents and fostering more effective public policy,” Hayduk said. A report on the impact of immigrant voting in San Francisco showed that noncitizen voting programs can increase broader civic engagement. “These programs encourage greater parental involvement, which in turn, contributed to improved student achievement, reduced drop-out rates, and better school attendance.” Studies on immigrant voting programs in the United States, as well as global studies on noncitizen voting in Sweden, Norway, and Latin America, have found positive outcomes in promoting naturalization and immigrant integration. Over 40 countries on nearly every continent allow for some form of noncitizen voting in local, regional, and even national elections. The opposition against Measure DD raised over $1 million, while the grassroots campaign operated on a much smaller budget of just $10,000. Perea said that this level of expenditure on council races or ballot initiatives was “unprecedented” in Santa Ana. “[It] speaks volumes as to who feels threatened by immigrants and refugees having a seat at the table,” Hernandez said. “Who is it that we’re afraid of? What is going to happen if noncitizens vote? I think Santa Ana becomes a safer and vibrant community. That’s what residents should be afforded.” As Measure DD in Santa Ana failed, voters in eight states—Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin—passed constitutional amendments explicitly banning noncitizen voting. Proponents of these measures, like Republican state Representative Michael Meredith of Kentucky, argued that they were a proactive way to “get ahead of” potential local charter changes that might enfranchise noncitizens in the future and safeguard elections for eligible voters. A surge in election skepticism and anti-immigrant rhetoric accompanied the amendments, in part driven by President-elect Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. Both perpetuated false claims about noncitizens voting in federal elections. In September, Johnson threatened to shut down Congress if the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act—a measure requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections—was not passed. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin “This othering criminalization of immigrants and keeping these myths alive justify draconian immigration restrictions to keep minority rule,” said Hayduk. “It was an attack on the legitimate place of immigrants in our polity, and plays on these ‘Great Replacement’ fears.” Measures like those passed in November provide a pretext to impose voter suppression tactics, according to Hayduk, such as requiring proof of citizenship and strict voter ID laws. A national survey showed that one in 10 adult citizens—around 21.3 million eligible voters—said they would not be able to easily produce their citizenship paperwork in preparation for next-day voting. Other tactics include voter purges and reducing the time frame for mail-in voting. States that misuse DMV records to cross-reference citizenship can flag previous permanent residents who haven’t updated their driver’s licenses to reflect their citizenship status. “The challengers will challenge folks with Latino surnames, Latino in appearance, and those challenges could deter some voters from participating,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Moreover, with Trump promising mass deportations, some fear that their pathway to citizenship may be jeopardized if they participate in local noncitizen voting. Elsewhere in California, the California Local Voting Coalition, a group working to expand voting rights, continues to push for local noncitizen initiatives statewide. Emerging campaigns are underway in Richmond, San Jose, Long Beach, and Pasadena. Across the nation, similar efforts are gaining traction in Maine, Ohio, and Connecticut. Meanwhile, the legal challenge to New York City’s noncitizen voting law is set to reach a final ruling in the coming months. “I think [Trump] is going to radicalize a lot of our community,” Perea said. “Many folks are going to become active. If the extreme right is saying the most outrageous things about immigrants, we are going to have to push for the most radical idea. To present clear divergent views.” Hayduk said the constant scrutiny on whether noncitizens are voting illegally stifles genuine discussions about the merits of local noncitizen voting and humane immigration law. “It’s a missed opportunity for Democrats and progressives more broadly.” Hayduk said. “Debate about immigration and voting rights cuts right to the heart of issues embroiling the nation. Big questions about who is an American and what is the nature of America. Are we a multiracial egalitarian society? Or are we an Anglo-Christian white republic? This is a time to invite the public to think about who ‘we the people’ constitute.” Fatimah Azeem is a 2024 Puffin writing fellow focused on racial justice for The Nation.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The political media calls Trump a “populist.” But as Dr. King made clear in a 1965 speech, American populism was a movement against everything Trump stands for. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the steps of the State Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 25, 1965. The name “Donald Trump” and the word “populism” have become so intertwined you would think the latter was invented by Trump’s MAGA movement itself. In one 24-hour period, just days before the reelected president’s inauguration, the political media published nearly a dozen articles linking Trump to populism. Even a Japanese outlet made the connection in an op-ed last week: “Tune in to American populists,” the headline reads, referring to the group of mostly white “working and middle classes” who sent Trump to office. But the Trump-spawned political rage that the mainstream media likens to “populism” erases the real origins of the idea. This year, on the birthday of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., it’s more important than ever to remember that populism is a political philosophy that’s closer to King’s vision than to MAGA’s. It’s difficult for some people to envision the Southern, Baptist preacher as a fighter for the working class, because his legacy in the American imagination has largely been confined to his organizing against Jim Crow racism. But King wasn’t committed to integration solely to win equal treatment for Black Americans. He recognized the power of multiracial, working-class solidarity to combat the elite, wealthy interests that dominate American society. Nearly 50 years ago, on March 25, 1965, King addressed a crowd from the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery after leading a historic march from Selma. Since referred to as his “How Long? Not Long” speech (or, alternatively, “Our God is Marching On”), it is remembered as one chapter in the well-known struggle for voting rights, having taken place just a few months before President Lyndon Johnson passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But the speech shows the civil rights movement’s fight for voting rights was one part of a larger vision, of upending a social order that was fundamentally exploitative to all workers. “The segregation of the races was really a political stratagem employed by the emerging Bourbon interests in the South to keep the southern masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the land,” King said, referring to the big business–aligned “Bourbon Democrats” of the late 19th century. “Toward the end of the Reconstruction era, something very significant happened. That is what was known as the Populist Movement. The leaders of this movement began awakening the poor white masses and the former Negro slaves to the fact that they were being fleeced by the emerging Bourbon interests. Not only that, but they began uniting the Negro and white masses into a voting bloc that threatened to drive the Bourbon interests from the command posts of political power in the South.” King’s speech deftly encapsulates the divide-and-conquer strategies that have defined the past century of right-wing US politics, before going on to offer prescient remarks about how elites defeated cross-racial solidarity: To meet this threat, the southern aristocracy began immediately to engineer this development of a segregated society. They saturated the thinking of the poor white masses with it, thus clouding their minds to the real issue involved in the Populist Movement. They then directed the placement on the books of the South of laws that made it a crime for Negroes and whites to come together as equals at any level. And that did it. That crippled and eventually destroyed the Populist Movement of the nineteenth century. Well into the 21st century, that strategy is still working. Worse, the people who foment these divisions are now called “populists,” with dominant media narratives cementing this historical amnesia and making the Republican Party nearly synonymous with “the working class.” King’s speech illuminates a brief period of American history when workers organized for their common interests, instead of focusing on arbitrary differences. In this era, populists were just the kind of people Republicans would deride as treacherous communists—and in fact, some of these American populists themselves joined socialist and communist parties in the 1900s. The Populist movement wasn’t perfect, and it wasn’t as racially harmonious as King implies. Some of its white leaders reinforced the segregation of the day and were indifferent to Black American concerns. But both Black and white populists meaningfully organized together to combat harms wrought by the era’s ruling elites: southern planters and merchants, Wall Street bankers, and railroad barons, a history recounted in detail in Omar Ali’s book In the Lion’s Mouth: Black Populism in the New South, 1886-1900. Associating Trump with populism isn’t just historically inaccurate, it’s insulting to the legacy of those who sought real power for the working class. Populists fought for organized labor, not to weaken it and frame it under the euphemism of the “right to work.” Populists wanted a strong social safety net, not to whittle it down to bits. Populists fought for the rights of Black voters, not to disenfranchise them. Their legacy is not to seek a common enemy in other workers—Haitian migrants or trans athletes, “modern women” or Mexican farm workers—but in the elites who amplify these divisions, suppress wages, and make a mockery of working-class concerns. Both the Republican and Democratic Party cater to America’s wealthiest few, but only the GOP has been bestowed with the “populist” crown—regardless of how anti-worker it has become. While King is rightly remembered for his commitment to racial equality, his expansive vision encompassed working-class solidarity with equal conviction. It was King who wrote as far back as 1951 that “capitalism has seen its best days in America” and that it “has failed to meet the needs of the masses.” In the year before his death, King said America needed a “revolution of values” against the “triple evils” of economic exploitation, racism, and militarism. None could be defeated unless they were all defeated. Celebrating King’s legacy means remembering what he stood for. He, like those who struggled before him, showed America what a true populist movement looks like. It doesn’t look anything like Donald Trump.

As newly released classified documents confirm activists’ long-held suspicions, the disclosures should also alert us to current dangers. Recently released CIA documents revealing that the Agency surveilled Puerto Rican and Mexican American activists confirm what many of us have known for decades: that US government agencies have spied on Latinos—and probably still do. The cache of 55 civil rights era documents declassified by CIA Director William J. Burns in response to requests from Representatives Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) raise questions about how and why the foreign intelligence–focused CIA spied on over 7,000 US citizens and over 100 domestic organizations—and did so in direct violation of its 1947 charter. The illegal program, baptized with the James Bond movie–sounding (or Bond spoof–sounding) name “Operation Chaos,” directed CIA assets to infiltrate and surveil Chicano, Puerto Rican, and other Latino community organizations and activists. The purpose of the operation was to “record the organizing, groups, and individuals with whom they came into contact,” according to a declassified memo titled “CIA Contact with Dissident, Radical and/or Leftist Elements in the United States.” Following the riots and racial unrest that shook the country in 1967, President Lyndon Johnson directed federal agencies to investigate the causes of the social explosion. His directive led to the analysis and recommendations of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (known as the Kerner Commission after its chair, Illinois Governor Otto Kerner Jr.). Among the commission’s lesser-known recommendations was a call for the government to integrate its surveillance systems. In response, then–CIA Director Richard Helms ordered the agency to start collecting information on what one FBI memo described as “racial agitators who might travel abroad,” persons who were also investigated for “having any significant bearing on possible racial disturbances in the U.S.” In launching Operation Chaos, Johnson created the cultural hack used to legitimate the CIA’s illegal activities targeting US citizens in both the analog and digital eras of surveillance: stigmatizing Latino, Black and other racialized groups as threats to national security and then surveilling, harassing, and even killing them, as happened in the better-known case of US surveillance of the Black Panthers. Johnson’s successor, Richard Nixon, expanded the program in response to what he called the “wild orgasm of anarchists sweeping across the country like a prairie fire.” As a result, Operation Chaos infiltrated and surveilled groups like the Brown Berets, La Raza Unida Party, the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, and others opposed to the war in Vietnam. Representative Castro, who sits on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Foreign Affairs Committees, requested release of the documents, in part, to right past wrongs against these and other Latino groups, many of whom suffered harassment, losses of funding, and ruined reputations. “Organizations operating lawfully and in the spirit of democracy were surveilled and often discredited, ” said Castro in a statement to The Nation. “Today, greater transparency about those activities can help us correct the record and clear the names of those who were unfairly targeted,” he added. The broad Latino net cast by Operation Chaos extended far beyond the more radical Latino groups. Also swept up in the program were local religious, nonprofit, education, media, and other groups organizing around housing, education, and other local and domestic concerns. United Bronx Parents and the Chelsea Coalition on Housing were targeted, as were Latinos and non-Latinos in the SEIU, the American Federation of Teachers, and other labor unions. Among the many Latino leaders profiled and targeted by the CIA’s unwarranted domestic operations were “Corky” Gonzalez, one of the leaders of the Crusade for Justice in Denver, legendary LA-based educator Sal Castro, and members of the Young Lords and Puerto Rican Revolutionary Workers Organization, among others. The declassified documents include memos documenting CIA surveillance of far-more-conservative figures like legendary labor leader Cesar Chavez, a devout Catholic and former Navy veteran who often referred to undocumented immigrants as “illegals” and “wetbacks.” Unlike members of the Brown Berets, the Young Lords, La Raza Unida Party, or the Black Panthers, Chavez had no deep commitment to international solidarity and other causes favored by the New Left or the anti-war, Chicano, or other radical movements. In one declassified memo, CIA assets inform their supervisors, “A sensitive source has reported that Cesar CHAVEZ has declined the invitation from the General Union of Mexican Workers and Peasants (UGOCM) to attend their meeting to be held in November 1971.” For Representative Castro and others, revelations contained in the documents dating back to the tape recorders and other analog devices used illegally the civil rights era have implications for Latino and other organizations facing the likelihood of digital surveillance in the current age of intersectional empire. “Every few years,” said Castro, “Congress considers legislation to reform or revise the authorities held by US intelligence agencies. A more complete historical record will also help Congress better understand the guardrails needed to protect civil liberties and prevent future overreach.” Another major focus of the declassified documents are the students who are often the heart of major social movements. For example, one 1969 cable refers to the destruction of “incriminating documents” implicating “wofirm” (code referring to the CIA) assets operating on the University of Arizona campus. The cable also refers to an apparent “contract” between the Agency and the University of Arizona, whose administration shared the CIA’s concerns about the militant anti-racist student group the Brown Berets and others organizing for a “Latin Studies Department”—one of the precursors to current ethnic studies programs being dismantled in the anti-DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) frenzy. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin Reading about how the cables justify surveillance and other harassment by conflating peaceful protest with violent extremism, I can’t help but wonder about recent revelations of surveillance arrangements between university administrators and different federal agencies concerned about hot-button issues like DEI and Palestine today. Hundreds of documents obtained by Bloomberg last May show how, for example, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal government agencies continued the practice of making false equivalencies (i.e., “The concern is that Yale University is pro Hamas,”) as they surveilled students during anti-genocide protests at Columbia, UCLA, and other universities. Like a wormhole connecting analog and digital age eras of state surveillance, reports that student groups, including the Brown Berets and other Latino student groups, are still being surveilled and harassed by local and federal law enforcement for organizing against genocide in Palestine provide fresh grounds for concern. The released documents will also raise some very personal concerns among many—including me. Over the years, I have had my own encounters with the surveillance state. In the late 1980s, Central American organizations I belonged to or was affiliated with were surveilled and infiltrated by agents of the FBI’s COINTELPRO program, as documented in the Congressional Record, news reports, and books. I read the reports on activists doing solidarity work and remember government memos about us. The memos described surveillance activities similar to those undertaken during Operation Chaos and how the information gathered would be “sent to the appropriate authorities of the government of El Salvador.” Back then, more than a few deported Salvadoran activists were murdered by the death squads of the US-backed government. The recent revelations about Operation Chaos make me wonder what the CIA and other agencies have been up to more recently. A lot has happened in the 50 years since the illegal activities described took place—50 years after the Altair 8800 (the first PC) started us on the way to freely giving up our contacts through the social media platforms that state surveillance depends on. AI machines are already learning from our history. The question is: Will we?

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Progressive philanthropy lacks good strategy, so too many of our organizations are hollow—and that left us unable to prevent a second Trump term. In the wake of Trump’s reelection, many of us on the progressive left are reevaluating our work. We’re taking a hard look at the campaigns and movements we’ve given our lives to and asking ourselves, where did we go wrong? I’ve especially seen this humility from the leaders who have delivered some of the few wins we’ve had over the last decade—the formation of new unions, federal climate investments, student debt forgiveness, and the expansion of social safety nets in blue states. This is because—unlike, apparently, many Democratic consultants and campaign advisers—we know we’re in much bigger trouble than just a messaging misstep or a weak presidential candidate. In the last few decades, globalization and a shift in economic investment from manufacturing to knowledge sectors resulted in job loss and stagnant wages for most workers. Meanwhile, neoliberal policy destroyed the state-based social safety net those same workers once relied on. For the vast majority of people in this country, the bottom fell out. The purchasing power of the average hourly wage last peaked in 1978 (after adjusting for inflation). Since just last year, American homelessness has increased by 18 percent. Kamala Harris’s campaign offered some proposals aimed at the working class, but failed to make economic insecurity (and people’s anger at the establishment) the number-one priority in its communications. An analysis performed by Jacobin of Harris’s speeches, rallies, press gaggles, and interview scripts found that the campaign “pivoted away from the economy starting around mid-September…moving away from an adversarial stance toward elites.” Unsurprisingly, on Election Day we saw working-class voters continue to move to the Republican Party. According to NBC News exit polls, non-college-educated voters were evenly split between the Republican and Democratic candidate “as recently as 2012,” as Alex Seitz-Wald observed for NBC, but in this cycle, “they broke 2-to-1 for Trump over Harris.” Rather than grappling seriously with how Democrats should respond to this macroeconomic crisis in the electorate, many pundits have blamed progressive nonprofit advocacy groups for pushing the Democratic Party too far to the left on identity politics, as Matthew Yglesias did in his postelection analysis. Yglesias is wrong, though, about “the groups” being the decision-makers on this. More often than not, Democratic operatives themselves, in their attempt to hold a heterogenous voter coalition together, were appealing to identity politics or non-economic issues—seemingly so that they could avoid giving into populist economic demands and keep their big donors happy. However, Yglesias did get something right: “The groups” he refers to do have a “demonstrated inability to actually drive votes or deliver constituencies.” And that is what progressive leaders must now reckon with. Many of our “groups” do not represent the multiracial working class, and besides labor, it’s not clear who on the left still does. Both political scientist Theda Skocpol and the late labor leader Jane McAlevey have documented the erosion of organized bases that are truly active. National organizations may claim memberships of hundreds of thousands or millions, but in reality include online petition signatures in that count. Local grassroots organizations may claim to represent the working people of a city or county, but struggle to turn out more than 30 people to an action. A “member” once was someone who attended weekly political education sessions and regularly canvassed their entire apartment building; now what counts as “membership” is hollow. In that sense, the progressive left is to blame for Trump’s reelection, because, no matter how hard the center or right make the conditions, it is still up to the left to organize and build the power of the working class and prevent the rise of fascism. Both the labor movement of the 1930s and the civil rights movement of the 1960s succeeded in building militant mass bases. How did we get to a 21st-century left that is basically divorced from that project? Several historical factors explain why, but a big one is the evolution of funding. Union dues resourced the industrial labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s, while a mix of Black churches, dues, and modestly sized but radical foundations funded the civil rights movement. Today, the majority of progressive nonprofits rely on institutional philanthropy (foundations and large-dollar donors) for their budgets. Whether we like it or not, funding is the primary incentive structure that makes and remakes the current American left ecosystem today, what determines which work gets funded (or defunded), how, where, to what scale, on what timeline. If the money backing that work is unstrategic, the work itself will also be unstrategic. The corrosive impact is much broader than the obvious case, e.g., when an organization ends a strategic program because a funder stops backing it. I’ve seen organizations prop up out-of-touch, losing issues or bills for years because they’re funded to do so; duplicative coalitions that fight with each other for the same reason; organizations forced to, for the worse, reshape 501c4 (electioneering) work into 501c3 (non-election-related) work; organizations unable to take on ambitious or experimental projects because they’re too overwhelmed working on existing but ineffective funded projects; and zombie “base-building” organizations that should have sunsetted decades ago continue to lumber along without purpose. For each of these problems, there is a funder directive behind it: The funder is narrowly invested in a siloed issue or bill; the funder wants to donate c3 money and not c4 money for tax reasons; the funder can’t tell which organization or coalition is best positioned to take on a project, so it funds competing or even contradictory efforts; the “zombie” organization’s founder is a funder darling even though everyone on the ground knows that the organization doesn’t do what it says it does anymore. Back when I was an issue campaigner, we often suffered from the fact that many of our organizations’ executive directors had “funder brain,” a phenomenon where an ED spends so much time packaging and spinning their work to funders that they could no longer be the disciplined, strategic leaders we needed them to be. The right’s own nonprofit ecosystem is also backed by big donors—and groups such as the Federalist Society and Americans for Prosperity are successful despite being largely philanthropy-funded. But the left has a fundamentally different and harder problem than the right. First, the material interests of the right’s donors are aligned with their agenda. Second, the right has a culture of ruthlessness, a total non-ambivalence about doing whatever it takes to win power, that the left lacks. Third, and most importantly, the right-wing project is to further entrench power and wealth in the hands of the few rather than the many. The right can win by using a primarily top-down approach, funding political, ideological, and media projects that capture institutions and shape people’s worldviews. The left must not only do that, but also build mass movements that strengthen people’s capacity to act together so they can take power back from the few. We are running uphill rather than downhill. Since we are the underdog, strategy is particularly important, because strategy allows us to discover the stronger opponent’s few weak points and apply our strengths to their weaknesses. This is a concept known as “strategic leverage.” Good strategy is not a vision or an inspiring speech, a list of all the activities we wish we could do, and not a template we fill out. Good strategy primarily relies on an accurate diagnosis of a problem that can simplify a complex landscape down into a few factors that can be leveraged. And when the left does this, we know we can win. The electoral left used good strategy when they ran candidates of color against white incumbents in majority-minority districts (such as when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pulled off an upset victory in 2018). Organizations such as IfNotNow used good strategy when they mobilized Jewish communities to public action after October 7, relying on the growing generational divide within Jewish communities on the issue of Israel-Palestine. New labor formations such as Starbucks Workers United used good strategy when they took issue stances that matched their workers’ and consumers’ sentiments better than Starbucks did. Unfortunately, complex structural change is hard. There are many myths about how change actually happens, including the liberal belief, the “monolithic myth,” that great men in history (politicians and business leaders) have sole decision-making authority and change happens only by pressuring them into or out of policies. But the left also has its own myths. Too many of us believe in “magic bullet” theories of change, in which a specific narrow tactic—just worker co-ops or just progressive primaries, for instance—will save us. In reality, change is a process of successfully building an entire ecosystem, not just one thing, to compete with and replace the entire existing ecosystem. In this approach, we would not only win elections but also resource our elected officials with the communications and political infrastructure they need to pass bills; we would not only expand the state-based social safety net but also invest in economic alternatives such as community banks and land trusts; we would not only build new unions but also rebuild third spaces where people can form meaningful relationships with each other that we can then organize. How to fund and build this ecosystem strategically is the question. Normally, the warring camps of philanthropy are quite entrenched in defending their practices. In this moment when the organizing side of the progressive movement is open to honesty and self-reflection, I wonder if those of us on the funder side—myself included—could be more open to reevaluating existing philanthropic approaches as well. We must grapple with the reality that the current models we have for philanthropy are not up to the task of incubating, developing and supporting strategy on the left. There are a few prominent models within left-wing philanthropy. Effective Altruism uses utilitarian calculations that seek to maximize the efficiency of capital in returning greater quality of life. What it claims to be its strength—being ideology-neutral—is actually its weakness, because it fails to recognize the fundamentally political nature of problems and thus overly focuses on addressing symptoms, rather than causes, of power imbalance. While EA often funds left causes, many EA philanthropists have also supported right-wing politicians, thinking they were making savvy deals. In doing so they were actually propping up on the front end the exact system whose symptoms they were trying to remedy on the backend. This is an example of how EA was never designed to produce good strategy: There is no strategic leverage in Band-Aid solutions. In another dominant model, Strategic Philanthropy, funders set goals, create plans, and measure outcomes with metrics and benchmarks. In theory, this sounds good—funders are trying to apply a consistent logic to their giving and evaluate its success. However, in practice, the power dynamic between funders and grantees means grantees have a structural incentive to obfuscate the nature and results of their work. Frank sharing of information is critical to good strategy. A second danger lies in mistaking a process for strategy, as one of the founders of this giving framework, Hal Harvey, later admitted. Harvey laments philanthropists who “conjure best practices, metrics, milestones, key performance indicators, reporting requirements, and more. Each item may make sense on its own, but in total it’s nonsense. And in any event, doing all of this is still no substitute for a real strategy.” Finally, Trust-Based Philanthropy, which attempts to bring funders and grantees into deeper relationships through long-term grants, fewer grant restrictions, and fewer reporting burdens, is a vast improvement on some of the failings of previous models. However, especially in its most rudimentary forms, TBP still does not produce the conditions necessary for good strategy. TBP often makes funders feel good by having people of color, current/former movement leaders and various people with impacted identities serve as advisers, senior staff, board members, and decision-makers. We agree that people don’t have good strategy just because of an elite education or fancy job; similarly, people don’t have good strategy just because of an identity or past nonprofit job. The hyperfocus on representation of identities in TBP serves as a release valve for white guilt but does not automatically translate to work that actually changes power relations or material conditions for people. In Elite Capture, academic Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò explains three challenges with this “politics of deference,” as often practiced in TBP. First, deference can be a form of abdication of responsibility. Second, deferring continuously, rather than struggling through principled disagreement, is actually antithetical to the kind of coalition-building politics we need to win. And finally, and most importantly, it misidentifies the problem as who gets to speak inside a room when the problem is what’s happening to the vast majority of people outside that room. Our ultimate duty is to build multiracial working-class power so we can win a world where philanthropy is no longer needed, not to make the institution of philanthropy somewhat more equitable. TBP helps us do the latter, but unfortunately, doing the latter in no way guarantees the former. All three camps struggle with the same basic problem: good strategy is really hard. Swapping algorithms (EA), metrics and best practices (Strategic Philanthropy), and one set of people for another in decision-making roles (TBP)—none of these things sufficiently create the conditions for a strategic left. Nor is it as simple as deriding the nonprofit industrial complex and renouncing philanthropy as a source of funding altogether. We need money to win. Some of that can and should come from alternative revenue models, such as membership dues or selling a popular product at scale, as activist and entrepreneur Peter Murray described. But philanthropy isn’t going anywhere, and the left shouldn’t leave power on the table by rejecting it altogether. Trump’s reelection should be a wake-up call. My challenge to my fellow funders is this: You, more than anyone else, shape the left ecosystem that is supposed to be strong enough to win over the right. All of us who have the power to move or influence the moving of money must reexamine our assumptions. So if what we’re doing isn’t working, what would? For my part, I am particularly interested in exploring how to build what long-time activist Marshall Ganz describes as “strategic capacity” across the entire funding process, between and within the money side and the organizational side. In his 2009 book Why David Sometimes Wins, Ganz defines strategic capacity as “the ability to devise good strategy,” which allows an organization to “take advantage of moments of unique opportunity.” He identified three conditions necessary to building strategic capacity: stronger motivation than that of the opposition, “better access to salient knowledge,” and “deliberations [that are] venues for learning.” The first condition is particularly challenging because our donors’ interests are not materially aligned with redistributive politics, but I believe and have seen that it’s possible to elicit a motivation among donors that overpowers even that of material interest. All people, even extremely wealthy people, want to live meaningful and purposeful lives, and that is a greater self-interest than even wealth accumulation. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin I’m also interested in figuring out how to enable the second and third conditions Ganz identified for strategic capacity—proximity to the most important information and spaces for honest learning—in the donor community I’m building. To experiment with these two conditions, we are developing a feedback loop for validated learning, a process by which we can glean the most quality and accurate learning from each grant about how society-wide change actually happens, and how money relates to that change. We are still early days, but in the grant debriefs we’ve done with organizations, leaders have acknowledged they’ve been more forthright and reflective in our conversations not only compared to conversations with other funders but even compared to conversations inside their coalitions. A sign we’re actually getting to the heart of how structural change happens, and how money relates to that process of change, is that our internal takeaways often run counter to the publicly shared narrative of how and why the left won or lost something. We’ll see if we can continue to scale this work and our learning. It will require practicing a culture of inquiry, honesty, curiosity, and experimentation both with partner organizations and within donor communities. It will require transforming ourselves to be emotionally resilient so we pivot (not retreat) when our funding experiments fail. It will require developing our strategic analysis so that we are actually able to make good assessments, digest each learning cycle and integrate new, challenging knowledge into our larger theory of change. We start from the position that in the wake of neoliberalism and fascism, we don’t exactly know how to win a world where everyone is fed, sheltered, and cared for. But we’d like to try to figure it out. The left needs a model of philanthropy motivated fundamentally by rigorous learning. Only then will we develop a set of funders and partner movements with the capacity to do good strategy. And as the underdogs, only then will we win.

        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Whether or not we agree with the Biden administration’s arguments, progressives shouldn’t root for the court to rule in favor of Tik Tok. On Thursday [January 10], the Supreme Court is holding a special, extended, two-hour oral argument on an emergency petition. The question before them is whether the looming forced divestiture of TikTok in the United States is constitutional. But this case is about far more than whether the United States should allow a Chinese-controlled TikTok to operate in the US. It’s about corporate speech rights, and the nature of national sovereignty. Even if you don’t agree with Biden’s argument about TikTok, you shouldn’t be rooting for the court to strike down the law. You should be rooting for this court—which can get a little trigger happy with corporate speech rights—to say nothing at all. That’s because there’s a real possibility that the court could reject TikTok’s specific plea but nonetheless give Big Tech companies a road map for insulating themselves from regulation by describing social media rights in sweeping First Amendment terms. The emergency petition was brought by TikTok, asking the court to temporarily block enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Signed into law last April, PAFACA uses an existing framework that identifies China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as “foreign adversaries” and bans the use in the US of apps controlled by any such country. Without court intervention, the Chinese government-controlled ByteDance will be required to sell TikTok by January 19. TikTok’s constitutional argument is grounded in corporate speech rights cases. They and their supporters argue that (a) TikTok has its own First Amendment rights, (b) Americans use TikTok to share information and express themselves, and (c) since the law restricting who can own it might lead to the Chinese government withdrawing it from those Americans altogether, the law violates the First Amendment rights of American users. Unsurprisingly, it cites Citizens United in support of all of these claims. Before the 1970s, such an argument would have been plainly invalid. Restrictions targeting foreign government involvement in domestic politics are taken for granted as a feature of sovereignty across the globe. While TikTok emphasizes that it is a communications platform to bolster its arguments, sovereign limits on foreign ownership have been particularly concentrated in communications industries. Argentina, Canada, the United States, and many other countries have limits on foreign ownership of television and radio networks. TikTok is prohibited on official devices in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Austria, and wholly banned because of Chinese ownership in India. In November, the Canadian government required TikTok to dissolve its Canadian business. The founding fathers embedded restrictions on foreign governmental interference in our constitutional structure. At the Constitutional Convention, Alexander Hamilton cautioned that “foreign powers also will not be idle spectators. They will interpose, the confusion will increase.” The Foreign Emoluments Clause, which we know too well—if only because of Trump’s repeated violations of it—bars federal officeholders from accepting payments from foreign governments. The high bar for treaty ratification grew out of James Madison’s fear of “the power of foreign nations” to interfere in treaty negotiations. American statutes have consistently applied foreign ownership restrictions to the communications sector. Driven by fears that foreign adversaries might use radio to influence policy, Congress passed the Federal Radio Act, which authorized the precursor to the FCC to license radio companies, and added a 20 percent limit on foreign stockholding to the restrictions from the 1912 Act. The Communications Act of 1934 includes a section prohibiting a foreign government or its representative from holding any radio license. The constitutionality of these rules was taken for granted. A series of cases in the 1970s that had nothing to do with foreign ownership—but everything to do with a novel understanding of the First Amendment—set the stage for the questions the court is facing this week. Two big 1970s cases, Virginia State Pharmacy Board and Bellotti, reframed the First Amendment as not solely the right to speak but also a right to hear—including corporate speech. The first case, brought by Ralph Nader and Public Citizen, established that corporations cannot be limited in pharmaceutical advertising because consumers have a right to hear ads. The second, in an opinion by Justice Powell—with a fierce dissent by that well-known radical William Rehnquist—concluded that members of the public had the right to hear political persuasion by banking corporations, and so states couldn’t ban corporate speech around referendums. It was a neat trick, one that sounded reasonable, but in practice led to the explosion of corporations using the First Amendment to strike down any laws that limited their reach. The most famous of these cases was Citizens United v. FEC, which relied on Bellotti to conclude that individuals had a right to hear corporate ads about candidates for office. One question that haunted all these cases was the one now at issue in the TikTok case: If corporate speech rights are grounded in a right of Americans to hear, wouldn’t foreign governments gain the same kind of protection-by-reflection? How can there be a “right to hear” ExxonMobil ads without a “right to hear” Russian ads? Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin My own view is that the entire “right to hear” enterprise was a misinterpretation of the First Amendment, and that while courts should strike down viewpoint-based restrictions, they should allow states and the federal government to impose content-neutral corporate speech rules. But I don’t think a hasty New Year’s oral argument is the time to work through all these questions. The other big potential issue here is how the court characterizes the “speech rights” of social media platforms themselves. In a series of cases, including Netchoice v. Moody, the court has repeatedly punted on questions of how to think about algorithmic feeds. The ACLU, which has been leading the charge on expanding corporate speech rights since Buckley v. Valeo, filed a brief seeking an expansive vision. But that could mean states wouldn’t be able to limit social media’s targetting of teenagers, or regulate potentially dangerous algorithms (like those that deluge anorexic teenagers with weight loss videos). The politics of the case are all over the place; Donald Trump attempted to require a TikTok sale in his first administration, but changed his mind after billionaire TikTok investor Jeffrey Yass became one of his biggest donors. Biden supports the law, as do most Democratic lawmakers, but public support has bounced around, and it is now mostly unpopular. Even if the Supreme Court upholds the law, Trump has several ways in which he could effectively reverse the divestiture requirement—after he becomes president. I’ve read several of the amicus briefs filed in this case, and found them a little scatterbrained. SCOTUS gave interested parties less than two weeks over a holiday break to file, so there’s a degree of sloppiness by the amici that is unusual for Supreme Court arguments. I’d include the brief I filed in this category—while I stand by the arguments, cites were only checked once, and the structure was thrown together. So why file at all? For me, the urgent need to file flowed from the long echo of Buckley v. Valeo, the first case in which the Supreme Court discovered that money is speech. That was another hastily decided case, where the justices put speed over thoughtfulness so that they could rule before the 1976 elections. They ended up splitting the baby: upholding contribution limits while striking down spending limits, and turning four generations of politicians into professional fundraisers instead of representatives.

        "title": "In the GOP Civil War Over Immigration, Both Sides Are Racists | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy want cheap labor—not a multiracial democracy. Democrats are rightly excited by the fact that the MAGA crew have already started viciously fighting among themselves even before Donald Trump’s inauguration. After all, with the Republicans set to enjoy a trifecta (even one that rests on a fragile hold of the House of Representatives), the best hope for Democrats is that internal GOP strife will sabotage Trump’s ability to enact his agenda. This is, in fact, what happened in Trump’s previous go-round as president, when the MAGA king was often thwarted by internal strife in his coalition (particularly the intense battles between GOP institutionalists such as Mitch McConnell and anti-system provocateurs such as Steve Bannon). The current intramural GOP strife is a familiar battle between a business elite that wants cheap immigrant labor and nativist agitators who believe restriction of immigration is central to the MAGA agenda. As New York magazine reports, “Last week, while Americans were busy celebrating the holidays with their families, a contentious online rift emerged among the MAGA faithful after Donald Trump’s tech-world allies, led by billionaire Elon Musk, began pushing back on attacks on highly skilled foreign tech workers by the movement’s nativist wing.” The initial instigation for the conflict was Trump’s nomination of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born tech entrepreneur, as senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence. The battle soon spread to the larger issue of H-1B visas, which are widely used in Silicon Valley as a way of hiring immigrants. Leading the charge against both Krishnan and the H-1B program was Laura Loomer, a controversial media personality who reportedly has special access to Trump. As New York noted, “Loomer, who has never been one to shy away from outright racism, also launched attacks on Indian immigrants, calling them ‘third world invaders’ while celebrating the ‘white Europeans’ who she claimed built the country.” In battling Loomer, Musk and his allies presented themselves as opponents of racism. Musk tweeted that “those contemptible fools must be removed from the Republican Party, root and stem” and added that by “contemptible fools” he meant “those in the Republican Party who are hateful, unrepentant racists.” While it is true that Loomer and her allies (including former Trump adviser Steven Bannon and pundit Ann Coulter) are racists, that does not mean that Musk and his fellow Silicon Valley allies (notably former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is working with Musk in advising Trump on subduing the federal government to the MAGA agenda) are animated by truly anti-racist politics in their struggle. As my Nation colleague Joan Walsh noted, as repugnant as they are, anti-system agitators such as Loomer and Bannon have a point when they deride the H-1B program as exploitative. For decades, progressive pro-labor activists have argued that the H-1B is in effect a guest worker program, creating a reserve army of employees who work for lower wages and have fewer rights than American citizens or those with permanent residency status. The H-1B visa is tied to employment, which means employees are especially vulnerable to exploitation. On January 2, Bernie Sanders expressed this long-standing leftist position, noting, “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” The current GOP civil war is one where both sides have profoundly reactionary and bigoted views of society, although with slight variations. MAGA nativists such as Loomer and Bannon are dreaming of a return to the overwhelmingly white America of the 1950s, with middle-class jobs a patrimony reserved largely for the nation’s dominant ethnic group. Musk and Ramaswamy might want a more multiracial America, but it would still be a profoundly hierarchical one, with immigrants providing the cheap labor that allows the 1 percent to flourish. Musk’s own history of racism clarifies the fact that both factions in this battle are just offering different strands of bigotry. Musk has a long history of promoting racist myths such as the idea of “white genocide” and the “Great Replacement.” These ideas are, as Julia Black documented in a 2022 article for Business Insider, tied up with his eugenicist belief that people such as himself have superior genes and thus a duty to populate the earth. This is a belief that Musk seems to have acquired from his father, Errol Musk. As Black reports: Musk, who has fathered 10 known children with three women, is the tech world’s highest-profile pronatalist, albeit unofficially. He has been open about his obsession with Genghis Khan, the 13th-century Mongol ruler whose DNA can still be traced to a significant portion of the human population. One person who has worked directly with Musk and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for this article recalled Musk expressing his interest as early as 2005 in “populating the world with his offspring. In August, Elon’s father…told me that he was worried about low birth rates in what he called ‘productive nations.’” Musk’s ally Ramaswamy has cagily recast these arguments in a more politically correct form, as a matter of culture rather than genetics. According to Ramaswamy, Silicon Valley needs to hire immigrants because “American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” One reason not to take Ramaswamy’s claim to care about culture seriously is that he himself, like Musk, has a history of racism. Moreover, these “cultural” justifications for hierarchy are often just barely disguised manifestations of the belief that some people are inherently masters and others inherently servants. The Indian journalist Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, in taking sides with Musk against a nativist critic of the H-1B program, gave the game away by arguing, “Three generations of my ancestors have spoken & written, better English than your blue collar labourer family. I’ll hire you to polish my shoes though, because that’s the only thing you seem to be qualified for.” Iyer-Mitra’s words show that support of Silicon Valley’s version of meritocracy is perfectly compatible with aristocratic hauteur. Musk’s belief in the greatness of his own genes and the necessary to populate the planet with his DNA is a particularly ludicrous manifestation of the same attitude. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin At the very same time that Musk was decrying the racism of Loomer and other critics of the H-1B visa, he was expressing suport for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which is notoriously anti-immigrant. There’s no tension between Musk’s two positions. He is opportunistically anti-racist when he needs workers for his company, but in the long run he wants to keep the multiracial working class disciplined and divided. The best way to do that is to support nativist political movements, whether MAGA in the United States or AfD in Germany. For progressives, there’s little reason to choose sides between Musk’s cynical racism and the racism of MAGA anti-system agitators like Loomer and Bannon. At best, we can hope that the internal strife will weaken both these noxious forces. The true path forward involves using the political space opened up by right-wing infighting to make a more principled argument for immigration—one based on the goal of creating a multiracial working class with a shared value of cosmopolitan solidarity that can overthrow the plutocrats and their racist coalition.

        "title": "President Biden Should Pardon Ethel Rosenberg | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access A newly released classified document shows that the National Security Agency knew Ethel Rosenberg was not a spy—and that the government executed her anyway. Seventy-five years ago, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. During their trial the following year in 1951, presiding judge Irving Kauffman termed their actions in passing secrets to the Soviet Union “worse than murder.” Despite a worldwide campaign for clemency, the Rosenbergs were executed in Sing Sing prison in 1953. American society was deeply fractured between detractors who believed that their treason constituted—in the words of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover—the “crime of the century,” and supporters convinced that they were innocent victims of Cold War hysteria. Since 1953, the Rosenberg case continued to haunt a generation of Americans, and passionate arguments over their guilt or innocence persisted. The “Venona” cables, declassified and released in 1995, highlighted Julius’s role. The Venona project intercepted and translated top-secret coded messages between Moscow and its overseas KGB stations. The cables revealed that Julius led a spy ring in New York in the 1940s. But there is now a new and important piece of evidence: a previously classified document released in August 2024 by the National Security Agency (NSA). Dated August 22, 1950, it is a memorandum from the senior codebreaker on the Venona project, Meredith Gardner, who concluded that Ethel was not a spy. Historians and commentators have remained polarized over Ethel’s culpability. For Emory University historian Harvey Klehr, whose 2021 essay “The Eternal Return of Ethel Rosenberg” asks, “How has the myth of her innocence become so untethered from the evidence of her guilt?,” the case is closed: Ethel was rightly convicted—even if wrongly executed—and her defenders refuse to face the facts. Klehr agreed with the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research director, Jonathan Brent, who argued that “the myth [of Ethel’s innocence] is not dependent on evidence, the myth is a matter of belief, which transcends evidence.… evidence doesn’t matter to those people who are true believers.” But evidence does matter to me. And the evidence points to Ethel’s innocence. There are only two deciphered mentions of Ethel in the Venona cables. The first is a September 21, 1944, cable from the New York KGB station stating that “Liberal [Rosenberg] and his wife recommended her [Ruth Greenglass, Ethel’s sister-in-law] as an intelligent and clever girl,” whose apartment could be used as a safe house. The second is a November 27, 1944, cable profiling Ethel—significantly, she was identified by name and never assigned a codename, although codenames were customary for both sources and agents—that stated: “Knows about her husband’s work” (where “work” clearly implied espionage) but added, “In view of her delicate health does not work.” This was shared with the FBI in 1948. Ethel, in short, was certainly aware of Julius’s activities and possibly shared a recommendation, but the Venona cables confirm that, at most, she was peripheral to his spy ring. The significance of Gardner’s 1950 memorandum is that it further exculpates Ethel from active engagement in undercover activity. With most of the Venona decryptions completed in 1948–49, the memorandum assessed what the decrypts meant. Given Gardner’s pivotal role in the project, his opinion was authoritative. His memo reviewed findings about the Rosenberg network under the heading “Atomic Espionage Spy Ring.” In Section 5, he validated the veracity of the November 1944 cable. He noted that “Mrs Rosenberg was a party member, a devoted wife, and that she knew about her husband’s work, but that due to ill health she did not engage in the work herself.” It is clear what Gardner meant here by “the work”: involvement in Julius’s espionage. Gardner wrote his memorandum 11 days after Ethel was arrested. Because he liaised closely with the FBI, and because of the significance of the case, it seems almost certain that J. Edgar Hoover would have been apprised of it and, arguably, influenced Hoover’s April 1951 recommendation against Ethel’s death sentence. The evidence, even for conspiracy to commit espionage, as charged, was too flimsy. That the FBI knew this is supported by an internal FBI memo dated July 17, 1950, the day of Julius’s arrest. It reported that the Bureau had been advised by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division that “there was insufficient evidence to issue process against [Ethel] at this time.” Instead, as is now well-known, she was to be used as a “lever” (Hoover’s word) on her husband to force a confession and to implicate accomplices. But she refused to buckle (“She called our bluff,” the deputy attorney-general, William Rogers told New York Times reporter Sam Roberts, author of a book about Ethel’s brother David Greenglass) and her silence sealed her fate. If her brother had not cut a deal and lied in court so his wife could escape prosecution, Ethel would have been spared the death sentence. But once sentenced, she had only a Hobson’s choice: disavow Julius or accept death. In refusing clemency, President Eisenhower believed “she has obviously been the leader in everything they did in the spy ring.” He was wrong. Weinstein and Vassiliev conclude that “at most she played only a minor, supporting role,” which—had it not been for the heated legal and political atmosphere—would have led to a short jail term and “perhaps not even to her arrest.” Moreover, as the NSA and the FBI had concluded, awareness and knowledge was not tantamount to active complicity or conspiracy. Definitive proof was absent. It is not my intention here to revisit the well-trodden ground of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct or the perjured testimony of the Greenglasses during Ethel’s trial. Suffice to say that a forensic analysis by five legal scholars of her indictment and conviction concluded that, from the outset, the FBI knew its case against her was threadbare, “too weak to justify arresting her, much less prosecuting her,” but pressured David and Ruth Greenglass into “remembering”—we now know falsely—Ethel typing notes for Julius. Their testimony was crucial to Ethel’s conviction. David’s public admission to Roberts in 2001 and the unsealing of Ruth’s grand jury testimony in 2008 confirmed the former’s perjury and the latter’s contradictions. A flagrant miscarriage of justice had occurred. Why, then, do some historians argue that Ethel’s innocence is a myth “untethered” from conclusive evidence of her guilt? Their arguments hinge primarily on two sets of sources: the fragmentary Venona decrypts, and the transcribed notebooks smuggled out of Moscow by the former KGB operative and journalist Alexander Vassiliev. Supporters of the position that Ethel was a functioning spy rely heavily on the September 21, 1944, cable (cited above). Those three words, “and his wife,” are central to their argument that Ethel was engaged in a conspiracy. However, the cable, in an earlier sentence, had Julius alone recommending Ruth, “with a safe flat in view.” Vassiliev transcribed this same cable as “‘Liberal’ has recommended Ruth Greenglass” with no mention of “his wife.” A November 14, 1944, cable directly implicated Ruth—she “agreed to cooperate with us in drawing in [David]”—but, again, it contains no reference to Ethel. The second Venona cable in which Ethel is mentioned (New York to Moscow, November 27,1944) was a response from the New York station to Moscow Center, which sought information about Ethel—about whom it was ignorant. Hence the profile and the reply that she “did not work.” We need to recall the all-important fact that this cable did not include a code name—in contrast to other identified members of the spy group. And we must also remember that in order to be guilty of conspiracy, one must participate in at least one overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy. If the Venona decryptions fail to implicate Ethel, is there “abundant evidence,” as claimed, from the Soviet archives, thanks to Vassiliev? Klehr and Mark Kramer assert that Vassiliev’s documents “show that Ethel suggested other people Julius could recruit to turn over secret information.” However, a thorough search of the eight notebooks did not yield such evidence, nor is there any reference to it in Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev’s exhaustive Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America. The inference that she “suggested” names to the KGB is without foundation: There is no extant evidence of any liaison with a Soviet operative. Indeed, Julius’s Soviet handler from 1944, Alexander Feklisov, claimed that not only did he never meet Ethel but she was “completely innocent” and had nothing to do with the espionage. Rather than the case being closed on Ethel’s guilt, as alleged, the Gardner memorandum absolves her, as the FBI knew at the time of her execution. Now is the time for an historic injustice to be redressed. Now is the time for Joe Biden to issue a full exoneration or, at the least, a presidential pardon of Ethel Rosenberg.

        "title": "Novelist on a Deadline: Barry Malzberg, 1939–2024 | The Nation",
        "text": "Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access A speed demon at the typewriter, Malzberg wrote quickly and brilliantly in a variety of genres including mystery, thrillers, and erotica, but his core work was in science fiction. If your life absolutely depended on it, could you write a readable and publishable novel in 27 hours? In early February of 1969, that was the task an editor at Midwood books foisted on Barry Malzberg, then a 29-year-old rising star in the seedy world of the paperback quickie. Midwood specialized in soft-core erotic fiction, often with a sapphic bent. Over the previous year, Malzberg had proven his chops by knocking off seven novels for Midwood, writing under the pen names M.L. Johnson and Mel Johnson titles like I, Lesbian and Nympho Nurse. The editor was in a jam: He had promised the publisher too many titles, one of which he was planning on writing himself, called Diary of a Parisian Chambermaid, but the deadline loomed terrifyingly close as he had to prepare for a vacation in Argentina. The editor asked Malzberg if he could deliver the book in a few days. Malzberg, full of the impudence of youth, replied, “Try me.” On February 13, Malzberg sat down at the typewriter at 8 am and started banging away at his top rate of 60 words a minute, which gave him between 3,000 to 4,000 words an hour. Malzberg paced himself, taking time off to eat, go for a few walks, and sleep. He finished the book the next day, appropriately enough Valentine’s Day, at 11 am. From start to finish, the novel took him 27 hours, with 16 of those feverishly pecking at the typewriter. The book was duly published under the pen name Claudine Dumas and Malzberg collected his fee of $1,500, giving him 2.5 cents a word for a 60,000-word opus. Malzberg worked, he said, “at an hourly wage rate that would astonish even a teamster.” Malzberg, who died in a hospice in New Jersey on Thursday at the age of 85, flourished in the world of pulp fiction where quick writing was common: Malzberg’s friends Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg would both compile bibliographies of more than 500 titles. But even in that hurly-burly realm, Malzberg was a marvel. Reflecting on Diary of a Parisian Chambermaid in 2017, Malzberg told a podcast that, “in my opinion, with all deference to some writers we can name, it is the best novel written in 16 hours ever.” Malzberg did allow that Silverberg, if given a few days, could have written something superior. Although he never made great claims for such scutwork, Malzberg described Diary of a Parisian Chambermaid as “better than it has any right to be. It was readable.” The key fact about Malzberg was not just that he was fast—but that he was good. Perfectly readable was his baseline minimum, and when he was at his peak, he overshot that to achieve genuine brilliance. It’s easy enough to tote up evidence of Malzberg’s prolificity: In his peak decade, from 1967 to 1976, Malzberg wrote at least 68 novels and seven story collections along with scores of still uncollected stories published in many magazines and anthologies. He worked in a variety of genres, including mystery, thrillers, erotica, and adventure fiction, but his core work was in science fiction. Malzberg’s best science fiction novels—titles such as Beyond Apollo (1972), Herovit’s World (1973), Guernica Night (1975), and Galaxies (1975)—were astonishingly incisive critiques of modern technology and mass society. Intimately familiar with the genre, Malzberg used all the familiar SF tropes (space exploration, time travel, alternative histories) but amped them up with a bracing dose of pessimism and the stylistic bravura of literary modernism. Beyond Apollo tells the story of a doomed mission to Venus with an involuted, self-contradicting, sardonic, and half-mad narrator worthy of Samuel Beckett. Reviewing a Malzberg collection in 1980, the critic John Clute described “the sense of perplexity, of alarmed alienated implication, one feels on entering [Malzberg’s] calcined solipsistic universe.” This created, wrote Clute, “a world whose colors have been ashed down into a desolate, grey weirdly tonal inscape dominated” by a voice that was “grey, flat, intense, obsessive, unstoppable, almost always couched in the claustrophobic narrative-present tense, and seemingly humorless.” But that seeming lack of humor was, Clute went on to note, a misimpression. Once you caught the rhythm of his sly deadpan wit, Malzberg was also a hilarious writer. Along with his peers J.G. Ballard, Samuel Delany and Philip K. Dick, Malzberg was a central figure in the movement of science fiction away from the external world of adventure fiction and outer space into the psychological torments and struggles of inner space. Technology, these writers all understood, is not something external to humans but changes how we think and how we feel: The registering of technological change in the realm of emotional life was their literary project. Malzberg was a particularly kindred spirit to Dick, another speed demon—one who batted off books in a matter of weeks during amphetamine-fueled binge sessions at the typewriter. In an interview in the late 1970s, Dick said, “In all the history of science fiction, nobody has ever bum-tripped science fiction as much as Barry Malzberg.… he’s a great writer.” Dick and Malzberg were ambidextrous in the same way: With one hand they wrote as pulp writers, and with the other as literary modernists. Pulps and modernism are usually treated as mutually hostile traditions: In contrast to the slapdash outpouring of words from the pulp writers, great modernists such as Flaubert and Virginia Woolf are notorious for agonizing over their words—the endless and painful quest to locate le mot juste. Malzberg’s conflicting heritage of pulp fecundity and modernist ambition was rooted in his biography. Born in 1939—the son of a plywood salesman and a public school teacher—Malzberg aimed to be a writer from age 7. “I wanted to write because it was the only way I could deal with, control, and shape my experience,” he said in a 1979 interview. A classmate introduced Malzberg to science fiction magazines in 1951 and he soon became an avid reader. But it was a career as a literary writer in the mode of Norman Mailer or Philip Roth that he aimed for when he studied at Syracuse University in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where he won a Schubert Foundation fellowship for playwriting. But the struggle to write plays and stories for small literary magazines proved unappealing to the working-class writer—especially after he married and had two daughters. He took on a variety of day jobs, working as a welfare officer and also as an evaluator for the Scott Meredith literary agency. In that period he discovered that writers of real literary ambition were able to make a living writing for genre outlets, notably science fiction magazines. In a 1979 interview, Malzberg recalled that in 1965, “I was being rejected. I was writing literary short stories and drowning in rejections and I just did not want to go any further. In October or November of that year I read in Galaxy magazine Norman Kagan’s story ‘Laugh Along with Franz.’ It was a brilliant, savage piece of science fiction, except it wasn’t science fiction at all, it was a serious, savage work of American fiction by a young American fiction writer. I shook my head as I read it and I cynically said to myself, if this son of a bitch can get away with this kind of stuff in the commercial science-fiction genre then I’ve got a future.” Malzberg’s efforts to marry modernist literary values to the pulp tradition made him a polarizing figure in the SF world. While he was extravagantly praised by fellow writers such as Philip K. Dick, Brian Aldiss, and Theodore Sturgeon, Malzberg also provoked a backlash from those who objected to the bleakness of his vision. A powerful strain of American science fiction, written under the aegis of the influential editor John W. Campbell of Analog magazine, was ideologically committed to technological optimism. The space program, in Campbellian science fiction, was proof that humanity could be triumphant and conquer the universe. A life-long depressive, Malzberg had little use for can-do technological boosterism. In Malzberg’s gothic vision, technology was “the engines of the night”: the machines that can and probably will kill us. Ironically, in 1973 Malzberg’s Beyond Apollo won the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, created after the editor’s death. This provoked howls of outrage among science fiction traditionalists, who henceforth made Malzberg’s name a shorthand for the corrupting of the genre. In 1983, Carter Scholz wrote in The Comics Journal the single best appreciation of Malzberg. Scholz argued that the gothic vision of “the engines of the night” was aligned with the deepest currents of American fiction. According to Scholz: These are the engines of the night. These are the ageless horrific dreams of Washington Irving, the morbid fantasies of Poe, the dark fauns of Hawthorne, the crazed thunder of Melville, the wicked grin of Twain, the blood rituals of Lawrence, the mad fallen saints of Faulkner, the uprooted myths of O’Connor or Welty, the enervated hysteria of Oates, the lush obsessions of Hawks, the fragmentary scatology of Burroughs—this is the literary tradition of American SF [science fiction], and Malzberg has seen that, but he has seen also that it is not just a matter of art, no longer, it is a matter now of our blood; for the first time, the engines are not just in the mind’s night, for the first time in history they are being built. Technology is the expression of the Gothic dreams of the technicians. And the machines, by this reckoning, cannot fail to kill us. Malzberg knew the machines were changing us because he himself had been part of the process. To make a living as a pulp writer, he turned himself into a human machine—a kind of ChatGPT avant la lettre. This process of becoming a human text generator drove Malzberg, as himself admitted, half mad. It informs all his best work, giving them an authenticity of lived experience. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin By 1977, with the smash success of Star Wars, Malzberg’s somber and brooding fiction lost whatever cachet it once had. The dominant note of the genre returned to escapist adventure yarns. Malzberg, increasingly at odds with science fiction fans, wrote his last novel in 1983, although he continued to be a fecund writer of short stories. Malzberg’s dark vision did not win him a large readership, although he gathered around himself a cluster of young writers (notably Batya Swift Yasgur and Robert Friedman) for whom he was a mentor and sometime collaborator. Although he was a curmudgeon, Malzberg was much loved by those who knew him. Malzberg also lived long enough to see green shoots of his reviving literary reputation. Over the last few years, Stark House Press has been doing a diligent and commendable job of bringing his books back into print. Kent Worcester’s A Cultural History of the Punisher (2023) includes a fine appreciation of the “Lone Wolf” series of books Malzberg published in the 1970s under the name Mike Barry—a rare example of vigilante fiction with a stark left-liberal social conscience. There are signs here and there, especially among Youtube book channels, that his major works of the 1970s are being rediscovered. Barry Malzberg was an admirable writer, but not an easy one to emulate. I’ll shamefacedly admit that I spent far more time laboring over this obituary than he took in writing at least one novel.

Activate your online access Here are 20 of the best StudentNation articles from 2024 to highlight the extraordinary reporting of the next generation. Students at Columbia University’s Journalism School affix messages to their cap and gowns before accepting diplomas. Over the last twelve months, we’ve seen an extraordinary surge in student organizing around abortion rights, labor rights, climate change, and more in the lead up to the election. Of course, the broadest and most sustained student activism concerned the war on Gaza, with young people organizing to pressure their universities to divest from companies affiliated with Israel. In 2024, StudentNation published around 100 original articles by student journalists reporting on youth-oriented movements and issues across the country. We’ve selected 20 of the year’s best articles to highlight the extraordinary writing and reporting of the next generation. We’re deeply grateful to the Puffin Foundation whose great generosity to The Nation Fund for Independent Journalism made this work possible. “UChicago’s Arrest of Pro-Palestine Activists Shows Its Flimsy Commitment to ‘Free Speech,’” by Kelly X. Hui (January 16)After over two dozen students and faculty were arrested during a peaceful sit-in by UChicago United for Palestine, StudentNation writer (and later, Nation intern) Kelly X. Hui challenged the university’s reputation for being a leader on campus free speech. “Of course, UChicago’s tough response is not isolated, but part of a larger national campus crackdown,” wrote Hui, months before students would form Gaza Solidarity Encampments across the country. “In Ithaca, Climate Change Is Making Gentrification Worse” by Meher Bhatia (January 24)FEMA’s revised flood maps for Ithaca, New York—updated for the first time in over 40 years— significantly broadened risk zones enveloping the Southside neighborhood, a bastion of rich culture and Black heritage. But increases in housing and living costs, including flood insurance, threatened to push out longtime lower-income residents and undermine this sense of community, writes Meher Bhatia. “Brown University Students Are on a Hunger Strike for Palestine,” by Nicholas Miller (February 7) In early February, 19 students at Brown University began the largest hunger strike for Palestine in the United States since Israel’s war on Gaza began, refusing food until the university administration agreed to bring a resolution to divest its endowment from companies that provide weapons and equipment to the Israeli government. In April, the university agreed to a vote, but the Brown Corporation rejected the proposal in October. “The #NeverAgain Movement Six Years Later,” by Zachariah Sippy and Marie-Rose Sheinerman (February 14)A 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida galvanized hundreds of thousands of young people to push for stronger gun control measures. Six years later, Zachariah Sippy and Marie-Rose Sheinerman followed up with some of the student activists and co-founders of March for Our Lives to see how their thinking, strategy, and priorities have shifted. “The Mama Bears of Montgomery County, Texas,” by Yasmeen Khan (March 22)In 2022, three conservative Christian women with no prior political experience, calling themselves the “Mama Bears,” were elected to a school board in the ninth largest district in Texas. In the 2022-2023 school year, the district banned 59 books, more than any other in the greater Houston area. The year prior, they banned none. “After Texas’s DEI Ban, College Students Are Reconsidering State Schools,” by Aina Marzia (March 26)In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the state university system—including multicultural centers and campus identity groups. Two months after the law went into effect, StudentNation writing fellow Aina Marzia talked with current college students as well as high school students reconsidering their applications to in-state universities. “Inside Connecticut’s Fight to Expand Medicaid Coverage for Undocumented Immigrants,” by Kayla Yup (April 4)Connecticut expanded Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants up to age 12 in January 2023—the first time undocumented immigrants of any age could qualify for coverage from the state. More than 9,000 children benefitted from this expansion, and in 2023, the state passed a bill covering undocumented immigrants up to age 15. But it still falls short of advocates’ goals. “Healthcare should be a human right regardless of age, and especially immigration status,” said Najely Clavijo, an organizer for CT Students for a Dream. “Students at the University of Florida Passed a Historic Pledge for a Green New Deal,” by Cameron Driggers and Meagan Lamey (April 9)This year, the University of Florida became the first public university whose student government gave a direct mandate for a Green New Deal, calling for sweeping on-campus decarbonization, complete divestment from the fossil fuel industry, and restorative justice for marginalized communities most affected by the climate crisis. “Whether in conventionally blue states or red states, the march toward climate justice will continue,” wrote UF students Cameron Driggers and Meagan Lamey. Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin “Saving Paradise: The Fight to End Militarization in Hawai‘i,” by Saliha Bayrak (April 17)“Hawai‘i is the most densely militarized state in the nation. About 17 percent of the population is military-affiliated, and some 6 percent of the land is occupied by military bases,” wrote Saliha Bayrak. But activists with Hawai‘i Peace and Justice are working to have this land returned to the people of Hawai‘i. “The land is our actual ancestor. It is who we come from,” said Tia Marie Masaniai, a youth organizer with HPJ. “Inside the Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University,” by Lara-Nour Walton (April 19)While outside press access to Columbia University’s campus was restricted, student journalists continued to cover the formation of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, including StudentNation writer Lara-Nour Walton. The NYPD’s crackdown saw the largest mass arrests of student protesters since the war on Gaza began, but activists were not deterred. Less than two weeks later, Lara-Nour also documented the subsequent occupation of Hamilton Hall—the same building that anti-Vietnam War and anti-gentrification protesters occupied in 1968. “The Crackdown on Campus Protests Is Happening Everywhere,” by StudentNation (April 26)Following the dismantling of the Columbia encampment by the NYPD, students at dozens of other colleges—including the University of Minnesota, the University of Pittsburgh, Berkeley, and Yale—quickly established similar encampments. With calls for divestment growing louder, we asked more than a dozen students nationwide to share how their schools responded to protests. “I was one of three students suspended for the crime of speaking out against our university’s continued complicity in genocide, and now I’m banned from campus under the threat of arrest,” wrote Daniel Cázares at Washington University in St. Louis. “How Yale University Surveils Pro-Palestine Students,” by Theia Chatelle (May 20)Former StudentNation writing fellow Theia Chatelle used Connecticut’s Freedom of Information Act to obtain documents for The Nation showing a pattern of targeted monitoring of student protesters—from administrator presence at rallies to police surveillance of students’ social media accounts, to coordination between campus, local, and state police forces. “Surfers Are Fighting to Save the Waves—and the Planet,” by Ilana Cohen (May 28)By the end of the century, the world could lose almost half of its sandy beaches. But a movement of surfers across Latin America is working to protect the coastal-marine environment, writes Ilana Cohen. “Although a variety of indirect legal mechanisms for conserving waves have been identified globally, Peru is one of the only countries with a law dedicated to protecting surf breaks.” “As the NCAA Debates New Rules, Trans Athletes Are Left Out of the Conversation,” by Liam Beran (June 20)“At least 24 states have restricted transgender athletes’ participation in sports; 18 of those states specifically restrict college athletics,” wrote Liam Beran. Yet these policymaking decisions lack input from those most affected. “Often when we talk about trans people in sports, it’s kind of this abstract, like, almost mythologized, like, scary trans person,” Emmett Lockwood, a trans student athlete in Wisconsin, told Beran. “And I think a lot of times like, folks don’t realize that this is going to be impacting someone’s real life on the day to day.” “Donald Trump’s Secret Weapon to Dismantle American Education,” by Owen Dahlkamp (July 5)In a deep dive into Donald Trump’s “Agenda47,” Owen Dahlkamp shows how the former president’s plans for a second term could reshape American education and academic freedom as we know it. “Trump plans to shutter the Department of Education, restore prayer in schools, create an American Academy that awards low-cost degrees to students paid for by levying financial penalties against institutions that do not yield to his ideological standards, revitalize school choice, limit discussion of LGBTQ+ content in classrooms, and much more.” “Despite Bargaining Slowdowns, RA Unions Are Still Booming,” by Lucy Tobier (July 10)“Residential Assistant unionization campaigns have achieved historic success over the past two years, including job protections, sanctuary campuses, and new stipends,” wrote Lucy Tobier. In 2016, a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board recognized graduate and undergraduate students at private universities as employees, and organizers fear a reshaped NLRB under a second Trump term could undermine their strategy. “Our plan for that is not to be afraid or not to worry,” said Scott Williams, an organizer with OPEIU Local 153. “It’s to keep organizing as rapidly and as strongly as possible.” “Will the Closure of an Oil Refinery Bring Justice or Gentrification to Philadelphia?,” by Amber X. Chen (September 16)Four years after the largest oil refinery on the East Coast shut down, residents in South and Southwest Philadelphia are still worried about what will come next. “Decades of pollution have not only harmed the health of residents but also contaminated soil and bodies of water. How can people guarantee that their communities will be cleaned up? What will happen to all the jobs the oil refinery provided? And how can people ensure that the prosperity promised by a new development will not push residents out of the neighborhoods they have lived in for decades?” “The Hidden Barriers to Voting While Unhoused,” by Maggie Grether (October 23)Voter turnout is low among people experiencing homelessness. The most recent study on the topic, on the 2012 elections, estimated that only 10 percent of eligible voters experiencing homelessness actually voted—a fraction of the overall turnout of the country’s voting-age population. “Some may make a personal political choice not to vote. Others face barriers to registering and receiving election information without a permanent address,” wrote Maggie Grether. But even more pressing, experts say, is the widespread misconception that people cannot vote.” “Conservatives Are Trying to Trick Nebraskans Into Voting for an Abortion Ban,” by Annika Inampudi (November 1)Nebraskan voters found two competing abortion measures on their ballots this year—one pro-choice and one anti-choice. Leading up to November, anti-choice groups resorted to increasingly desperate tactics to confuse voters about which was which. “A recent advertisement put out by Protect Women and Children Nebraska mimics the imagery and language of the pro-choice movement.” On election day, the state voted to prohibit abortions after the first trimester. “If [these tactics are] successful here, they’re going to try this across the states,” said Allie Berry of Protect Our Rights, the group behind the pro-choice initiative. “The ‘Existential Threat’ Facing Ohio’s Public School System,” by Zurie Pope (December 2)Ohio now spends more than $970 million on private school voucher scholarships. In January 2022, a lawsuit challenging the state’s EdChoice voucher program was filed by a coalition of over 130 school districts across the state and is finally scheduled to go to trial next year. “Not only does this voucher program unconstitutionally usurp Ohio’s public tax dollars to subsidize private school tuitions, it does so by depleting Ohio’s foundation funding – the pool of money out of which the state funds Ohio’s public schools – otherwise available to already struggling school districts for the education of their students,” reads the lawsuit.

Activate your online access Former Black Panthers fear the FBI is still keeping tabs on them decades after COINTELPRO. In at least one case, they were right. Malik Rahim. On a warm afternoon in 1970, Cleo Silvers, then a young member of the Black Panther Party, boarded the subway from the Bronx to Harlem. COINTELPRO was at its height. Fred Hampton had recently been assassinated by police in Chicago. Huey Newton was imprisoned on false charges. She was still on the subway when police stopped her. “I told them, ‘I’m going to the Black Panther office, and you better leave me alone,’” recalled Silvers, now 78. And they did. By the time she got to the Panther headquarters on Seventh Avenue, she breathed a sigh of relief, and continued with her work: within a few months, she’d be helping to take over a hospital. Silvers recounted this day recently, sitting at her kitchen table, bedecked in a mauve headwrap and gold jewelry. Anyone looking in the window would see just another Tennessee academic, the rooms she shares with her husband, Ron, overflowing with books on racial justice and radical organizing. But Silvers’s life has been one of boldness: as a Young Lord in the South Bronx in 1970, she took part in the Lincoln Hospital Takeover, when activists demanded better care for patients, supported by Assata Shakur and other Panthers. After the takeover, Silvers helped run a door-to-door program with the Young Lords, testing people for tuberculosis and lead. Throughout this time, Silvers, like so many of her radical peers, was on the radar of the FBI. The bureau’s notorious COINTELPRO program—a campaign of covert and illegal operations aimed primarily at subverting civil rights and anti-war movements—was in full swing. Government operatives spied on, intimidated, smeared, harassed, blackmailed, wrongfully imprisoned, and assassinated dozens of Black leaders and radicals like Silvers until it was officially shuttered in 1971. Silvers’s name appears repeatedly in the 110,000-page cache of declassified FBI files on the Black Panthers, according to Bob Boyle, the attorney who obtained them. Decades later, congressional hearings and public apologies have served to frame COINTELPRO as a dark American chapter, one relegated to the dustbin of history. It’s 40 years since Silvers was last arrested and questioned about the Black Panther Party. About 45 years since the FBI visited her family to interrogate them about her whereabouts. More than 50 since she was betrayed by her own boyfriend, who she found out decades later was an FBI informant. And though the FBI’s pursuit of the Black Panthers officially ended, the government’s targeting and surveillance of radical activists never did. Silvers believes that she endured FBI harassment for decades following the official end of COINTELPRO. She told The Nation that FBI agents contacted her bosses and got her fired from multiple jobs, sometimes leveraging the federal grants that nonprofits needed to operate. When she was working for a workforce training program in 1995, she said, she was told by a friend that “the FBI came in and told [Silvers’s supervisor] that you were a Black Panther, and that it would be better for her to fire you than to lose the entire program.” Silvers was let go. (The person Silvers named as her former supervisor strongly denied to The Nation that this had occurred.) In 2002, Silvers said, she was working for Long Island University when her boss told her, “You are doing a wonderful job. But I have to ask you—what in the world did you do to the government? What did you do to the FBI? They are so angry at you.” Her boss went on, “They have come here and told me that I have to fire you.” She was let go again. As the NYPD discovered in 1971, Silvers doesn’t scare easily. But years of harassment left their mark. And today, daily, she feels the feds on her heels. “They continue to actively target us,” Silvers said. She believes her phones are still tapped and her apartment bugged. She sees people follow her into grocery stores, buy nothing, and follow her out. She is approached and befriended by strangers who then mysteriously disappear without a trace, sometimes after suggesting they jointly pursue some criminal venture (e.g., life insurance fraud). Wary, Silvers takes precautions. Sometimes she pours oil all over her trash, to spoil private documents and keep agents off the trail. Twice, she said, she’s seen Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) plates on SUVs that were following her: “I think they do it to let me know that they’re there.” To some, this might smack of paranoia. And at times, Silvers’s husband, Ron, is gently skeptical. When Silvers suggested that a neighbor had left a recorder in their couch, Ron disagreed, finding the speculation a step too far. But “the thing is, you really can’t tell,” he said. “From time to time, I have had the impression we’re being followed.” The Nation requested relevant public records in an attempt to prove, or disprove, Silvers’s suspicions. The TBI replied that “all TBI investigative records, both closed and open, are considered confidential.” A FOIA request regarding Silvers filed 17 months ago is still awaiting a response. Typically, any documents that come back are heavily redacted. In fact, it’s the uncertainty itself that contributes to the surveillance PTSD experienced today by aging Black activists like Silvers. Surveillance PTSD, also common among young men who’ve experienced multiple police stops, manifests as hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, and mistrust of formal institutions, including health clinics and banks. Sometimes it’s the very inability to know whether you’re really being watched, or you’re simply being paranoid, that is most unsettling of all. Frederika Newton, widow of BPP cofounder Huey Newton, still operates constantly under the assumption that she’s being surveilled. She knows that, as a result, some people might think the way she works is unusual. “Living with it so long, it’s hard to say how it’s affected me. It’s gotten so normalized,” she said, speaking by phone from Oakland, where she is president of the Dr. Huey P Newton Foundation, which aims to preserve Huey Newton’s legacy and correct decades of FBI-propagated disinformation about the Panthers. Today, she said, her younger colleagues, who never experienced the abject violence of 1960s COINTELPRO, “think I’m paranoid—that’s the only time I notice. My reality isn’t other people’s reality.” But of course, sometimes, you do get to know what’s true. On a warm winter afternoon, Malik Rahim hunched in his darkened living room in New Orleans, the walls plastered with decades of Black radical flyers and photographs, paging through a thin sheath of public records. Rahim, also a former Black Panther, is a renowned community organizer in New Orleans; he can’t walk a block without a car slowing to wave at him, one driver after another lifting fists of solidarity. He’s perhaps most known locally for founding the nonprofit Common Ground in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Common Ground and its health clinic served a half a million Katrina survivors in its first year. In 2019, Rahim received a Living Legend award from the Southern University of New Orleans honoring his work. In a box near his couch sits a framed Lifetime President’s Volunteer Service Award, recently received from President Biden. For years, Rahim had suspected—but never been able to prove—that the FBI had targeted him. Now, government documents showed that he was correct. Documents obtained last year by The Nation show that in August 2006, a year after Katrina, the New Orleans Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), a federal-police amalgamation led by the FBI, began conducting a “threat assessment” of Malik Rahim and Common Ground for “possible nefarious Domestic Terrorism or Anarchist activities.” Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin The JTTF’s report claimed that Common Ground was distributing “propaganda” and “anti-government posters.” Under a section titled “Intelligence Gaps,” the JTTF posed several questions, like: “Is Common Ground planning any terrorist attacks against Louisiana government facilities?,” and, “What anarchist groups and gangs, besides the New Black Panther party, is the Common Ground Collective recruiting from?” It ends with a request for the JTTF to conduct an investigation into Common Ground. Rahim was unaware of the FBI’s efforts until The Nation shared the files with him this year. “The FBI really put secret agents on us,” Rahim said, shaking his head. “I knew that they was planning on either killing me, or doing a character assassination, [but] this is really fucked up.” Here’s what Common Ground had actually achieved by August 2006: It had established a health clinic that served 15,000 residents; set up nine distribution centers; cleaned and gutted 1000+ homes and 12 churches; and served hundreds through the Common Ground Legal Team that monitored police harassment and abuse. They also distributed breakfast and had a kids’ bike shop and basketball tournaments. The revelation is all the more disturbing because Rahim had tried, with Common Ground, to be explicitly nonpolitical. “We didn’t get involved in no election, because our goal was just offering relief,” he said. Rahim noted that, contrary to the file’s claims, Common Ground had zero connections to the New Black Panther Party, which was founded in 1989 and is not related to the original BPP. Even before these latest revelations, Rahim had, for almost two decades, lived under the same kind of uncertainty as Silvers. In 2008, it was revealed that his former friend the Common Ground cofounder Brandon Darby had at some point turned on the organization and become a notorious FBI informant, likely in late 2007. Rahim’s voice was wounded as he explained how Darby’s betrayal affected him. It damaged Rahim’s relationship with his own son, who suspected Darby before his realignment became public. “I went against my own child” to defend Darby at the time, Rahim said. It appears that the FBI may have undermined Common Ground’s efforts even before Darby flipped. Rahim and Common Ground spent much of 2005 and 2006 repairing a low-income housing complex called The Woodlands, in order to prevent hundreds of residents from being evicted. The owner, Anthony Reginelli Jr., agreed for Rahim to purchase the complex for $5 million. But within weeks of the JTTF opening its investigation, Reginelli backed out of the deal and sold it to a property development group instead. The following month—just before Thanksgiving—all Woodlands residents received eviction notices. By January, hundreds were on the street. And the FBI wasn’t done with Rahim. In March 2007, it opened a mail fraud case against him under the heading “terrorism enterprise investigation.” The case remained open for more than a year, according to the declassified documents, with occasional updates that speculate about putting Rahim in front of a grand jury. The FBI finally closed the case in August 2008, noting that “no evidence has been collected.” At the time, Rahim had just launched a campaign for a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives as a Green Party candidate. Reginelli and his ex-wife, then co-owner of The Woodlands, told The Nation they did not recall speaking with the FBI. The other two then-owners of The Woodlands could not be reached for comment. As with Silvers, the surveillance of Rahim—and his uncertainty around it—has done lasting damage. Rahim sees threats all around him. He believes that white vigilantes poisoned his dogs last year—not so outlandish, considering that white vigilantes were shooting and killing unarmed Black New Orleanians in the wake of Katrina. On the day he went to accept his Living Legend award, his car was mysteriously towed. He says that officers from the nearby FBI fusion center jog past him on the levee and acknowledge him by name, just to let him know they know who he is. For decades, he’s been unable to get a passport or a driver’s license. And yet even with the sheath of records in hand, it’s difficult to ever know exactly what is deliberate targeting by police forces, what is the product of systemic racism, and what is simply the difficulty of navigating the daily indignities of US bureaucracy, magnified by the anxiety of a lifetime’s state targeting. Regardless, Rahim’s files lend credence to Silvers’s suspicions. Many aging Black Panthers remain active in justice organizing, and confer regularly on their efforts; Rahim visited Silvers’s apartment in New York City after Katrina as he sought to drum up support. And yet this reality hasn’t immobilized Rahim. In October, he received funding to establish a community center in Algiers, near his home. It will be the first time since the investigation of Common Ground that he will have a space dedicated to his organizing work. Rahim and Silvers are not outliers. The destabilization, the inability to know what’s real, to be haunted by uncertainty for decades—that’s the point. FBI briefs from 1971 describe their purpose as the inducement of “paranoia.” So COINTELPRO’s effects linger on, whether or not the program’s targets are still being actively surveilled by the state today. Frederika Newton says her past experiences manifest today as mistrust of strangers and hypervigilance. She “walks the straight and narrow,” and keeps meticulous records. “Most people don’t have their attorney in board meetings,” she pointed out. And, like Rahim in 2006, she is wary of becoming a target by being too noticeable. “Other people get elated when we raise money. I get nervous,” she said. Silvers is largely retired from organizing work, and often refers to her targeting with humor, rather than anxiety. But that doesn’t mean she feels safe. She still keeps an eye out for suspicious cars following her on her way to the grocery store, the nail salon, and the rehab center where she does physical therapy for her heart. She said her cardiac problems have been worsened by surveillance stress: “It’s still killing you, psychologically and physically, as you get older.” (The FBI has acknowledged the link between surveillance and debilitating stress in the past; according to a 1964 memo, the bureau took pride in hounding an elderly Puerto Rican activist so much he suffered a heart attack.) “It’s like microaggressions,” said Silver—painful in part because they are both ubiquitous and hard to prove. When Silvers and her husband, an interracial couple, found that their tire had been slashed in a Memphis parking lot, they could attribute it to coordinated state efforts to intimidate them—or to regular Klan members, all of it part and parcel of the legacy of racial terror in the US South. After all, when poison is in the atmosphere like that, it hurts everywhere. Whom can you trust? How can you know? How can it not drive you mad? “Some of them [activists] lost their minds because of that,” said Silvers. “Some of them are unable to function today. Some of them are hiding. They don’t want to be connected with anything that has to do with the movement. Many of them say, ‘I love you, Cleo, but don’t call me anymore.’” She sighed. “Because they’re afraid. Afraid.

Activate your online access Over the past decade, Massachusetts witnessed the slow death of its largest hospital chain, leaving the largest and most diverse neighborhood in Boston without essential care. A rally advocating to keep Steward hospitals Carney Hospital and Nashoba Valley Medical Center open on the front steps of the Massachusetts State House. Carney Hospital’s emergency department once served 31,000 patients a year. Now, it serves none. Over the past decade, Massachusetts witnessed the slow and painful death of its largest hospital chain. A few months ago, the Commonwealth finally laid it to rest, leaving a massive vacuum of care in its wake. After years of exploitative financial deals and patient care scandals, for-profit healthcare giant Steward declared bankruptcy in early May, leading to the permanent closure of Carney Hospital in Dorchester and leaving the largest and most diverse neighborhood in Boston without essential care. The massive building, which once bustled with patients, doctors, and staff, is now empty. On the door, a massive poster read “HOSPITAL CLOSED.” It directs patients to Milton Hospital, another healthcare facility over two miles away. Despite local advocates’ concerns about the closure, the government has remained uninvolved, leaving the region scrambling to find adequate care for its residents. In healthcare, two miles can mean life or death. A few months ago, Stephen Wood, a nurse practitioner in Dorchester’s Carney Hospital emergency department, saw a patient in critical condition. “[She] never would have made it past our hospital,” he says. “She would have died en route by an ambulance to any other hospital. She had minutes to live.” The decision to close Carney shocked local residents as well as employees, and will lead to an exodus of healthcare workers from Dorchester, Wood explains. “The services that our hospital provided, they’re all going away, and they’re going to different communities.” “We were literally just pulled into a room,” Wood says. “Not by any administrators, not by anyone from Steward in an executive position. We were told by a colleague.” By announcing their August 31 closure on July 31, Steward broke the Massachusetts law requiring 120 days notice when essential health services are terminated. Many of the workers decided to take action. “I scheduled a protest as soon as I heard that.” At the protest, dozens of healthcare workers and local community members alike came out to show how important Carney Hospital was for them. “These are the people who haven’t given up,” Wood says. “They’re taking time out of their busy lives to come out and just show people that, you know, we’re not going down without a fight, and we deserve better than this.” In mid-August, Governor Maura Healey announced that Massachusetts would seize St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center—another Steward Hospital—and protesters demanded that the state do the same with Carney. “In [seizing St. Elizabeth’s], we are protecting access to care in those communities and preserving jobs, jobs of thousands of hard-working women and men who work at these hospitals,” Healey said. But this protection was not applied uniformly across the state. Around 1,200 employees will lose their jobs due to the Steward bankruptcy crisis. Resident doctors have been transferred to neighboring hospitals that lack the teaching infrastructure to further their education. Nurses and other healthcare workers are still fighting to receive full severance pay for all former workers of Carney. More than 150,000 people live in the Dorchester and Mattapan areas, and their access to care will be limited by the hospital’s closure. Though Carney was determined to be “an essential service” by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Healey has not put it under eminent domain. Unlike St. Elizabeth’s, no buyers stepped up for Carney, and the state didn’t want to indefinitely manage the hospital. “The state cannot run a hospital. Hospital systems have to run hospitals,” Governor Healey said during a press conference. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health runs four hospitals, including Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, which has 248 beds and “helps economically and socially disadvantaged patients to get high quality, cost-effective care from a staff that respects their dignity,” according to the DPH website. Carney Hospital had around 150 licensed beds at the time of its closure. While this crisis unfolds, Healey has not visited Carney Hospital, nor the protests. “She had a responsibility here to do something to try to save these safety net hospitals,” Wood says. “There was plenty of opportunity for her to have done something for a decade, and she’s chosen to turn a blind eye.” Before Steward’s involvement, Carney was a lively community hospital, according to Karl Odom. He worked as a cardiopulmonary technician at Carney for 46 years and lived in Dorchester for even longer. “The doctors grew up around there, the nurses, everyone that worked there, [there were] whole families who worked at Carney Hospital,” Odom says. “I could see when patients came in, they felt that they were coming into a place that was concerned for them.” Months after the closure, a Facebook group of over 1,500 members titled “Carney People” remains active. Members post photos and relay information about receiving benefits or compensation for the Steward crisis. Mostly, old employees reminisce over their time in the hospital fondly. “I wonder how many of us met our spouses at Carney,” one member wrote. “I can think of a few, lol.” The post has over 40 comments, each person recounting stories of Christmas parties, the Carney float at the Dorchester Day Parade, and even meeting their husbands in the hallways. Once Steward rolled in, the culture changed dramatically. “I had patients who would ask, ‘Who is this Mr. Steward?’—they wanted to talk to him personally,” Odom says. The environment “just wasn’t customer-friendly.” Carney used to hold Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, smoking cessation classes, and other support groups in the building after operating hours. As Steward took hold of the hospital, these community-centered events disappeared. There were fewer community outreach liaisons, and fewer hospital administrators in general, Odom said. “After a while, the people that came in, they would look at the folks that worked there…and they say, we’ve never seen a sadder group of people.” In the years that followed Steward’s acquisition of Carney, the hospital was understaffed and ill-equipped. Nurses were overworked and burnt out. Steward began to hire per diem workers—who weren’t familiar with the community—to care for patients. Fewer physicians had to see even more patients. Over time, the standard of care worsened. Steward soon fell behind on paying bills, and vendors began to repossess vital medical devices. Doctors became responsible for ensuring that they had enough supplies—a relatively easy task for Odom, a technician, but much harder for those in the emergency department. “You always were scrounging around for anything,” he says. “People could see it. And once the community saw it, they got a little skittish and they went elsewhere.” The dissolution of Carney happened slowly. People realized that Steward was in trouble, but they thought Carney would somehow make it out. “People didn’t believe that in healthcare someone would be that callous and let hospitals and sick people just die,” Odom says. “It can’t be a business. Healthcare can’t be a business.” Bill Walczak has been community organizing in Dorchester since the 1970s. As a young man, he became the chair of a committee turning a recently closed library into a health clinic. This volunteer position eventually turned into his role as the founder and director of the Codman Square Health Center. “I accidentally got pushed into the healthcare system and wound up staying in it for 42 years,” he says. “It doesn’t make sense to people like me, in the public health world, that we would allow a community hospital in a low-income area with poor health outcomes to close.” In the 1980s, the patient population of Dorchester began to shift from insured government and union workers to African Americans migrating from the South, many of whom were uninsured. Carney hesitated to adapt to the changing patient demographics, which made it very difficult for the hospital to break even, said Walczak. Dorchester remains the neighborhood with the highest percentage of Medicaid patients in Boston. Even before the hospital system declared bankruptcy, Steward claimed that “low reimbursement rates” from the state insurance were responsible for lower quality of care. In a January statement to WBUR Boston, Steward claimed that “most community hospitals—including Steward hospitals in Massachusetts—are suffering losses that jeopardize their ability to continue to offer services,” due to the state’s inability to raise insurance reimbursement rates. In response to declining funds, Carney Hospital’s former owner, Caritas Christi, produced a 2006 report recommending the addition of acute long-term care services, additional oncology programs, and more imaging centers to improve revenue. Eventually, Caritas Christi CEO Ralph De La Torre decided that the hospital system needed an infusion of cash to grow. He partnered with Cerberus Private Equity, with the intention of buying struggling nonprofit hospitals and turning them into for-profit health centers. This new company was called Steward Health Care, and claimed that it would implement the recommendations of the 2006 report. Within a few years, it became clear that nothing would change. “The issues have been similar for a really long time,” Walczak says. Long before Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was killed walking into an investor meeting in New York City with bullets that read “delay,” “deny,” and “depose,” Massachusetts struggled to deal with the consequences of privatized healthcare. Cerberus profited immensely from this perpetually struggling hospital system. Shortly after the purchase, the company began implementing a controversial private equity strategy: sale leaseback. Steward sold Carney Hospital’s land to a real estate investment trust, then leased it back to the hospital. This put Carney under a triple net lease, meaning that instead of owning the land, Carney was now responsible for paying rent, property taxes, and maintenance costs. Sale leasebacks saddle many hospitals with more costs than they can handle, Mary Bugbee of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project said, especially for safety net hospitals with low margins. The extra costs cut into funds that could go to patient care, more competitive wages, and other capital improvements. “It’s fundamentally extractive,” she said. The real estate investment trust ended up buying the land of all Steward hospitals for $1.2 billion. Almost half of the proceeds of the transaction, $484 million, went to paying Cerberus investor dividends. All the while, hospitals were struggling to balance rising costs and patient care. During the onset of the pandemic, Cerberus exited its investment. In the decade that Cerberus owned Steward, its investors made $800 million. Moreover, the company paid $111 million to Steward’s ownership. “Our system is completely and utterly broken,” Bugbee says. “It all comes down to profit, and prioritizing profit over patients, and not having enough guardrails from the states.” In September, Governor Healey announced the creation of a “working group” to research and address healthcare needs in the Dorchester community. The 1199SEIU healthcare workers union successfully negotiated for former employees of Carney Hospital to have their full PTO paid out, but many are still getting far less than what they are owed. Smaller community health centers in Dorchester have yet to receive any meaningful support. Now that the hospital has officially shut down, it’s unlikely that it can be seized by eminent domain. The community has been grieving, as Karl Odom puts it. “They lost this job—the job really was their family,” he says. “It is going to be a long time before some people forget what happened and recover from it.” Milton saw an increase in 20 to 40 emergency visits in the two weeks after Carney’s closure, and has recently requested to double its emergency department because of the rising demand. Smaller health clinics like the Codman Square Health Center have also reported an increase in patients following Carney’s closure. “Our local healthcare system does not have the primary care and urgent care capacity to replace the now-lost Carney services,” wrote Walczak in a column for the Dorchester Reporter. He explains that the community is not prepared to handle urgent care without Carney’s emergency department. At the end of the column, he writes: “A rebuilding of community health capacity is now essential to create a healthcare system for this large part of metro Boston. The community’s residents and healthcare experts—not those who turned their backs on our community—should lead this effort.” Sasha Abramsky Branko Marcetic Elie Mystal Dave Zirin In healthcare, these exploitative practices are pervasive. Across the country, 460 hospitals are owned by private equity, with a company called Apollo Global Management owning around half. Apollo-owned hospitals have received complaints of understaffing, lack of resources, and poor quality of care—all complaints that Steward once received. And over the past few months, Apollo bought the real estate of all Steward-owned Massachusetts hospitals. “The Massachusetts State legislature just missed a huge opportunity to regulate these types of transactions. Their session closed without any sort of, you know, forward-looking legislation that would prevent another Steward crisis,” Bugbee says. “Unless our state legislators and federal legislators do something about it, this tactic is going to continue.” Private equity hospitals are less safe for patients, according to a Harvard Medical School study. After analyzing millions of hospitalizations, researchers found an increase in hospital-acquired infections in private equity owned facilities. Rhode Island, after facing a similar crisis, enacted a law that would allow the state’s attorney general to closely review any substantial transactions involving for-profit hospitals. California’s state legislature proposed a law that would give the state power to block a private equity healthcare transaction entirely, which was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Even after the fallout of the Steward bankruptcy crisis, Massachusetts has not enacted any meaningful legislation to protect healthcare workers or patients from private equity healthcare transactions. Steward’s exit has created a vacuum of care in Massachusetts—a gap that may not be filled for many years. Despite this, Odom remains optimistic that Dorchester, a community of tough people, he says, will survive the closure. “When they like you, you want ’em in front of you, because they’ll go through a brick wall for you. But they fight when they have to.” Annika Inampudi is a 2024 Puffin student writing fellow covering science, health, and technology for The Nation.

        "title": "Essential Quincy Jones-Produced Songs to Add to Your Playlist",
        "text": "During his prime, Quincy Jones helped write, compose, and arrange some of the greatest pop hits in modern history for some legendary artists, including Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Donny Hathaway, and many more. As a way to remember Jones, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will honor Jones at the 2025 Oscars. This is why it’s perfect that we revisit the playlist of some of the most essential Quincy Jones songs that represent the incredible mark he left on a generation of music fans. We’ll try to keep it to one song per artist since Jones produced entire albums for some of the singers on this list. It’s hard to choose just one Michael Jackson hit for this list, considering Jones produced many of them, including “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” “Dirty Diana,” and “Bad.” But with Halloween just passing, this felt like a perfect choice. Yes, that’s right. Quincy Jones produced the song that helped bring the world together in 1985 to help raise money for the famine going on in Ethiopia at the time. Released on the album of the same name, “Give Me the Night” was one of the first albums Jones released on his new label Qwest Records. While Benson sounds great on this record, the production on this song is immaculate. It speaks to Jones’ longevity that he produced a song for the Weekend as recently as 2022 and a song for Ray Charles back in 1961. Few people in any industry have had the privilege of being able to create art for that long. The cover of Shuggie Otis’ 1971 is likely just as popular as the original due in part to Jones’ updated production. He doesn’t do anything out of the ordinary but it just shows that Jones wasn’t afraid to take inspiration from the past and improve on it. Quincy Jones had the pleasure of producing Donna Summer’s self-titled tenth studio album. This particular song not only showcases Summer’s incredible voice but also embodies everything the 80s was about. Just listen and you’ll understand. Jones does an incredible job of combining Franklin’s voice with the production, which makes it difficult at times to decipher her voice from another instrument. It’s the sign of a true musical genius. This 1972 soul song is amazing not only because it sounds great, but because it speaks to those who grew up underprivileged and fought to do better in life. Another example of Jones’ versatility. He could produce songs for R&B and soul artists with a hand tied behind his back, but his ability to create a record for someone as unique as Little Richard truly exemplifies how special Quincy was. In the middle of The Beatles reign as the most popular act in music, Jones produced “You Don’t Own Me,” which went on to become one of Lesley Gore’s most memorable hits and his since been covered several times by many other artists. While this song may not be as popular as other records on this list, it’s beloved by longtime fans of the popular ABC soap opera “General Hospital. When it was released in 1982, it didn’t perform well. But when it became the theme song for Luke Spencer, a character on the show, the record grew in popularity. It’s best we end this list with a record that has no vocals. Few producers can create a song that needs no words but yet can say so much. That’s what this upbeat song does.",

        "title": "15 Moments That Made This Black History Month Black AF",
        "text": "One thing is absolutely for certain, President Donald Trump was NEVER going to get in the way of Black folks celebrating Black History Month. However, this February in particular just felt... eeeextra Black. You feel me? Typically, Black History Month is flooded with small history lessons, remembering our ancestors and prominent leaders as well as acknowledging the Black firsts of every category of life. However, what made this month special were the series of events that occurred that shined a light on how brilliant (and gangsta) the Black community is. From amazing celebrity wins and performances to local residents showing up and showing out, this Black History Month has been Black AF! Keep scrolling to see 15 moments to remember from this year’s celebration. 2 / 17 In the first few days of Black History Month, a group of neo-Nazi’s marched with their swastika flags onto the bridge floating above Interstate 75 in Cincinnati so that every driver could see their emboldened hate, per KEPR TV. Once the Black residents caught wind of it, not only did they confront them and demand they leave but they also snatched up their flags and set them ablaze. They found out exactly who they were taunting that day. 3 / 17 We understand there’s some drama surrounding the #HillmanTok University trend but let’s acknowledge how powerful it was when it started! Thanks to a TikTok from Dr. Leah Barlow, a professor of Intro to African American Studies class at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Black people were inspired to create their own HBCU online. The trend connected hundreds of thousands of educators across a wide variety of subjects to TikTok users with 10-minute, information-packed mini lectures. This trend was not only proof of how educated our community is but how powerful we can be if we put our minds together. 4 / 17 “They used say I spoke too country. Then the rejection came, said I wasn’t country ‘nough,” sang Beyoncé in her intro track to “Cowboy Carter.” Not only was her album a statement about reclaiming space in music genres that Black people invented but it was a jab at her previous experience at the CMA’s, where she was met by a stiff neck crowd who believed she didn’t deserve to be there. Why? Because she’s Black. Jokes on them! “Cowboy Carter” took home a Grammy for Album of The Year becoming the second Black woman to do so and Best Country Album, becoming the first Black woman to do so. 5 / 17 Kendrick Lamar’s single “Not Like Us” was not just a single obliterating rap rival Drake but it was a message about cultural appropriation in Hip Hop. The song transcended its catchy tune into commercials, music videos, an epic west coast Juneteenth celebration and more. The song’s influence landed four Grammys this year for Best Rap Song, Best Song, Best Music Video and Best Rap Performance. Everyone present for the award show couldn’t help but bop to it every time Kendrick went up to grab his trophy. 6 / 17 Speaking of Lamar, can we talk about how gangsta this Super Bowl performance was? “The revolution bouta be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy,” the rapper bellowed in the introduction to his performance. His set was packed with symbolism almost as if he wanted y’all to keep talking about it after it was over. Samuel Jackson’s chilling narrations as “Uncle Sam,” an all Black dance team making up the colors of the American flag, Serena Williams crip-walking on Drake’s grave, calling out the unfulfilled promise of giving Black folks 40 acres and a mule all in front of President Donald Trump?! - I mean, he proved why he won that Pulitzer. 7 / 17 As we continue of the topic of the Super Bowl, let’s congratulate this majority-Black team for their epic win. They swatted away questions about President Trump’s presence at the game, WHOOPED the Kansas City Chiefs by the second quarter and took home the win. Not only did they win, Philadelphia won. 8 / 17 Despite being on the losing team for the Super Bowl, this once in a lifetime opportunity was a true blessing for DeAndre Hopkins. Before professional football, he was the son to a mother who was the survivor of an acid attack, Sabrina Greenlee. Amidst her struggle to recover, he went as far as saving her from taking her own life, Greenlee told The Root. Even before the Super Bowl, he contemplated if football was even for him until he received the blessing of being drafted to the Kansas City Chiefs. They might have lost but Hopkins still had a win. 9 / 17 Where do we even begin? Onijah Robinson took over the internet after flying to Pakistan to marry a 19-year-old man she fell in love with online, per The Express Tribune. However, when the man’s family took him into hiding on her arrival, Robinson refused to leave. Instead, via various local interviews, she demanded money, land and a flight back home to New York. Her northeast attitude in a foreign place had social media users both entertained and worried for her. Reports say on her way back to the U.S., she was detained in Dubai. Though, we don’t really know where she is now. 10 / 17 The only other women to receive a Grammy for Best Rap Album were Lauryn Hill and Cardi B, who presented the award for Florida-native rapper Doechii. Ever since the drop of her album “Alligator Bites Never Heal,” Doechii has been getting win after win including but not exclusive to landing a feature with Tyler the Creator, collab with Issa Rae and a viral performance on “The Late Show.” She deserves all of her flowers! 11 / 17 Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett has been calling out the BS from the Trump administration. However, her voice has become even louder when holding the president accountable of things such as his bogus war on diversity, equity and inclusion or allowing Elon Musk to do whatever he pleases in the makeshift Department of Government Efficiency. In her interviews this month with The Breakfast Club and The Root, she told it like it is. Unfortunately, she may be one of the only legislators doing so. 12 / 17 Not every hero wears a cape. In this case, the hero was a 10-year-old boy in Philadelphia who went out of his way to save his younger sister the moment a medical plane crashed in the city. He moved his 4-year-old sister out of the way so she wouldn’t get hit with the debris from the plane. Instead, he suffered a critical injury to the head after being struck with a piece of metal. We’re praying for his recovery as he remains in critical condition, per 6 Action News. 13 / 17 What a great month for Hip Hop. A$AP Rocky was looking at some serious time in the aggravates assault case against him. A former friend accused the rapper of shooting him back in 2021, dragging A$AP to trial. Once the jury came back with a not guilty verdict, the rapper melted into joy, climbing over the benches to hug his girlfriend and singer Rihanna. Fans were relieved after holding their breath for weeks of trial. 14 / 17 It’s her time to shine. Zaya Wade’s big break out happened this month as she covered the face of Seventeen Magazine. The 17-year-old received criticism from a young age for being into dresses and makeup as a boy. The now-trans girl is making a name for herself with her new identity and boldly stepping forward despite the challenges facing her. 15 / 17 DJ Mustard didn’t just receive hype for producing “Not Like Us,” he also received a rather obnoxious shoutout from Kendrick Lamar on his song “tv off” where he screams, “MUSTAAAAAARRRDDDDDD.” Naturally, Heinz nudged the music producer to take part in a cheeky collaboration. 16 / 17 Remember the Black church in Washington, D.C. that the Proud Boys vandalized during the 2020 protests? Well, a superior court judge granted the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church right to the trademark of the far-right conservative group’s name. Now, the group is banned from selling merch with their name or symbol on it without the church clearing it first. They can also seize any profits from the sales as well. Sweet, sweet revenge. 17 / 17",

        "text": "The Economic Blackout, sponsored by The People’s Union USA, takes place today, Feb. 28. The peaceful protest is an attempt to disrupt corporations that have dropped their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs (DEI), by holding back spending. Those participating in the boycott hope to make their frustrations felt, and if you have no clue as to what is going on, here’s what you need to know. This economic blackout is not just talk going around on social media — millions of Americans have pledged to take part. The boycott has received nods of support from many notable people, including Rev. Al Sharpton, who has even expressed interest in creating his own boycott with the National Action Network (NAN). 221 likes, 23 comments - real_sharpton on February 26, 2025: \"When DEI is under attack, what do we… The main goal of the boycott is to remind those in charge that “we the people” hold the real power, as stated by TikTok user @ms.fueg: The goal is to not spend any money today, if you can help it. No gas, no fast food, no impulse online purchases. Don’t tap that your phone and don’t swipe that bank card. It may be difficult to go a full day without spending one dollar on an essential item or food,  therefore there is the tiniest bit of leeway. Small family owned businesses are not on the boycott list, even better if they are Black owned. User @askabout.amanda shares how she believes the boycott is performative in a TikTok, and though it’s true that one day of boycotting may not be the most effective way of sending across a message, it’s ability to set a precedent is undeniable. The result? The start of more conscious spending habits. The People’s Union USA, a grassroots organization that is in charge of the boycott, stated that they plan to promote weeklong boycotts, as said in PBS News, therefore this might only be the start. Rev. Al Sharpton’s boycott, for example, plans to target businesses that do not follow DEI programs throughout the spring. The companies that his boycott will be targeting are set to be announced in April, stated by the NAN website.",

        "title": "The Feb. 28 Economic Boycott is Not the Move...Here's Why",
        "text": "The right protest has the potential to bring a nation to its knees, change laws and policies forever; and cement a spot in our history books. This one-day economic boycott on Friday (Feb. 28) won’t be one of those protests. Let me tell you why. The reasoning behind the one-day boycott happening Friday is simple: When Trump came into office, he took aim at Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the federal government. Following his lead, corporations like McDonalds and Walmart began rolling back DEI initiatives in their stores. Target did the same, but later allegedly apologized but then maybe didn’t? (Honestly, I’m not sure how to feel about the corporation whose man headquarters are in the hometown of the man who purified himself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.) Black folks led the charge in calling for people to stop shopping at places that did away with DEI. White folks have jumped on board and now there are plans  for a boycott of places like McDonald’s any other corporation that is following the 47th president’s lead. The irony is that Meta is also rolling back their diversity initiatives, but there is scarcely a word about leaving Instagram and Facebook. In fact, they are using those platforms to organize this boycott. This is all fine and good....I mean, white folks jumping on board an idea that Black folks had is not new. But here’s the thing, and I’ve said this before, but it needs to be underlined, highlighted and put in bold: The boycott cannot just be one day. Not if anyone wants it to work. Organizing a group of people — especially folks who look like us — is a major undertaking. We fall into habits unthinkingly. We drive the same route home because its comfortable. We wear the same clothes when we get home because it comfortable. We shop at the same store because, you guessed it, we find it comfortable. We like don’t like things to be hard. We don’t want to change our patterns. That’s why the Montgomery Bus Boycott is so notable. Not only were the participants of that boycott able to get people to change their patters and embrace discomfort to cause change, but they were also able to get protesters who walk miles daily to accomplish their goal. That’s significant. That dedication and tenacity is what made the city of Montgomery bend to their will. The same kind of dedication will be needed if the people behind this week’s protest want to be successful…but I have doubts. Sure, you can get people to change their shopping habits for one day. But what happens after that? Remember the Women’s March and the pu**yhats? That fizzled out because there was no real plan beyond that one-day protest. What about Occupy Wall Street? What happened to that movement? Even the Pro-Palestinian wave of support that swept college campuses last Spring fizzled out over the Summer….why? Because to keep people engaged is hard. Especially now, with social media competing for our attention. To make corporations listen to us, we must do more than boycott their stores for one day. Billion-dollar corporations can survive a 24hour hit to their bottom line. We must be willing to walk away from them for weeks and months if necessary. But I’m not hearing anyone say they are willing to do that. So I’ll join y’all in the protest this Friday, but don’t expect any major changes. That’s going to take more than just shopping at Costco on Feb. 28. ",

        "text": "Sean “Diddy” Combs isn’t the only one dealing with legal issues. The hip-hop mogul’s mother, Janice Combs, is also having to fight serious allegations after one of the co-founders of Bad Boy Entertainment is accusing the 84-year-old of fraud. On Wednesday, Kirk Burrowes, the former president of Bad Boy, filed a lawsuit against Combs, claiming that she secretly gained control of his 25 percent stake in Bad Boy after her son forced him to sign over his share after he was physically threatened, according to Rolling Stone. Although Burrowes lost his stake in the company more than two decades ago, he learned about Janice’s role in the alleged fraud recently. He claimed an investigation last year revealed evidence that she “unlawfully” gained control of his shares. More from Rolling Stone: The new lawsuit filed Wednesday by lawyer Tyrone Blackburn claims Burrowes was “ruthlessly betrayed” by Janice when she allegedly conspired with her son to consolidate power and exclude him from the company that he helped start. Janice, identified in the lawsuit as Janice Smalls, purportedly shifted blame entirely onto her son as she remained in contact with Burrowes over the ensuing years, his lawsuit claims. “Smalls carefully maintained a facade of integrity, portraying herself as an innocent bystander while orchestrating plaintiff’s financial and professional downfall behind the scenes,” the 53-page filing obtained by Rolling Stone states. “Through false assurances and calculated deceit, defendant Smalls led plaintiff to believe that she had no knowledge of the fraudulent transfer, effectively suppressing any opportunity for plaintiff to reclaim his rightful stake in [Bad Boy].” Burrowes claims that years after he lost his stake in Bad Boy, Janice continued to tell him that she would help him gain it back. However, she never did, and he was instead left “destitute,” according to Rolling Stone. Burrowes has previously filed a lawsuit that is related to his loss in ownership. In 2003, he accused Diddy and attorney Kenneth Meiselas of threatening him with a baseball bat in 1996 to sign over his shares. He claims he lost $25 million as a result. The suit was later thrown out due to the statute of limitations.",

        "text": "These days, TikTok is a one-stop shop for everything from the latest celebrity tea to a lesson in Black history. Now, millions of people are also turning to the platform to help them learn a little more about their favorite songs, thanks to Jarred Jermaine. The 37-year-old Bay Area native, who calls himself the CEO of music and audio knowledge, has built a massive social media following, including over six million followers on TikTok and three million on Instagram. Followers are obsessed with his seemingly endless database of musical information. Jermaine started in the business as a producer making beats for local artists. His passion for music eventually brought him to Los Angeles where he got a job at Power 106, the local urban radio station. He told The Hollywood Reporter he started making content for TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was turning to social media for entertainment. “It started in quarantine. It was 2020 and I was just really bored. I was trying to do funny comedy skits first on TikTok. That’s what everybody was doing. But I was like, ‘Bro, I’m not King Bach. What am I good at? I’m really good at music. I hear things really good.’ ” he said. One of Jermaine’s first successful posts showed followers that Wiz Khalifa’s 2018 track, “Something New,” sampled Zapp & Roger’s 1980s R&B hit “Computer Love.” The 2020 post has since received over 350,000 likes and inspired Jermaine to create follow-up posts citing other modern hip-hop songs that sampled the classic track. Jermaine says he was surprised to find such a large following who were interested in what he does with his friends all the time. “People want to know samples? I do this all day in my car with my friends. All right,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “So I just wrote more samples down. I wrote down 50 videos, and then I just did one a day. I haven’t had a day without 1 million views since that day.” In another popular post, Jermaine shows followers examples of hip-hop and R&B songs that have sampled hits by Luther Vandross. Since its 2002 launch, Apple’s Shazam app has helped people identify over 100 billion songs. But let’s face it, there are some tunes that even Shazam can’t name – that’s where Jarred Jermaine comes in. He has an uncanny ability to help people identify songs they can’t seem to get out of their heads – even if they can only hum a few bars. Followers can tag him when they need his expertise. Check this out and prepare to be amazed: “Bros providing a service” wrote someone in the comments.",

        "title": "15 Experiences All Black People Share and Can Relate To",
        "text": "Black History Month isn’t just about highlighting the rich history of our community in the United States of America. The month is also dedicated to embracing our culture and the fact that some things Black people relate to in a unique, niche way. Social media has flooded with memes like “Black people for no reason” or “Black people when they ...” providing simple yet hilarious scenarios that remind us just how connected we are. All of us have had to plop on the floor in between auntie’s legs to get our hair braided. All of us have a unique language in how we tell stories or switch of tone when we talk to white people. These experiences, whether they draw upsetting or joyful memories, are what makes our community so precious. Scroll down this list and see the many experiences Black people had and continue to share over generations. 2 / 17 For the southern folk, we definitely got sat on a chair and handed a bowl of green beans  to snap to help along the cooking process. 3 / 17 If you weren’t cooking the collards yourself, you can bet that whoever was would snatch you from what you were doing to cut these stems and wash these leaves. 4 / 17 You don’t know pain until you’ve grown stiff after sitting on the ground in between someone’s legs, getting your hair braided and having your head tossed from side to side for God knows how long. (Then they’d have the nerve to squeeze their thighs together to lock you in place so you wouldn’t move, or was that just my trauma?) 5 / 17 Some of our best memories with family is when we were just little toddlers splashing around in the bathtub. Why separate us from our cousins when our mothers and aunties could kill two  birds with one stone? 6 / 17 One of the most hilarious social media trends was discussing our “units of measure” - which is basically how we preface a given quantity of something. “She brought all 50lemn of them kids.” “They fit damn near everything in that truck.” “I haven’t seen you in a month fulla Sundays!” These are just a few examples. 7 / 17 A niche experience for Black women, whether natural hair or processed. There is nothing more humbling than waking up in the morning thinking your flexi rod set or braid out was going to be cute and being forced to choose between a puff or slick back bun as an alternative... and with only minutes to get ready. 8 / 17 Black people can’t just tell a story. They have to insert a sound bite to continue things on and keep you captivated. Whether it’s starting the tale off with, “Aight, so boom,” or interjecting “bah bah bah” for your typical “so on and so forth,” we have a unique way of keeping one engaged. 9 / 17 Unfortunately, part of the Black experience in America is being seen as suspicious or up to no good just based off our skin color. One experience many of us share is being followed around by a store employee who more than likely assumes we were trying to steal from their store. 10 / 17 Mannnn there’s nothing like those hot summer days when sitting out on the porch or on the grass to feel the breeze had to suffice when the AC wasn’t pushing anything. Porch conversations made for the best laughs and THEE best tea. 11 / 17 In any Black household, there is 100 percent a chance you will go toward the variety butter cookie container on the counter all to open it and find sewing supplies. Don’t even get me started on the repurposed butter containers for leftovers, Lord. 12 / 17 Black people know how to talk without having to say NOTHING. Whether it’s your friend trying to tell you somebody y’all talked about just walked in the room or your mother shooting you a threatening glance when you’re acting up, you know what the look is when you get the look. 13 / 17 If you want to look for clothing, makeup and hell, even cooking recipes, you will more than likely have to add the words “Black people” or “Black-something” to your search bar to get what you’re really looking for. Pinterest girlies, you know what I mean. 14 / 17 Black people in corporate, stand up! We have learned that sometimes, the phone call, meeting and “Good morning” greeting have to be in a cadence and tone easy for a white person to digest. Our AAVE won’t cut it in the office or other professional settings for the fear of being stereotyped... or because sometimes white folks genuinely don’t know what we’re saying. 15 / 17 Black people in the evening sun is unmatched. If you thought you looked good when you got ready in the morning, just wait until that orange-toned sunset beam rests on your brown skin. That glow is different. 16 / 17 You ever walk into a place with tons of white folks and your eyes dart around to see if any Black folks are in there? Yea, yea me too. I don’t know if it’s for safety reasons or just to have a smidge more comfort  but even when we we’re not looking for each other, subconsciously we wonder how many chocolate chips are in the spot. 17 / 17",

        "text": "A video of a baby crawling competition is going viral as thousands of people are falling in love with a baby Usain Bolt who blew his competition out of their diapers. The tiny racers, competing during halftime at a basketball game in Louisiana, were vying for a shot at a prize package valued at 700 dollars along with the Baby Crawl Championship trophy – and bragging rights, of course. Although the race got off to a slow start, one adorable Black baby clearly shot out from the pack, leaving his mom and all of his competitors in the dust. With no one on his heels, he crawled across the court and made it through the finish line to meet his dad who was waiting with his celebratory sippy cup. Check out the exciting crawl-off here: During the post-race interview, the baby’s father said the sippy cup, one of his favorite things, likely motivated him to turn on the gas during the race. Mom, who looked like she has her hands full at home, added that he has one speed at home – fast. “He’s just a fast mover,” she said. The video, which has received nearly 60,000 views on YouTube, was flooded with comments from fans who think this baby has big things in his future. “College scouts are already coming to his crib...literally and figuratively!” wrote one commenter. Another commenter suggested that a Black baby winning would cause haters to pull the DEI card. “Ya’ll know someone about to blame DEI on that baby winning,” wrote someone. But in a separate post on TikTok, one user said the touching video is about more than cute babies crawling, but a life lesson about competition that will stay with him forever – always run through the line. “If you are an athlete, if you have ever competed, if you have ever run track, you know they say run through the line, not just to it,” she says. “This is beyond a life lesson that is found in a baby crawling competition.”",

        "text": "After you watch the movie musical in theaters, here’s how to catch it again from home. Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. We hope you’re still “holding space” for Wicked. With all the hype the smash-hit movie-musical has garnered over the last few months, let all of Oz be agreed: This is a film you’ll want to watch again and again. There’s no better time to celebrate than during Oscar season, as the film is nominated for 10 awards. Wicked’s Academy Award nods include Best Picture, Actress in a Leading Role (Cynthia Erivo), Actress in a Supporting Role (Ariana Grande), Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Sound, and Visual Effects. With that in mind, here’s what to know as you set out for the yellow brick road—ideally from the comfort of home. Wicked fans now have even more to look forward to on Oscars night. Grande and Erivo are confirmed to perform during the ceremony, with reports suggesting they may open the show with a number from the musical. While the song choices have yet to be revealed, their performance is expected to be one of the evening’s biggest moments. Wicked, a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, is an adaptation based on the acclaimed longstanding Broadway show and book by Gregory Maguire. The film is directed by Jon M. Chu, of In the Heights and Crazy Rich Asians fame, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, who originally composed the Broadway production. The story centers around Elphaba and Glinda (later known as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch, respectively), during their time at Shiz University. The two meet at the school, where they become roommates, rivals, and eventually, good friends. The film also features a large ensemble, including Jeff Goldblum as The Wizard, Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madam Morrible, Ethan Slater as Boq, Marissa Bode as Nessarose, and Bowen Yang as Pfannee, among others. Erivo and Grande have become close offscreen, too. Erivo, who was honored as one of ELLE’s 2024 Women in Hollywood, told ELLE, “I’ve gained a sister. At this point, we speak almost every day. Both of us were blown away by how connected we were immediately.” In an interview with Deadline, Grande shared similar sentiments, saying, “We both made the conscious decision when we met to take care of each other, and that’s what we have done in the realest of ways, every step. I always say this, but it’s one of the things that I think we’re most proud of. This whole thing.” And since this iteration of Wicked is just the first of two films, there will be a lot more of Glinda and Elphaba to look forward to when part two arrives next year. Because Wicked is distributed by Universal Pictures, which is part of NBCUniversal, the movie will be available to stream on Peacock starting March 21. The film became available to purchase or rent on digital platforms on Dec. 31, 2024. Audiences can access the film through participating digital retailers, including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Fandango at Home, Comcast Xfinity, Cox, and Microsoft Movies & TV. Purchasing the digital version also comes with exclusive bonus content, including deleted and extended scenes, a 40-minute journey through Oz celebrating the film’s on-screen magic, and a sing-along version of the movie for fans who want to belt out their favorite numbers.

        "title": "‘A litany of human suffering’ in Myanmar, warns UN rights chief | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail Myanmar is mired in one of the world’s worst human rights crises, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said on Friday, describing conditions there as “a litany of human suffering.” Addressing the Human Rights Council on Friday, he detailed the devastating toll of the ongoing conflict and economic collapse on civilians – many of whom have been displaced by the fighting. Earlier in the day the Council discussed the deteriorating situation in South Sudan, having heard a report from rights investigators serving on the Commission on Human Rights in the country. “Conflict, displacement and economic collapse have combined to cause pain and misery across Myanmar and civilians are paying a terrible price,” Mr. Türk said. The number killed in violence last year was the highest since the military coup in 2021. Over 1,800 civilians were killed in 2024, many in indiscriminate airstrikes and artillery shelling, with attacks on schools, places of worship and healthcare facilities having become routine. Mr. Türk condemned the military’s brutal tactics, including beheadings, burnings, mutilations, and the use of human shields. He also noted that nearly 2,000 people have died in custody since the coup, most due to summary executions and torture. Fighting between the junta forces and opposition armed groups has fuelled a humanitarian catastrophe, with more than 3.5 million people displaced and 15 million facing hunger – two million of whom are at risk of famine. In Rakhine state, clashes between the military and the Arakan Army have intensified, with thousands of civilians killed and Rohingya communities caught in the crossfire. Tens of thousands of Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in 2024, despite border restrictions. More than 8,000 fled by sea – an 80 per cent increase over 2023 – but at least 650 people, nearly half of them children, perished on the dangerous journey. Myanmar’s economic collapse has fuelled corruption and crime, with one global tracker ranking it the world’s biggest nexus of organized crime. It remains the top producer of opium and a major manufacturer of synthetic drugs. Furthermore, scam centres in eastern Myanmar have become notorious for human trafficking, where victims are coerced into cybercrime and subjected to torture, sexual violence, and forced labour. Mr. Türk also condemned the junta’s activation of military conscription laws, which have led to arbitrary arrests and forced recruitment, particularly targeting young men and women. Fear of conscription has driven many to flee the country, exposing them to trafficking and exploitation. “Given the humanitarian, political and economic impacts fuelling instability across the region, the international community must do more,” Mr. Türk underscored. He reiterated his call for an arms embargo, coupled with targeted sanctions – including on jet fuel and dual-use goods – to better protect the people of Myanmar. He also stressed the need for accountability, citing efforts at the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hold Myanmar’s military leaders accountable for atrocities. The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan presented its latest report to the Human Rights Council earlier in Geneva, detailing widespread violations, including extrajudicial killings, forced recruitment of children and systematic sexual violence. Despite South Sudan winning independence over a decade ago and repeated commitments to peace during years of civil war, the Commission found that the same patterns of abuses persist, often implicating high-ranking officials. “It is unconscionable that so many years after its independence, political leaders continue their violent contestations across the country and are abjectly failing the people of South Sudan,” said Yasmin Sooka, Chair of the Commission. The report described the situation in Tambura, where armed forces and militias inflicted extreme violence along ethnic lines in 2024, reigniting tensions from the 2021 conflict. Political elites at both local and national levels have actively fuelled this violence while remaining in power despite past crimes. The Commission also raised alarms over the “Green Book” law introduced in Warrap State in 2024, which authorizes extrajudicial executions for suspected cattle raiding and communal violence. South Sudan’s leaders agreed in September 2024 to extend the transitional political arrangements by two years, citing funding constraints. The Commission’s report noted that the government generated $3.5 billion in revenue between September 2022 and August 2024, while essential institutions – such as courts, schools, and hospitals – remain underfunded and civil servants go unpaid. “Financing essential services and rule of law institutions requires an end to the corruption. The theft of national wealth robs citizens of justice, education, and healthcare,” said Commissioner Carlos Castresana Fernández. “Without addressing this systemic looting, no peace agreement will ever translate into meaningful change,” he added. The Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan is an independent body mandated by the UN Human Rights Council. First established in March 2016, it has been renewed annually since. Its three Commissioners are not UN staff, they are not paid for their work and serve in an independent capacity. Four years after the military coup which plunged Myanmar into turmoil, the country is facing an unprecedented “polycrisis,” marked by economic collapse, intensifying conflict, complex climate hazards and deepening poverty, according to a new report by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). As South Sudan enters its extended transitional period this month, the UN’s top envoy to the country has warned that the clock is ticking to accomplish the commitments under a key 2018 peace accord, ahead of a new deadline set for February 2027.

        "title": "Human Rights Council: Türk calls out ‘dehumanizing’ narratives on Gaza | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail UN human rights chief Volker Türk on Thursday called for an end to the “abhorrent, dehumanizing narratives” that continue to hamper a positive outcome to the Middle East crisis. Mr. Türk – making his closing remarks during the session reporting on the Occupied Palestinian Territory at the Human Rights Council - said he was deeply troubled by the “dangerous manipulation of language” and disinformation that surrounds discussions over the Palestine-Israel conflict. “We need to make sure that we resist all efforts to spread fear or incite hatred, including abhorrent, dehumanizing narratives, whether they're insidious or explicit,” he said. “My Office will continue to work for justice for every victim and survivor by establishing and documenting the facts and standing firmly for accountability and the rule of law without exception.” The rights body then turned its focus to Eritrea on Thursday, where despite some long-awaited progress in improving the lives of ordinary Eritreans, the country’s authorities remain responsible for widespread alleged serious crimes including inside neighbouring Ethiopia, the forum heard. Ilze Brands Kehris, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, said that the Eritrean Defence Forces have continued to carry out grave crimes in Ethiopia’s Tigray region and elsewhere with total impunity. “Our Office (OHCHR) has credible information that Eritrean Defence Forces remain in Tigray and are committing violations, including abductions, rape, property looting, and arbitrary arrests,” she told the Council, before calling for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean soldiers. After a rapprochement between former enemies Eritrea and Ethiopia in 2018, Asmara sent troops to fight alongside Ethiopian federal troops against separatist rebels during the two-year conflict in Tigray, Amhara, Afar and Oromia. “In the current context, there is no likely prospect that the domestic judicial system will hold perpetrators accountable for the violations committed in the context of the Tigray conflict and in other cases,” the UN official told the Council, the world’s foremost human rights body. In a debate seeking to address the Council’s longstanding concerns about Eritrea’s human rights record, Ms. Brands Kehris acknowledged the efforts being made by the authorities in boosting essential health services to more than one million newborns, children and women last year with the help of the UN – and in ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December. However, “serious concerns remain” about Eritrea’s system of indefinite forced military conscription, the UN official continued. The practice has long been linked to abusive labour, torture and sexual violence which continues to compel young people to escape from the country, Ms. Brands-Kehris insisted. Furthermore, “the punishment of families of draft deserters remains very common – an inhumane practice, against which no steps have been taken”, she said. Echoing previous disturbing reports requested by the Human Rights on Eritrea’s rights record, the UN official said that detention without trial “remains the norm” – with many politicians, journalists, religious believers and draft deserters held incommunicado. There is no evidence that impunity will be tackled for well-documented past human rights violations, the senior UN official said. In response for Eritrea, Habtom Zerai Ghirmai, Chargé d'affaires a.i. to the UN in Geneva, denied the accusations, calling them exaggerated and misleading. Next in the spotlight was the plight of Sudan’s war-ravaged people who have been subjected to appalling crimes by all parties to the conflict - some possibly constituting war crimes and other atrocity crimes. Today, more than 600,000 Sudanese “are on the brink of starvation”, said rights chief Volker Türk. “Famine is reported to have taken hold in five areas, including Zamzam displacement camp in North Darfur, where the World Food Programme has just been forced to suspend its lifesaving operations due to intense fighting.” Another five areas could face famine in the next three months and 17 more are at risk, he said, calling on all Member States to push urgently for a ceasefire and to ease the suffering of the Sudanese people. Presenting his Office’s annual report on the situation in Sudan, Mr. Türk noted that the armed conflict between rival militaries that erupted in April 2023 following the breakdown in a transfer to civilian rule had generated “the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe”. The High Commissioner’s report details myriad violations and abuses committed in Sudan and underscores the need for accountability. “We are looking into the abyss. Humanitarian agencies warn that without action to end the war, deliver emergency aid, and get agriculture back on its feet, hundreds of thousands of people could die,” Mr. Türk insisted. He added that the spiralling situation in Sudan was “the result of grave and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and a culture of utter impunity”. “As the fighting has spread across the country, appalling levels of sexual violence have followed. More than half of reported rape incidents took the form of gang rape – an indication that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war,” Mr. Türk explained. “Sudan is a powder keg, on the verge of a further explosion into chaos,” said the UN’s top human rights official. Responding on behalf of Sudan, Minister of Justice Moawia Osman Mohamed Khair Mohamed Ahmed, rejected allegations that the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) were responsible for any of the rights violations detailed in the High Commissioner’s report. Sudanese civil society representative Hanaa Eltigani described multiple mass killings of civilians attributed to the Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries including in Geneina, their shelling of Zamzan displacement camp in North Darfur and other extreme rights abuses including gang rape and the forced recruitment of children, including South Sudanese refugees. In addition, the SAF “launched airstrikes and ground assaults, attacking Meneigo and Al-Igibesh villages in West Kordofan, bombing civilian areas in Nyala, South Darfur,” continued Ms Eltigani, Assistant Secretary-General of Youth Citizens Observers Network (YCON), insisting that while the suffering of her country’s people was “met with indifference, the flow of weapons [from abroad] continues unchecked”. The SAF also carried out executions in Al-Jazira, Ms. Eltigani maintained, “where victims were slaughtered or thrown alive into the Nile”. Turning to Afghanistan, the Council then heard that the de facto authorities’ oppression and persecution of women, girls and minorities has worsened, with no signs of improvement. “Some 23 million people, almost half the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, a situation drastically worsened by the pauses and cuts to international aid,” said Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan Richard Bennett. The independent rights expert, who is not a UN staff member, warned that left unchecked, the Taliban was likely to “intensify, expand and further entrench its rights-violating measures on the people of Afghanistan, in particular women and girls and likely religious and ethnic minorities”. “The lack of a strong, unified response from the international community has already emboldened the Taliban. We owe it to the people of Afghanistan to not embolden them still further through continued inaction.” The Taliban seized power in 2021 and since then have passed a raft of laws that have severely stifled the freedoms of women and girls. These include banning women and girls from most classrooms, singing or speaking outside their homes, as well as from travelling without a male guardian. Women were also barred from studying medicine in December. Windows in residential buildings have also been banned on the grounds that women could be seen through them. “Afghanistan is now the epicentre of an institutionalised system of gender-based discrimination, oppression, and domination which amounts to crimes against humanity, including the crime of gender persecution,” Mr. Bennett said, presenting his report. Mr. Bennett urged States to ensure that any normalization of diplomatic ties with the Taliban should be dependent on demonstrated improvements in human rights. “We must not allow history to repeat itself,” Mr. Bennett said. “Doing so will have catastrophic consequences in and beyond Afghanistan.” Independent rights experts are not UN staff, receive no salary for their work and are independent of any organisation or government. UN human rights chief Volker Türk issued a strong appeal on Wednesday for the fragile ceasefire in Gaza to hold, amid delays to talks between Hamas and Israel on extending the truce into the second phase.

        "title": "UN agencies condemn Thailand’s deportation of Uyghurs to China | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The UN human rights office (OHCHR) together with refugee agency, UNHCR, on Thursday strongly condemned Thailand’s deportation of 40 Uyghurs to China, calling it a serious violation of international law and the fundamental principle of non-refoulement. Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the forced return of the Uyghurs, who had been detained in Thailand for over 11 years, was deeply troubling. “This violates the principle of non-refoulement for which there is a complete prohibition in cases where there is a real risk of torture, ill-treatment, or other irreparable harm upon their return,” he said. Contained in Article 3 of the Convention against Torture, the principle prohibits returning individuals to a country where they face a risk of persecution, torture or ill-treatment. It is also referred to in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to seek asylum and of non-refoulement are also enshrined in Article 13 of Thailand’s Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act, and Article 16 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. The deported men were part of a larger group of Uyghurs who were detained in Thailand in March 2014, after leaving China, bound for Türkiye. For over a decade, they were held in immigration detention centres under poor conditions. According to OHCHR, five members of the group have died in custody, while eight others remain detained in Thailand. The UN rights chief also urged the Thai Government to halt any further deportations and ensure the protection of the remaining Uyghurs in detention. “The Thai authorities must ensure there are no further deportations and the remaining members of the group, including potential refugees and asylum-seekers, being held in Thailand are fully protected in accordance with their obligations under international law,” he added. UNHCR also condemned the deportation, saying it had repeatedly sought access to the detained Uyghurs and assurances they would not be forcibly returned – a request that has so far been denied. Ruvendrini Menikdiwela, Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, reiterated that it is a “clear violation” of the non-refoulement principle and the Government’s obligations under international law. “UNHCR calls on the Royal Thai Government to put an end to the forced return of individuals from Thailand,” she said. High Commissioner Türk also urged the Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of the deported Uyghurs. “It is now important for the Chinese authorities to disclose their whereabouts, and to ensure that they are treated in accordance with international human rights standards,” he said. A long-awaited report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) into what China refers to as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) has concluded that “serious human rights violations” against the Uyghur and “other predominantly Muslim communities” have been committed.

        "title": "Human Rights Council: Gaza ceasefire must hold, Türk insists | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail UN human rights chief Volker Türk issued a strong appeal on Wednesday for the fragile ceasefire in Gaza to hold, amid delays to talks between Hamas and Israel on extending the truce into the second phase. Addressing the Human Rights Council in Geneva on conditions inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Mr. Türk condemned the Hamas-led terror attacks on Israel that sparked the war in October 2023. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also said there was no justification for Israel’s devastating military operations in Gaza, which have left more than 48,000 Palestinians dead, according to local authorities. “At this tenuous moment the world must ask itself how to resolve this decades old conflict and stop the cycle of violence,” he said. “Any plans for a better future must deal with the past, so accountability and justice for violations are crucial.” The High Commissioner added that each phase of the ceasefire must be implemented “in good faith, and in full. All of us must do everything in our power to build on it.” He said it must be for the Palestinians themselves to determine their own future. According to news reports, the delayed release by Israel of Palestinian prisoners is expected to go ahead imminently, in exchange for the return of the bodies of four hostages. Summing up the “raft of human rights violations” inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory and lack of accountability, he said there had been “an unprecedented disregard” for basic principles of international humanitarian law by both sides since the outbreak of hostilities in October 2023. Mr. Türk maintained there were serious doubts over Israel’s capacity and will to deliver full accountability, notably in relation to unlawful killings in Gaza and the West Bank. With Hamas and other Palestinian militants who have taken and tortured hostages, fired indiscriminate projectiles into Israel – amounting to war crimes – there are concerns that they may also have committed serious breaches “including the intentional co-location of military objectives and Palestinian civilians.” “Any attempts at shaping a peaceful future where such horrors do not recur must ensure that perpetrators are held to account,” said the High Commissioner. Impunity when given free rein, harms not only those directly impacted but generations down the line, he contended. In an apparent response to the outlawing of the UN Palestine refugee relief agency, UNRWA, by Israel and the sanctions against the International Criminal Court by the US earlier this month, the UN rights chief said that “delegitimising and threatening international institutions that are there to serve people and uphold international law also harms us all.” He also said any attempt to annex Palestinian land or “forced transfer” of civilians must be resisted. “This is the moment for voices of reason to prevail; for solutions that will deliver justice and make space for compassion, healing and truth telling,” said Mr. Türk. Investigators tasked by the UN Human Rights Council to track alleged grave abuses of power by top Nicaraguan officials insisted on Wednesday that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) should prosecute what they called the systematic and systemic repression of the country’s people. The Group of Experts on Nicaragua - who act in an independent capacity and are not UN staff - have previously reported that the Government’s violations appear to constitute crimes against humanity of murder, imprisonment and torture - including rape. Their latest report will be presented later this week to the Council. The group maintains that President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, have created “an authoritarian State where no independent institutions remain, opposition voices are silenced and the population…faces persecution, forced exile, and economic retaliation”. It was in response to grave concerns about the severe repression of civil rights in Nicaragua that the international community decided in 2018 to establish an investigative body to report back to the Council. Despite repeated requests, the Nicaraguan authorities have not engaged with the independent investigators. “We call on States to hold Nicaragua accountable for its violations of the UN Convention on Torture and the UN Convention on Statelessness before the International Court of Justice…the international community cannot just bear witness. It needs to take concrete measures,” said Reed Brody, member of the Group of Experts. “No country in the world has used the arbitrary detention of nationality against political opponents at the same scale that Nicaragua has done; and this is a violation of its obligations under international law under the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,” Mr. Brody continued. According to the panel’s chair, Jan-Michael Simon, State machinery and the ruling Sandinista party “have virtually fused into a unified machine of repression with domestic and transnational impact.” This development - which has reduced the judicial, legislative and electoral powers “to mere bodies coordinated by the presidency” - has resulted in myriad deaths, “arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture, expulsion of nationals, arbitrary deprivation of nationality,” Mr. Simon insisted.

        "title": "UN rights chief decries substantial rise in death penalty executions | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail International efforts to eradicate the death penalty came into sharp focus at the Human Rights Council on Tuesday, where UN human rights chief Volker Türk decried a substantial increase in global executions in the last two years. “While a number of countries argue that it lies within their national sovereignty, from my perspective, it is incompatible with human dignity and the right to life,” the High Commissioner told Member States, during a discussion about the contribution of judiciaries to advancing human rights over the issue. The punishment had “no place” in the 21st century, Mr. Turk, continued, noting that “the top executing countries over recent years\" include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and the United States. Latest UN data indicates that in 2023, 1,153 executions took place in 16 countries, representing a 31 per cent increase from 2022 and the highest number in the past eight years. “That followed a 53 per cent increase in executions between 2021 and 2022,” the High Commissioner said, adding that the figures do not take into account China, “where there is a lack of transparent information and statistics on the death penalty. I call on the Chinese authorities to change this policy and join the trend towards abolition.” Although drug-related offences do not meet the “most serious crimes” justification for executions under international human rights law, they account for more than 40 per cent of death penalty executions – the highest number since 2016. “This proportion has also risen sharply over the past two years, and almost all of these executions took place in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Mr. Türk explained. In more positive developments and despite a global rise in executions, a growing number of countries are abolishing the practice – spurred by the Global South. Today, 113 countries have scrapped the death penalty completely. This includes Zimbabwe - where President Emmerson Mnangagwa approved a law ending executions at the end of 2024 – along with 26 other countries in Africa. Key to abolition are judicial reform and discretion in commuting executions to lesser punishments, the High Commissioner insisted. Malawi and Malaysia have implemented such reforms, leading to fewer death sentences, Mr. Türk continued, as he called for greater efforts globally to ensure fair trials and avoid wrongful convictions. He urged nations to move towards the complete abolition of the death penalty, advocate for moratoriums, and ensure that the death penalty is only used for the most serious crimes. Also addressing the Council, Zimbabwe Attorney General Virginia Mabiza explained that the death penalty had been introduced by colonial rulers in the 18th century, enduring beyond the country’s independence in 1980. She said that more than 56 per cent of the population wanted the death penalty to remain in the statute books when asked in 1999, while between 1980 and 2005, 105 convicted offenders were executed. “Since then, no other executions have been carried out in Zimbabwe, and this can be attributed to policy decisions coupled with judicial discretion against capital punishment,” the Attorney General told the Council. Ms. Mabiza noted that a wide range of offences had been formerly punishable by the death penalty including conspiracy and attempted robbery, but by 2013, only a murder conviction could lead to death for the convicted offender, in compliance with the UN General Assembly resolution on reducing the number of offences that attract the death penalty. And pointing to several instances where the Supreme Court in Harare determined that the death penalty constituted a violation of a prisoner’s human rights, Ms. Mabiza said that sentences were “often commuted death sentences to life imprisonment”.

        "title": "From suits to social justice: World’s top human rights forum turns stage over | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The iconic multi-hue ceilinged UN Human Rights Council chamber in Geneva got a generational make-over when it turned the venue over to young artists and changemakers in a lively celebration of social justice. Trading suits, ties and debates for DJ turntables, bright traditional Indigenous garb and ancient instruments, three performers – an anthropologist, an R&B singer and a genre-defying artist – showcased their music and messages at the Stand Up for Social Justice event to celebrate the World Day of Social Justice, marked annually on 20 February. It took place in front of hundreds of people in the emblematic Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room, where high-stakes diplomacy happens throughout the year. The world needs more diverse platforms like the UN “so that transculturality can exist”, said Brisa Flow, a Chilean-born Mapuche artist who got her first break in rap battles in Brazil, following her intense musical performance. “We need more empathy and to listen more to Indigenous Peoples in order to better understand how to take care of our territories that need care, not just in terms of water, food and land, but also our children and our elders,” said the São Paulo-based singer, rocking a green marble-printed manicure. “We need to be in spaces where everything we speak about is not just a utopia, where hope, which exists, can be heard and considered.” Ms. Flow joined French-speaking Geneva-born R&B revelation Ocevne (pronounced Océane) and anthropologist-cum-poet Idjahure Terena in delivering powerful music and personal messages inspired by social justice while helping to link local realities to issues of a global scale. Echoing the Day’s 2025 theme Strengthening a Just Transition for a Sustainable Future, the event was co-organised by UNRISD, an independent UN research institute focusing on development issues, and Antigel, a Geneva-based music festival designed to make culture more accessible. The messages from the young people on stage did just that, with electrifying performances and calls for change around the world. For Ocevne, 28, the message was about equality. “The simplest way I could define it is simply the right to equal opportunities,” she said. “No matter your background, where you come from, who you are, your gender, everything, we all have the right to that opportunity.” Climate justice was another recurring theme throughout the event, an issue highlighted by Mr. Terena, a doctoral student in social anthropology at the University of São Paulo and poet who spends much of his time defending the rights of his community and others. “There is no climate justice without social justice,” he told the audience. “We know that standing forests are the simplest and most efficient solution for fighting global warming.” The young researcher slammed the impact of mining companies and agribusinesses on his ancestral land that belongs to the Terena people of Brazil in the Pantanal region of Mato Grosso do Sul. “This is not just a territorial issue, but a matter of physical and cultural survival for our peoples and for humanity as indigenous lands represent the most important areas of biodiversity,” he said, inviting the audience to fight for a “common, diverse living world”. Indeed, “the future is going to be very hot,” said Ms. Flow, adding that “it is already very hot in Brazil, and this is urgent for us because without water, we cannot live, and without food, [we cannot] either.” Advocating for issues affecting indigenous communities, including the burning impacts of climate change on the natural resources of her home country, she said collectively not enough is getting done. “We need more communication and more exchanges. By exchanges, I mean listening, speaking, listening, speaking and thinking about new ways of living well so that we can keep heading into the future.” The event is the brainchild of UNRISD communications chief Karima Cherif, who wanted to bridge art and research through the initiative. She says her institute works with scholars from the global South to ensure that the voices and expertise of minorities are heard. “We’re giving voices to the marginalised and the youth,” explained Ms. Cherif, who sees art as a way to “translate what we do in a language that can touch hearts”. Thuy-San Dinh, who heads Antigel, echoed her vision and encouraged the young audience to pursue their goals, recalling when she co-created the annual event 15 years ago. “You have to believe in your ideas and never give up,” Ms. Dinh said. Melanie Rouquier, who created SHAP SHAP, a non-profit that fights global inequality and discrimination through cultural projects, told several activists in the room that each of their actions showed citizen engagement was not a lost cause. “To resist, we have to get together,” she said. For Aryan Yasin, a designer from Geneva who founded a cultural non-profit supporting disadvantaged youth, the show was an opportunity for cross-pollination and broadening his network by connecting with UN staff. The exceptional venue “is not a place where you would necessarily see young people”, he said. “But, that actually allows us to create an intergenerational connection, with people who are more experienced, more established,” he added. After the show, management student Ludivine said she was mesmerised by the experience. Putting on a concert with one of her favourite artists there to denounce inequalities “makes sense... because at the UN, people get together to talk about inequalities around the world.” After the event ended, doctoral students Beatrice and Thomas shared what the concept of social justice, which can seem quite abstract, meant to them. “It’s about recognising and taking differences into account while ensuring that everyone has the same access” to the same opportunities, said Beatrice, from Italy, who studies at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. “That may mean that some people will need more support, while others may not need as much, but have different needs.” Thomas offered a more societal vision of the idea. “For me, it’s something that is both individual and collective – something that must be built as a society. It is entirely dependent on the structures we have put in place, but it also relies on everything that is local.” Ahead of the concert, Tatiana Valovaya, Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva set the tone in her opening remarks in the Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room. “This room sees a lot of very important and challenging negotiations,” she told the audience. “But, today we open this room to everyone.” Geneva Mayor Christina Kitsos, whose term is guided by the motto “what connects us”, reminded the youthful audience of the UN’s fundamental role despite the worrying rise of “desire to undermine all the work [that has been done] around humanitarian aid and human rights”. “We need to be united, strong and truly hopeful and courageous to ensure that we stay the course, that we remain a beacon in this world in turmoil,” she said. In recent years, the term \"social justice\" has become a significant part of public discourse, often invoked in discussions about equality, human rights, and societal reforms. But what exactly does social justice mean, and why is it so important? Quality radio remains ever universal, popular and more reliable in an era of artificial intelligence (AI) and social media, including in Costa Rica, where unique programming raises awareness and promotes public participation on climate decision making in Latin America, the theme of this year’s World Radio Day, marked annually on 13 February.

        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail In recent years, the term \"social justice\" has become a significant part of public discourse, often invoked in discussions about equality, human rights, and societal reforms. But what exactly does social justice mean, and why is it so important? The United Nations supports the principle in multiple ways, from addressing economic inequality to access to education, healthcare, and the protection of human rights, with the aim of creating a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Social justice is for everyone, which is why the UN pays attention to the needs of particularly marginalized and vulnerable communities, such as refugees, indigenous peoples and those living with disabilities. Social justice encompasses a wide range of issues which are highlighted as part of World Day of Social Justice marked annually on 20 February. The UN definition of social justice is “an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations.” This can be interpreted as a world in which societies are based on the principles of equality and solidarity, understand and value human rights, and recognize the dignity of every human being. The five key principles of social justice are often defined as: Social justice is a cornerstone of the United Nations' mission to promote peace, security, and human rights worldwide and is enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an international blueprint for peace and prosperity. The Agenda is broken down into 17 ambitious Goals, which are due to be achieved in the next five years. Some progress has been made, particularly on the reduction of extreme poverty, and improved access to essential health services, but overall they are not on track. However, the Goals have been useful in providing UN Member States with clear, objective targets designed to improve the lives of their citizens. One of the primary ways the UN supports social justice is through the promotion of decent work and economic opportunities. The International Labour Organization (ILO), a specialized UN agency, plays a crucial role in this area. The ILO's Decent Work Agenda focuses on creating jobs, guaranteeing rights at work, extending social protection, and promoting social dialogue. By advocating for fair wages, safe working conditions, and the elimination of forced labour and child labour, the ILO helps ensure that workers worldwide are treated with dignity and respect. The promotion of decent work is one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda: Goal 8 (SDG 8) calls for the promotion of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Gender equality is another critical aspect of social justice that the UN actively promotes. It is a fundamental human right and is critical to a healthy society. UN Women, the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, works to eliminate discrimination against women and girls, empower women, and achieve gender equality, through initiatives such as the HeForShe campaign and the Spotlight Initiative. SDG 5 calls for the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls: UN-backed commitments have seen declines in some problem areas, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), but many women and girls continue to face barriers to their economic and social empowerment. Despite some recent progress in the percentage of students attaining a basic education, an estimated 300 million children and young people will still lack basic numeracy and literacy skills by 2030. Education is a powerful tool for reducing inequalities, reaching gender equality and achieving social justice, and the UN is committed to reaching SDG 4, which focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. The UN also supports educational and training programmes aim to build tolerance, understanding, and resilience among young people, helping them become advocates for social justice. The protection of human rights is at the heart of the UN's mission, and one of its greatest accomplishments is the drafting and adoption of the groundbreaking Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which paved the way for a comprehensive body of human rights law. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) works to promote and protect the human rights of all people, monitoring and reporting human rights violations, providing technical assistance to governments, and supporting the work of human rights defenders. The work of the OHCHR is crucial in ensuring that individuals can live free from discrimination, violence, and oppression. Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail",

        "title": "UN rights office warns of ‘dangerous tipping point’ as abuses surge in Sudan | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The UN human rights office (OHCHR) on Tuesday sounded the alarm over escalating rights abuses in Sudan, warning that impunity is driving violations as fighting spreads and more armed groups become involved. In a new report, UN investigators detailed multiple attacks on civilians, healthcare facilities, markets, and schools, as well as ethnically motivated summary executions. “The continued and deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as summary executions, sexual violence and other violations and abuses, underscore the utter failure by both parties to respect the rules and principles of international humanitarian and human rights law,” said Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. “Some of these acts may amount to war crimes. They must be investigated promptly and independently, with a view to bringing those responsible to justice,” he added. Among its key recommendations, the report called for expanding the arms embargo and the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to cover the whole of Sudan – not just the region of Darfur, where atrocities raged unchecked 20 years ago. More than 22 months of brutal fighting between Government forces and their former allied militia, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has left more than 30 million people across Sudan in need of assistance and protection. The fighting has precipitated the world’s worst displacement crisis, with over 12 million displaced from their homes, of whom 3.3 million have fled across the border. Food security and healthcare are also in freefall, with less than a quarter of Sudan’s health facilities functioning in areas worst hit by fighting. Nearly 25 million people are suffering from “acute” levels of hunger. The report highlighted the widespread use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, with 120 documented incidents affecting at least 203 victims. Cases are likely vastly underreported due to fear, stigma, and the collapse of medical and judicial institutions. All sides involved in the fighting have been responsible for violations, according to report, including widespread sexual violence. “The persistent use of sexual violence as a weapon of war in Sudan is deeply shocking,” High Commissioner Türk said. “Urgent steps must be taken by the parties to put an end to it, to hold those responsible to account and provide redress for survivors,” he stressed. The report also detailed widespread disappearances and a generalised crackdown on civic space, including killings of journalists and attacks on human rights defenders. At least 12 journalists were killed, two of them while in detention, and 31 were arbitrarily detained, including four women. In all, throughout 2024, OHCHR documented more than 4,200 civilian killings in the context of hostilities though the real number is likely much higher. Li Fung, the head of the OHCHR office in Sudan, described the dire situation in Sudan as a “dangerous tipping point”. Speaking to journalists at the UN Office at Geneva (UNOG) via video link from Port Sudan, she underscored the need for the international community to renew the focus on human rights. “[The international community] must take all necessary measures to protect civilians and prevent further violations and abuses. It remains urgent to ensure critical humanitarian assistance can reach those in need,” she said. “Together, we must stand with the people of Sudan.” The UN Secretary-General on Friday called on the international community to urgently scale up funding and diplomatic action to ease the suffering of millions of Sudanese facing hunger and displacement as rival militaries continue battling each other for control. More than one in two people in war-torn Sudan have too little to eat, famine “is taking hold” and sexual violence is rife, the UN’s top aid official said on Monday, as the global body launched an appeal for $6 billion to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the devastated country and beyond.

        "title": "UN rights office condemns continuing Israeli military operation in West Bank | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The UN human rights office, OHCHR, on Friday condemned the intensifying Israeli military operation in the northern West Bank, warning that nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced already amid an “alarming wave” of violence and destruction. Since the start of the offensive on 21 January, Israeli forces have killed at least 44 Palestinians, including five children and two women, in Jenin, Tulkarem and Tubas governorates, and four refugee camps in those areas, according to OHCHR. Many of those killed were unarmed and posed no imminent threat, said the UN rights office, calling the killings “part of an expanding pattern of Israel’s unlawful use of force in the West Bank where there are no active hostilities.” OHCHR also highlighted an unprecedented scale of mass displacement not seen in decades in the occupied West Bank. It cited reports from displaced residents of a pattern where they were led out of their homes by Israeli security forces and drones under the threat of violence. “They are then forced out of their towns with snipers positioned on rooftops around them and houses in their neighbourhoods used as posts by Israeli security forces,” the office said. Testimonies collected by OHCHR describe Israeli forces threatening residents who were told they would never be allowed to return. One woman, who fled barefoot carrying her two young children, said she was denied permission to retrieve heart medication for her baby. In Jenin refugee camp, bulldozed roads were photographed with new street signs reportedly now written in Hebrew. “In this regard, we reiterate that any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited and amounts to a crime under international law,” OHCHR stated. The office stressed that displaced Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes and called for immediate, transparent investigations into the killings. “Military commanders and other superiors may be held responsible for the crimes committed by their subordinates if they fail to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or punish unlawful killings,” it stated. OHCHR also reiterated Israel’s obligations under international law, including ending its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible and evacuating all West Bank settlements immediately. “In the meantime, as the occupying power, Israel must ensure the protection of Palestinians, the provision of basic services and needs, and the respect of Palestinians’ full range of human rights,” the office said. Meanwhile in Gaza, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) reported on Friday it had reached more than 860,000 men, women and children with food parcels, hot meals, bread and cash assistance since the start of the fragile ceasefire. UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at a regular news briefing in New York that over 19,000 metric tonnes of WFP food have entered Gaza. The agency has also distributed nutrition packs to some 85,000 people, including children under five, and pregnant and breastfeeding women, and provided more than 90,000 people with cash assistance in the past two weeks. “Efforts are also underway to establish more food distribution points, especially in North Gaza, to reduce travel distances, transport costs and protection risks for families,” Mr. Dujarric said. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) distributed 100,000 litres of fuel to hospitals in Gaza City on Friday, having delivered about 5,000 litres of fuel to Al Awda Hospital, in North Gaza governorate the day before. In southern Gaza, education partners in Rafah are preparing for the reopening of at least a dozen schools as displaced families return to their home areas, Mr. Dujarric said. “As you know, schools across the Strip had been used as shelters for Palestinians displaced during 15 months of hostilities. In Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, partners are providing cleaning materials to restart learning activities,” he added. Lifesaving aid continued to reach Gaza on Thursday while UN humanitarians warned that needs remain enormous after 15 months of constant Israeli bombardment. Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail",

        "title": "Belarus: Violations remain ‘widespread and systematic’, says independent expert group | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail A new report from UN Human Rights Council-mandated experts monitoring Belarus on Friday said that authorities have been committing widespread human rights violations, some amounting to crimes against humanity, as part of a systematic campaign to silence political opposition. The Group of Independent Experts on the Human Rights Situation in Belarus established in 2024, was tasked with investigating alleged violations since 2020 – when a disputed election saw President Alexander Lukashenko returned to power for a sixth term – and recommending steps toward accountability. The group was established last year for a renewable period of a year. Like all independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council, they serve on a voluntary basis, are not UN staff, receive no salary and are are independent of any government. In their latest findings presented to the Council, the experts documented arbitrary arrests, torture, sexual violence and the persecution of political opponents. The report details targeted abuses against LGBTQIA+ individuals, political activists and journalists, alongside sweeping legal changes aimed at eradicating all dissent. The violations, the experts concluded, are part of a widespread and systematic attack against civilians critical of the Government. The experts’ findings state that Belarusian authorities systematically detain critics on politically motivated charges, often subjecting them to repeated imprisonment under inhumane conditions. Arrests are frequently carried out using excessive force, together with threats and intimidation. Detainees report being beaten, subjected to electric shocks, and even threatened with rape – not only against themselves but also against their family members. The regime’s actions go beyond repression, with reasonable grounds to believe that some violations amount to “imprisonment and persecution on political grounds”, the report said. Widespread torture and ill-treatment are documented, particularly within temporary detention facilities and penal colonies. Men and women detained on political charges are routinely subjected to extreme conditions: some deprived of sleep, packed into overcrowded cells without basic hygiene and denied medical care. Many detainees describe being forced to make “repentance videos” after suffering physical and psychological abuse. The targeting of LGBTQIA+ individuals is particularly brutal, with security forces using homophobic slurs, beatings and sexual humiliation. In one instance, a transgender woman was severely beaten, threatened with rape and forced to confess to crimes she did not commit, the experts report. Hundreds of opposition figures, activists and journalists have been charged in absentia for alleged crimes such as “discrediting” the State. Their properties have been seized and their families in Belarus have faced harassment and intimidation. “The orchestrated campaign of violence and mistreatment was directed against Belarusians perceived as being critical of, or opposed to, the Government,” the experts noted. Conclusions show that such persecution extends beyond Belarus’s borders, leaving those in exile vulnerable and their families at home under pressure. The experts determined that Belarus’s actions amount to crimes against humanity, citing imprisonment, torture and persecution on political grounds as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians. They stressed that accountability is critical, emphasising that “identifying and prosecuting perpetrators of human rights violations and crimes against humanity is key to ending Belarus’s culture of impunity and integral for the victims to receive justice.” Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail",

        "title": "Bangladesh protests probe reveals top leaders led brutal repression | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The repression of mass protests in Bangladesh last year that toppled longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina left as many as 1,400 people dead in just 46 days – the vast majority shot by security forces, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Wednesday. In addition to those killed by the former government’s security and intelligence services alongside Awami League party associates, a report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) into the alleged crimes indicated that thousands were injured, including one youngster who was shot in the hand at point-blank range for throwing stones. “There are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Speaking in Geneva, Mr. Türk highlighted that some of the gravest violations detailed in the report may constitute international crimes that could be heard by the International Criminal Court (ICC), as Bangladesh is a State party to the Rome Statute which created the tribunal in The Hague. The ICC’s foundational Statute gives it jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression (following an amendment in 2010). Read our ICC explainer here. Alleged crimes in Bangladesh against the student-led protest included “hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrest and detention and torture, and ill treatment, including of children, as well as gender based violence”, the UN rights chief said. Furthermore, these violations “were carried out with the knowledge, coordination and direction of the former political leadership and senior security officials, with a specific goal of suppressing the protests and keep the former government’s grip on power”. According to the OHCHR report, as many as 12 to 13 per cent of those killed were children. Bangladesh Police also reported that 44 of its officers were killed between 1 July and 15 August 2024. Last summer’s protests that led Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down after 15 years in power were triggered by the High Court’s decision to reinstate a deeply unpopular quota system in public service jobs. But broader grievances were already entrenched, arising from “destructive and corrupt politics and governance” that spurred inequality, the UN human rights office report maintained. “I went to one of the hospitals in in Bangladesh when I visited, and I could talk to some of the survivors and some of them will be disabled for their lives. Especially young people…some of them were children,” Mr. Türk told journalists in Geneva, recounting his visit to Dhaka in September. “The brutal response was a calculated and well-coordinated strategy by the former Government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition,” insisted UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk. “The testimonies and evidence we gathered paint a disturbing picture of rampant State violence and targeted killings, that are amongst the most serious violations of human rights, and which may also constitute international crimes. Accountability and justice are essential for national healing and for the future of Bangladesh,” he added. The UN human rights office probe mission started work in Bangladesh on 16 of September 2024 with a team that included a forensic physician, a weapons expert, a gender expert and an open-source analyst. The investigators visited protest hotspots including universities and hospitals. Their work was complemented by more than 900 witness testimonies.  Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail",

        "title": "Short-range drones: The deadliest threat to civilians in Ukraine | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail In January 2025, short-range drones caused more casualties than any other weapon in Ukraine, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said in a new report released on Tuesday. With increasing reports of these drones striking civilians in cars, on buses and on public streets, UN monitors have raised serious concerns about potential violations of international humanitarian law. According to HRMMU’s latest monthly update on the protection of civilians, at least 139 were killed and 738 injured in Ukraine last month. Attacks using short-range drones accounted for almost 30 per cent of these incidents. “Short-range drones now pose one of the deadliest threats to civilians in frontline areas,” said Danielle Bell, Head of HRMMU. The mission reports that 95 per cent of casualties from short-range drones in January occurred in territory controlled by Ukraine, with the remaining five per cent in areas occupied by Russia. Many of the attacks involved first-person-view drones, that is, drones equipped with real time cameras, allowing operators to identify and track their targets with precision. While such technology should, in theory, enable drone operators to distinguish between military and civilian targets, the UN’s findings suggest otherwise. “Our data shows a clear and disturbing pattern of short-range drones being used in ways that put civilians at grave risk,” Ms. Bell noted. The new year brought no respite in frontline regions but rather an escalation and even expansion of the fighting. Casualties due to short-range drones were responsible for 70 per cent of civilian deaths in the Kherson region, which suffered the highest number of casualties. One of the most shocking incidents took place on 6 January, when a drone targeted a public transit bus in Kherson City during rush hour. The attack killed a man and a woman and injured eight others. HRMMU also recorded an increase in drone-related casualties in other frontline regions, including Kharkiv, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Survivors have described the moments leading up to these attacks with harrowing detail. A civilian from Mykolaiv recounted how a small drone circled above his head before diving directly at him while he was working in his home’s garden. “I realised that I did not have time to hide. I dropped to the ground and covered my head with my hands,” he told HRMMU. “The blast wave tore off all my clothes. I somehow instinctively tried to protect my eyes. This saved my eyesight, because after the drone explosion, the backs of my palms were covered with small metal fragments, which surgeons later removed. My wedding ring was so pressed into my finger that they had to saw it off to remove it from my finger,” he continued. HRMMU’s data shows a sharp increase in civilian casualties from short-range drones throughout 2024, with a particularly alarming spike in the last six months. “The on-board cameras should allow operators to distinguish with a higher degree of certainty between civilians and military objectives”, Ms. Bell said, “yet civilians continue to be killed in alarming numbers”. As Ukraine’s conflict continues, UN monitors have reiterated calls for all parties to take immediate measures to safeguard civilians, in line with international humanitarian principles. Another scourge facing civilians across Ukraine is the vast amount of explosive remnants of war which are accumulating. Here's what the UN is doing to help save farms from being no-go zones: The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has expressed deep alarm over relentless attacks on populated areas in Ukraine and their devastating impact on children. The recent holiday and New Year season brought no respite in Ukraine, but rather an escalation and even expansion of the fighting, consistent with developments in 2024, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs said in a briefing to the Security Council on Thursday.

        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The UN human rights office, OHCHR, called on Monday for Israel and Hamas to ensure that all people they are holding are treated humanely. “Images of emaciated Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees released as part of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement have been deeply distressing,” Spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement. He added that the pictures of Israeli hostages released this past weekend show signs of ill-treatment and severe malnourishment, reflecting the dire conditions they were subjected to in Gaza. “We are also deeply concerned by the public parading of hostages released by Hamas in Gaza, including statements apparently made under duress during release,” continued Mr. Al-Kheetan. Meanwhile, Palestinians released from Israeli detention have revealed similar treatment under severe conditions, described by OHCHR as distressing and cause for serious concern. “Israel and Hamas must ensure humane treatment, including freedom from any form of torture or abuse, for all those held under their power,” declared Mr. Al-Kheetan. The spokesperson reminded all parties to the conflict that torture and other forms of ill-treatment of protected persons are war crimes. and those found guilty must receive sentences commensurate to the severity of their conduct. “We reiterate that the taking of hostages is a war crime,” he said. “Hamas must immediately and unconditionally release all hostages, and Israel must immediately and unconditionally release all those arbitrarily detained.” As the Israeli military completed its withdrawal at the weekend from a key security corridor in Gaza that had cut the enclave in two, UN humanitarians issued a fresh appeal for an end to all aid restrictions which continue to prevent the delivery of lifesaving relief.

        "title": "Sudan: Civilian death toll triples in one week amid escalating hostilities | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The civilian death toll in Sudan has surged dramatically, with at least 275 people killed between 31 January and 5 February, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, reported on Friday. This figure represents a threefold increase from the previous week, when at least 89 civilians lost their lives amid the ongoing hostilities.The crisis is compounded by intensifying violence in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, where a humanitarian catastrophe looms, according to the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami. This week, the conflict has intensified as artillery shelling, airstrikes and aerial drone attacks continue to devastate populated areas, including Khartoum, North and South Darfur as well as North and South Kordofan. South Kordofan’s capital, Kadugli, has seen at least 80 civilian casualties – with reports of women and children being used as human shields. Meanwhile, the threat of further violence in Blue Nile is growing, with reports of mass mobilisation for conflict. “The sharp increase in civilian deaths underscores the dire risks civilians face amid the continued failure by the parties to the conflict and their allies to protect civilians,” OHCHR spokesperson Seif Magango said in a statement. Beyond the rising death toll, humanitarian volunteers are also under threat. Local partners report that some aid workers have been erroneously accused of collaborating with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), making them targets of intimidation and violence. One individual has already received a death threat and since the conflict erupted in April 2023, at least 57 members of a local volunteer network have been killed. The situation is further worsened by critical shortages of medical supplies and growing food insecurity, particularly in South Kordofan, where malnutrition rates are spiking. OHCHR has urged all parties involved in the conflict to end indiscriminate attacks and targeted violence against civilians. “The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces - and their allied movements and militias - must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders,” Mr. Magango emphasised.

        "title": "DR Congo: Rights chief warns crisis could worsen, without international action | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail UN human rights chief Volker Türk on Friday expressed profound concerns at the ongoing violent escalation in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) caused by the ongoing Rwanda-backed M23 offensive. “If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come, for the people of the eastern DRC, but also beyond the country’s borders,” he told a Special Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Since 26 January, nearly 3,000 people have been killed and 2,880 injured in attacks by the M23 and their allies “with heavy weapons used in populated areas, and intense fighting against the armed forces of the DRC and their allies”, the High Commissioner said, as UN Member States weighed setting up a fact-finding mission to investigate extreme rights violations still being committed in the DRC provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. Hostilities have continued unabated in this mineral-rich region that has been unstable for decades amid a proliferation of armed groups, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Fighting escalated in late January when majority-Tutsi M23 fighters seized control of parts of North Kivu, including areas near Goma, and advanced towards South Kivu and the eastern DRC’s second city of Bukavu. A draft resolution circulated before the Special Session – the 37th since the Council was created in 2006 - also condemned Rwanda’s military support of the M23 armed group and called for both Rwanda and M23 to halt their advance and to allow lifesaving humanitarian access immediately. Addressing the emergency session, Mr. Türk noted that two hospitals in Goma had been bombed on 27 January, killing and injuring multiple patients, including women and children. In a mass prison break at Muzenze Prison in Goma on the same day, at least 165 female inmates were reportedly raped and most were later killed in a fire under suspicious circumstances, he said, citing the authorities. “I am horrified by the spread of sexual violence, which has been an appalling feature of this conflict for a long time. This is likely to worsen in the current circumstances,” the UN rights chief continued, adding that UN staff were now verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang rape and sexual slavery in eastern DRC’s conflict zones. Echoing those concerns, Bintou Keita, Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the DRC and chief of UN peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) told the Council that dead bodies still lie in the streets of Goma, which M23 fighters now control. The situation is “catastrophic”, she continued. “While I am speaking, youth are being subjected to forced recruitments and human rights defenders, civil society actors and journalists have also become a major population at risk. MONUSCO continues to receive requests for individual protection from them as well as from judicial authorities under threat and at risk of reprisals from M23 in areas under its control.” She issued a stark warning on the health risks linked to ongoing fighting, “especially the resurgence of cholera and the high risk of mpox, the sudden interruption of children's schooling, and the rise of conflict-related sexual violence and gender-based violence”. According to latest reports, medical personnel face electricity cuts and lack fuel for their generators for basic services, including morgues, Ms. Keita continued. “I again call on international community to advocate for humanitarian assistance to reach Goma immediately.” In response to the ongoing crisis, DRC’s Minister of Communications and Media, Patrick Muyaya Katembwe, spoke out against the continued logistical, military and financial support of countries including Rwanda “to armed groups operating on our territory”. The minister maintained that Rwanda's support for the M23 had fuelled the violence in eastern DRC “for more than 30 years, exacerbating the war for reasons linked to the exploitation of the strategic mining resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo”. Dismissing that claim, Ambassador James Ngango of Rwanda to the UN in Geneva, insisted that a large-scale attack against Rwanda was “imminent”. He accused the “Kinshasa-backed coalition” of stockpiling a large number of weapons and military equipment near Rwanda’s border, mostly in or around Goma airport. “These weapons include rockets, kamikaze drones, heavy artillery guns capable of shooting precisely within the Rwandan territory. The weapons were not turned at the theatre of operations against the M23, rather they were pointed directly at Rwanda,” he said. Highlighting the need for international efforts to end the long-running conflict, Mr. Türk called for greater understanding of the political and economic background. “The population in the eastern DRC is suffering terribly, while many of the products we consume or use, such as mobile phones, are created using minerals from the east of the country. We are all implicated.” In response to the ongoing emergency, the Human Rights Council’s 47 Members  adopted a resolution establishing a fact-finding mission into abuses - staffed by the UN human rights office, OHCHR – to start work as quickly as possible. A commission of inquiry will take over the fact-finding mission's work once its commissioners are appointed, OHCHR said at the outcome of the Special Session. Now is the time to end the crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the UN Secretary-General said on Thursday in a briefing to journalists in New York. The current phase of fighting erupted in late January in the mineral-rich eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between government forces and the armed M23 group.

        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail Widespread pillaging and the destruction of property in Syria by all parties to the conflict have largely gone unpunished and likely amount to war crimes, top independent rights investigators reporting to the Human Rights Council maintained on Thursday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria’s latest report follows the lightning operation led by mainly Hayat-Tahrir al-Sham fighters that toppled President Bashar al-Assad last December, ending the 13-year war that decimated the country and destabilised the entire region. The violence is believed to have killed hundreds of thousands of Syrians and uprooted 15 million, the report’s authors said. They noted that various armed groups – including former government troops and opposition fighters – carried out widescale damage to and pillaged Syrian property, particularly in areas that changed hands repeatedly during the fighting. The Assad regime’s security forces targeted those perceived as political opponents, including demonstrators, activists, deserters and defectors, their families and communities, the report’s authors continued. Vast areas of land where refugees and internally displaced people had relocated to were also pillaged and ransacked to the point of rendering entire neighbourhoods uninhabitable. Forces stole household items, furniture and valuables, which they would sometimes sell at markets including some created specifically for this purpose. They also dismantled roofs, doors, windows, iron rods, electrical wires and plumbing fixtures. “Systematic pillage was coordinated by members of the former Syrian army, such as the Fourth Division, and affiliated security forces and militias, who concluded business agreements with private contractors or merchants interested in acquiring looted items, including raw materials,” the Commissioners explained. The wrongdoings could “amount to war crimes” if “carried out for private or personal gain”, they added. To date, accountability for these crimes has not happened and the overwhelming majority of perpetrators have escaped any accountability. “The impunity for the war crime of pillage has been near total in Syria” except for a few convictions in areas held by the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). “The only known convictions that relate to pillage or property offenses concern female former members of ISIL [or Da’esh, the terrorist group]”, the report said, adding that none of the forces perpetrating pillage on a massive scale had been prosecuted. Among their recommendations, the Commissioners urged renewed efforts to protect housing, land and property rights as paramount to the country’s efforts to rebuild after a decade of crippling conflict. If the violations remain unaddressed, grievances and social tensions will be exacerbated, fuelling cycles of violence and displacement, the commission warned. The investigators write that following the fall of the regime, on 8 December, the “devastating patterns” of pillage “must not be repeated”. The report urges all military commanders and newly empowered leaders to prevent and punish any instances where property is stolen that was left behind by those newly displaced. The Commissioners representing the top rights panel are appointed and mandated by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council. They are not UN staff, do not draw a salary, and serve in their individual capacity, independent of the UN Secretariat. The United Nations on Tuesday condemned a deadly car bomb attack in the Syrian city of Manbij that killed 20 people, mostly women, and left many others critically injured. The UN Special Envoy for Syria said on Monday that Syrians across the political spectrum share a deep conviction that the country’s political transition must succeed.

        "title": "Human rights situation in Haiti remains ‘very alarming’, UN report finds | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail Gang violence in Haiti continues to have a devastating impact on the population, according to a new report from the UN office in the country (BINUH) on human rights violations recorded during the last quarter of 2024. Released on Tuesday, the new report highlights that at least 5,626 people have been killed and more than 2,213 injured in the past year, due to the armed gangs who control much of the capital and the country at large. These figures reflect a sharp increase of over 1,000 fatalities compared to 2023, underscoring the unrelenting brutality gripping the nation. UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric highlighted the findings in Tuesday’s press briefing in New York, pointing to a severe deterioration in Haiti’s security landscape. According to BINUH, the last quarter of 2024 saw an alarming rise in deadly gang-related attacks. At least 1,732 people were killed and 411 injured due to violence by armed groups, self-defence units and law enforcement operations. The report highlights three large-scale massacres that resulted in over 300 deaths, with the most severe attack occurring in the Wharf Jérémie neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince. Between 6 and 11 December, at least 207 people were slaughtered by a gang led by Monel Felix, known as “Micanor,” who accused the mainly elderly victims of practicing voodoo and being responsible for the death of his child. The armed gang executed people in their homes and a local place of worship before burning or dismembering bodies to conceal evidence. No law enforcement intervention was reported during the five-day attack. Similar atrocities took place in Pont Sondé and Petite Rivière de l’Artibonite, where coordinated gang offensives left at least 170 people dead in early December. The murders sparked reprisals by self-defence groups, further intensifying the violence Haiti’s security forces have also been implicated in grave human rights violations. The report documents more than 250 executions carried out by police in 2024, with two children among the victims. Many individuals were executed after being detained, while others - including street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers - were shot for failing to provide identification. The Public Prosecutor of Miragoâne was also cited for six extrajudicial executions, bringing the total killings by prosecutors to 42 in 2024. Despite calls for accountability, investigations into police abuses remain largely stalled. BINUH noted that no officers have undergone vetting since June 2023, reflecting a deep-seated lack of supervision. Haiti has also experienced a 150 per cent surge in kidnappings with gangs increasingly targeting children. The report raised alarm over widespread sexual violence, with at least 94 cases of rape and sexual exploitation documented in the last quarter alone. Women and girls remain particularly vulnerable in gang-controlled areas, where they are subjected to systemic abuse. Additionally, child trafficking and forced recruitment by armed groups continue to rise. UNICEF has warned of a 70 per cent increase in child soldiers, with boys as young as 12 being used for kidnappings, armed confrontations and extortion. Despite the scale of the crisis, Haiti’s judicial system remains paralysed. While some efforts were made in late 2024 - including appointments to key judicial posts - progress on high-profile massacres and corruption cases remains slow. Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé ordered investigations into the Pont Sondé and Wharf Jérémie massacres, yet no arrests or judicial actions had been taken by the end of the year. The High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk emphasised the critical need to restore the rule of law and called on the international community to ensure the full deployment of the Multinational Security Support mission (MSS). The UN has also urged regional governments to intensify inspections of arms shipments destined for Haiti, in line with Security Council resolutions. With over one million people displaced and a humanitarian catastrophe continue to unfold, urgent international intervention is seen as vital to stabilising the country. Migrants who have been deported from the Dominican Republic to Haiti – the two Caribbean nations that share the island of Hispaniola – have been talking to the UN about the challenges of returning to a crisis-ridden country they barely know. Violent clashes this week between security forces and armed groups on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince have led to another wave of displacement, according to the UN aid coordination office (OCHA).

        "title": "Sudan: UN rights chief ‘alarmed’ by summary executions, attacks on civilians | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has voiced deep alarm over reports of summary executions of civilians allegedly carried out by fighters and militias allied with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the city of Khartoum North, calling for an immediate halt to the killings. Government forces and a rival military – the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have been battling for control of the country since April 2023 in what Mr. Türk called a “senseless war”, which has recently taken an “even more dangerous turn for civilians” as reports of people brutally killed in ethnically targeted attacks mount. In a statement released on Friday, the High Commissioner reported that at least 18 civilians, including one woman, were killed in seven separate incidents after SAF forces regained control of the area around Khartoum North – Sudan’s third largest city - on 25 January, according to verified information from the rights chief’s office (OHCHR). Many of the victims were originally from the Darfur and Kordofan regions, raising concerns about targeted violence. “These reports of summary executions, following similar incidents earlier this month in Al Jazirah State, are deeply disturbing,” said Mr. Türk. “Such killings must not become normalised. Deliberately taking the life of a civilian or anyone not or no longer directly taking part in hostilities is a war crime,” he emphasised. OHCHR is also investigating disturbing video footage that surfaced on 30 January, in which men in SAF uniforms and members of the Al Baraa Bin Malik Brigade in Khartoum North appear to read out a list of alleged RSF collaborators, saying \"Zaili,\" which is Arabic for “killed”, after each name. Meanwhile, further threats of violence have emerged, with a video showing a member of the same brigade threatening to slaughter residents of El Hadj Yusif in East Nile, another area of Khartoum North mainly inhabited by people from Darfur and Kordofan. Mr. Türk urged all parties to the conflict to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian and human rights law. “Independent investigations must be held into these incidents in line with relevant international standards,” he underscored. Meanwhile, attacks on civilians by the RSF continue across Sudan. In El Fasher, North Darfur, the Abu Shouk camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) was shelled again on 29 January, killing nine civilians, including two women and a child, and injuring at least 12 others. Hospitals have also been targeted. On 24 January, a drone attack attributed to the RSF killed at least 67 people and injured 19 at Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital in El Fasher. The attack severely damaged the emergency unit, rendering it inoperable. The hospital - the only facility providing specialised maternal care in the area - has now been struck twice this month and was shelled at least 13 times in 2024. “Deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects are abhorrent,” Mr. Türk stated. “They must end immediately and so must incitement to violence against civilians,” he emphasised. As violence escalates, Mr. Türk reiterated the urgent need for all parties to uphold their legal obligations and ensure the protection of civilians. Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail",

        "title": "World News in Brief: Deadly virus outbreak in Uganda, $500 million human rights appeal, Thailand’s lèse-majesté laws in spotlight | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday confirmed an outbreak of Sudan virus disease in Uganda, which is part of the Ebola virus family. Health authorities in Kampala confirmed that one patient has died – a nurse who had sought treatment at various other medical facilities after developing fever-like symptoms. In response to the outbreak of the often deadly and infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids and tissue, WHO is mobilising efforts to support national health authorities in swiftly containing and ending the outbreak. Senior public health experts and staff from WHO's country office are being deployed to support key outbreak response measures. Additionally, WHO has allocated $1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to accelerate early action. Medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, are being readied for delivery from WHO's Emergency Response Hub in Nairobi. Although there are no licensed vaccines for Sudan virus disease, WHO is coordinating with developers to deploy candidate vaccines once all necessary approvals are obtained. Regarding the deceased man, no other health workers or patients have shown symptoms, said WHO. A total of 45 contacts, including health workers and family members are under close monitoring. The identification of the case in a densely populated urban area necessitates a rapid and intense response, the agency stressed. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, welcomed the prompt outbreak declaration saying the agency was supporting the Government and partners “to scale up measures to quickly identify cases, isolate and provide care, curb the spread of the virus, and protect the population. “Uganda’s robust expertise in responding to public health emergencies will be crucial in ending this outbreak effectively.\" There have been eight previous outbreaks of Sudan Ebola Virus Disease, with five in Uganda and three in Sudan. Uganda last reported an outbreak in 2022. The UN human rights chief on Thursday launched a $500 million funding appeal for 2025 to address a multitude of crises threatening to reverse decades of progress. The appeal aims to support critical human rights efforts, including rights mainstreaming, advisory services and technical cooperation, alongside field offices of the UN human rights office, OHCHR. It will also boost special trust funds, such as those supporting victims of torture, Indigenous Peoples, or those impacted by slavery. Launching the appeal in Geneva, UN rights chief Volker Türk, reiterated the importance of these efforts: “During conflicts and in peacetime; in developing countries and advanced economies; from historic grievances to emerging risks – my Office is holding the line for humanity. “Human rights are a low-cost, high-impact investment to mobilize people for peace, security, and sustainable development; and to build social cohesion based on the contributions of every individual,” he added. The appeal is in addition to the OHCHR’s regular budget of $238.5 million as part of UN’s overall budget that was approved in late December 2024. That amount is not sufficient to cover all of its mandated work and the requests for assistance it receives. Mr. Türk underscored the need to ensure OHCHR has sufficient resources to carry out its vital work. “I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in 2025, people who should otherwise be free, may remain in prison,” he said. “Women and girls may lose out on opportunities, ignored by the world. Violations and abuses may go undocumented, leading to a lack of accountability and increased impunity. And human rights defenders may lose the little protection they have,” he warned. A group of independent UN human rights experts condemned Thailand’s continued use of lèse-majesté laws to imprison activists and human rights defenders, calling for the repeal or significant revision of the country’s criminal code. In a news release on Thursday, the experts – who are mandated and appointed by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council – warned that Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code, which punishes criticism of the monarchy with up to 15 years in prison, violates international human rights standards. “Under international law, individuals have the right to criticise public officials, including a King, and to advocate peacefully for the reform of any public institution, including the monarchy,” the experts said. They described the law as “harsh and vague”, highlighting that it grants excessive discretion to authorities and courts, leading to widespread misuse. Since 2020, more than 270 people have been prosecuted under Article 112, many receiving lengthy consecutive sentences. “Lèse-majesté laws have no place in a democratic country,” the experts said, warning that their use stifles political expression and silences activists, journalists, and opposition members. They urged the Thai Government to amend the country’s criminal code to align with international human rights laws and called for an immediate moratorium on prosecutions and imprisonments under lèse-majesté laws. When the plague, cholera and yellow fever rippled deadly waves across a newly industrialised and interconnected world in the mid-19th century, taking a global approach to health became an imperative. Doctors, scientists, presidents and prime ministers urgently convened the International Sanitary Conference in Paris in 1851, a precursor to what is now the largest of its kind: the World Health Organization, known as WHO.

        "title": "Syria: Rights probe reveals systematic torture and detention of Assad regime | UN News",
        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail A report from UN human rights investigators for Syria released on Monday has laid bare the systematic use of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances by the deposed Assad regime. The findings from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria detail crimes against humanity and war crimes that left a legacy of trauma for countless Syrians, representing some of the worst violations of international law committed during more than a decade of brutal conflict. “We stand at a critical juncture. The caretaker government and future Syrian authorities can now ensure these crimes are never repeated,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chair of the Commission. “We hope our findings from almost 14 years of investigations will help end impunity for these patterns of abuse.” The report, titled Web of Agony: Arbitrary Detention, Torture and Ill-Treatment in the Syrian Arab Republic, draws on over 2,000 testimonies, including accounts from more than 550 survivors of torture. The fall of the Assad regime last month and subsequent release of prisoners have been pivotal for many Syrians, but for tens of thousands of families, the agony persists. The discovery of mass graves has deepened fears for those whose loved ones remain missing. In December and January, Commission teams visited several grave sites and former detention facilities, including Sednaya Military Prison and branches of the former intelligence services in Damascus. While significant amounts of evidence and documentation had been destroyed, some materials were preserved, offering a glimmer of hope for families seeking answers. “For Syrians who did not find their loved ones among the freed, this evidence, alongside testimonies of freed detainees, may be their best hope to uncover the truth about missing relatives,\" said Commissioner Lynn Welchman. “We commend the new authorities for their commitment to protecting mass graves and evidence and encourage further efforts, with the support of relevant Syrian civil society and international actors.” The report outlines harrowing accounts of abuse, including severe beatings, electric shocks, rape, mutilation and prolonged psychological and physical torture. Survivors and witnesses described dire prison conditions including malnutrition, disease and injuries left untreated. Some detainees were executed, while others succumbed to their injuries in overcrowded, unsanitary cells. Having gained access to Syria for the first time since 2011, the Commission plans to expand its investigations with unprecedented access to sites and survivors who no longer fear reprisals. The report emphasises the importance of safeguarding evidence and archives, calling for coordinated efforts with Syrian civil society and international actors. “Cases brought before national courts outside Syria, relying on the principle of universal jurisdiction, have led to important convictions of mid- and lower-level perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity,” said Commissioner Hanny Megally. “We now hope to see credible national justice initiatives, in which survivors and families can play a central role. We stand ready to assist alongside Syrian human rights and family associations and our UN partners.” The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established in August 2011 by the UN Human Rights Council, with a mandate to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011. The Council also tasked the Commission with establishing the facts and circumstances surrounding alleged crimes and identifying those responsible, in an effort to hold them accountable. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi concluded a visit to Syria on Monday, calling for urgent international support to aid those returning home. Since September, over 500,000 refugees have made the journey, but they face overwhelming challenges: destroyed homes, shattered infrastructure and widespread poverty, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. The agency is working with Syrian caretaker authorities and neighbouring countries to support returns, provide legal aid, transportation and cash assistance. Families returning to cities like Aleppo described harsh realities, such as limited access to electricity and water, emphasising the urgent need for investment in healthcare, education and employment. “This is a pivotal moment,” Mr. Grandi said. “The world must act now to support Syria’s recovery. Cooperation between neighbouring countries, donors and the Syrian caretaker authorities is essential to bring much-needed peace and stability to Syria and the entire region.” UNHCR estimates that 27 per cent of Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, plan to return home within the next year – an increase from less than two per cent before the collapse of the regime. The UN Special Envoy for Syria on Wednesday emphasised the strong international consensus that is emerging in support of the country’s political transition since the fall of the Assad regime last month.

        "text": "Facebook\nTwitter\nPrint\nEmail On this day, 80 years ago, some 7,000 prisoners who had been left to starve in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camps were liberated by allied soldiers. Marking Holocaust Remembrance Day on Monday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said the essence of commemorations was to acknowledge the past but they “must also examine the present and look to the future”. Underlying the rise of hateful rhetoric, with rising antisemitism on the streets and online, the UN rights chief said that “discrimination and dehumanisation are winning out over solidarity and compassion; diversity is viewed as a threat rather than something to be treasured; and many leaders are undermining and weakening the rule of law”. Reminding us that everyone has a “duty to stand against intolerance”, Mr. Türk shared his fear the world is “sleepwalking into a grim future where human rights and dignity are denied, stripped away or forgotten”. Listen back to the story of Eva Lavi, the youngest survivor to be saved from the Nazis by the German industrialist Oskar Schindler: In a powerful video-message, Mr. Türk urged the global community to remain vigilant in the face of rising intolerance and discrimination. The call comes as a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and the lessons it teaches. Echoing the words of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who famously said, “silence encourages the tormentor,” he emphasized the importance of speaking out against all forms of hatred, particularly antisemitism. \"We must condemn it in all its forms, alongside bigotry, intolerance, and hatred,\" Mr. Türk advocated, urging people to take action. The central theme of this year’s Holocaust Remembrance is the ongoing battle for dignity and human rights. In a call to expose disinformation and resist efforts to foster division, hatred and fear, Mr. Türk said that diversity must be celebrated, and Holocaust stories must be retold as a crucial safeguard against prejudice and racism. “Holocaust education remains one of the best vaccines against dehumanization,” he added, calling for a just and dignified future for all. On Monday, the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, is due to deliver remarks to the General Assembly, at the annual ceremony of remembrance at UN Headquarters. The ceremony is scheduled to start at 11 AM New York time and will honour the victims, also paying tribute to the dwindling band of survivors, some of whom will share their testimonies along with invited speakers. You can follow live here. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Wednesday described antisemitism as an ongoing plague and “scourge on our collective humanity” which has resulted in damaging consequences for communities worldwide. UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday called on world leaders to rely on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as a roadmap to not only uphold human rights but also prevent wars, combat hatred, rebuild trust and build a sustainable future for all.

        "title": "Crypto Gears Up for New Jersey, New York Governor Election",
        "text": "© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED An industry increasingly associated with Trumpism is moving into the spotlight in Democratic gubernatorial races in New Jersey and New York. Mayor Steve Fulop of Jersey City, New Jersey, was running for governor when he announced that he would invest part of his city’s pension fund in bitcoin. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., was toying with a challenge to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul when he co-sponsored a resolution calling blockchain technology “the future of innovation.” Between them, the two represented an emerging trend among ambitious Democrats: Candidates angling for state office are touting support for the cryptocurrency industry. For crypto, the trend could yield rewards. Industry players would like to see friendly state-level financial regulation, loose rules for energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining, and potentially even state pension fund investments in their products. One industry critic chalked up the trend of Democrats paying homage to crypto to the industry’s money cannon. “I think it boils down to two words: opportunism and fear,” said Mark Hays, who works for the groups advocacy groups Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. “I don’t think it gets more nuanced than that.” For politicians, the push for crypto could draw votes from the young men mostly likely to trade crypto, but there could be bigger rewards to be reaped by attracting deep-pocketed industry donors. Supporters of crypto threw around large sums of money in last year’s elections for national offices and won nearly across the board. “The crypto industry, because the industry can print its own money, somewhat literally and metaphorically, it is able to pull a lot of money into electoral races and lobbying activity,” Hays said. “Right now, a lot of folks are worried about being on the wrong side of that money.” The move, though, could also invite backlash from Democratic primary voters at a time when the Dogecoin brand has been coopted by Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn government office and President Donald Trump has launched a meme coin of his own. Cryptocurrency companies have taken an improbable journey over the past decade from Silicon Valley startups to Washington power players. They first flexed their might in 2022, when Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives at the fraudulent crypto platform FTX showered tens of millions of dollars on Democratic and Republican campaigns. Bankman-Fried was behind bars by 2024, but other industry figures banded together on a super PAC that spent nearly $200 million on congressional races. The group was officially bipartisan and spent millions on Democrats, but it leaned Republican. The spending allocation may have ended up helping tip control of the Senate to Republicans and alienated one Democratic megadonor, who quit the effort in protest and eventually received a refund for his contribution. Last year, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the crypto’s top legislative priority, a bill called Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century, or FIT 21, that would slide most cryptocurrencies under an industry-friendly regulatory agency called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Many Democrats were in favor of the bill — including two running in the crowded primary for the New Jersey governor’s race. Both of them, Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, have been rated by the trade group Stand With Crypto as “strongly” supporting the industry. Neither Sherrill nor Gottheimer has talked up crypto on the campaign trail, and the issue has largely flown under the radar, according to an observer of state politics. “To most of the public, they haven’t encountered it in the gubernatorial race,” said Kristoffer Shields, the director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University. Shields still believes there are voters who care intensely about the issue, given the many finance industry professionals who work in New York City and Philadelphia but live in New Jersey. Fulop, the Jersey City mayor and a former Goldman Sachs banker, may have had those voters in mind when he announced in July that he would be investing part of Jersey City’s pension fund in bitcoin. Fulop said on X that he had “been a long time believer (through ups/downs) in crypto” and that blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, “is amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet.” In a statement, Fulop said the city has allocated only a small percentage of its pension holdings to bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund and that it has performed well since the purchases began in November. State pension funds represent an attractive opportunity for crypto companies, who have begun lobbying states to invest in their products. If elected to the governor’s mansion, Fulop said he would be open to investing some of the state’s pension money in cryptocurrencies. “Similar to what we’ve done with Jersey City’s pension fund, I believe in asset class diversification as a responsible investment strategy,” he said. “Allocating 1 to 2 percent of a portfolio to crypto can provide reasonable exposure while managing risk appropriately.” From a political perspective, Shields said, investing in crypto could worry voters about losing money on risky bets. He believes, however, that associating with crypto also provides politicians to grab on to a rare issue that cuts across party lines. “Most constituents haven’t thought too much about it or don’t care about it,” he said. “But the ones who do care care a lot.” So far, the industry has not directed its vast campaign holdings into the New Jersey gubernatorial race. At least three of the Democrats have received campaign donations from crypto companies or leaders, however. Crypto-aligned super PACs spent $242,000 backing Gottheimer during the last election cycle and crypto figures donated $51,000 directly to his campaign organizations, according to the tracker website Follow the Crypto. Money donated to his federal campaign account cannot be transferred to his state account. Industry figures have given far less — $3,333 — to Sherrill, who is leading in the polls so far. A super PAC supporting Fulop, meanwhile, received a $10,000 donation from Gregory Tusar, a vice president at the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. “Greg and I have been personal friends for 20 years,” Fulop said in a statement. “We worked together in algorithmic trading at Goldman Sachs long before cryptocurrency even existed. His support of Coalition for Progress has nothing to do with the crypto industry.” Across the Hudson River, the contours of the 2026 New York governor’s race are already taking shape. Sitting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s weak poll numbers have encouraged other Democrats to consider a primary challenge. Hochul in 2022 earned the enmity of the crypto industry by signing a two-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining, which was motivated by concerns from environmentalists that it would incentivize the reopening of dirty power plants. So far, two rumored Democratic contenders to Hochul have strong connections to crypto. Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado was backed by a $1 million donation from an SBF-associated super PAC during his 2022 campaign, which drew accusations that he was supported by “dirty” money even before the collapse of FTX. Delgado’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Torres, the New York representative in Washington, has repeatedly touted the benefits of crypto from his perch in Congress. He lambasted regulators under former President Joe Biden for trying to crack down on companies such as Ripple Labs and Coinbase for violating securities laws. Both companies contributed to a network of super PACs that backed Torres with $173,000 in spending during the last election cycle. (Torres did not respond to a request for comment.) During his time in Congress, he has sponsored at least eight pro-crypto measures, the most recent a resolution expressing general support for digital assets and blockchain technology. “Blockchain technology and digital assets represent the future of innovation, economic growth, and financial inclusion,” Torres said in a February 5 statement accompanying the measure’s introduction. “The United States must lead in shaping a regulatory framework that fosters technological advancement while protecting consumers and ensuring transparency. By embracing this next generation, we can create a more equitable financial system that benefits every American.”  Original reporting. Fearless journalism.

Torres, one of two Democrats to co-sponsor the crypto resolution, was embracing crypto at a moment when crypto was embracing Trump. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was one of the first executives to meet with Trump after his election in November. Last week, the company announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission would drop a 2023 lawsuit against it. One of the biggest launches in the crypto world in recent months was by Trump himself, with the introduction hours before his inauguration of the $TRUMP token. The Trump coin sparked a backlash in the crypto world from figures who worried it would harm the industry’s reputation. Hays, the advocate with Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, said candidates should be cautious when embracing the industry, because they may wind up embracing a worldview that alienates their voters. “Many, many people are concerned about what Elon Musk is doing. There is not much daylight at all between Elon Musk’s worldview, his goals and objectives, his ideas about how society should effectively be run by techno elites, and key leading figures of the crypto industry,” he said. “Those people see crypto as not only a representation of that worldview, but a means to an end.” WAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet.

        "title": "Definitive Oral History Of BuzzFeed News 2012–2023 ",
        "text": "BuzzFeed News has been described as a chaos agent, a pirate ship, a reputable news organization, and, most notably, a “failing pile of garbage” by former president Donald Trump. We wanted to tell our own story — in our own words — about what it was like to be a part of it. BuzzFeed News BuzzFeed launched a news section in 2012. It hired a ton of people, opened international offices, produced podcasts and shows, formed a union, won a Pulitzer Prize. Then it shuttered international offices, laid people off, and on Friday, May 5, shut down for good and archived its website. Hundreds of people worked here over the years and made this place what it was — this oral history is an incomplete account of what made this place both extraordinary and exasperating. There are so many stories and people missing, either because it got too long, we ran out of time, or we had to delete some of the really juicy stuff. (Testimonials have been edited for length and clarity.) If your interest is an analysis of the business forces that led to this moment, there are plenty of thorough and smart assessments (our former editor-in-chief just wrote a whole book, awkwardly released the same week we were told we needed to close, about how digital media was doomed.) We wanted to make this oral history so that the final word on BuzzFeed News (literally, the last thing to be published on our site) would come from the people who worked here. If you’re reading this, or have read our stories before, thank you. If you watched our shows, listened to our podcasts, clicked on our push alerts and tweets, or scrolled past our headlines on your phone, we want to sincerely thank you for supporting us, sharing our work, and helping us survive (and even thrive!) in a chaotic media landscape as long as we did. — Katie Notopoulos McKay Coppins, former politics reporter: In the beginning, “BuzzFeed News” was basically Ben Smith, Rosie Gray, Zeke Miller, Andrew Kaczynski, and me covering the 2012 Republican presidential primaries. Ben’s instructions to us were basically: Don’t waste time doing the same stories everyone is doing. Break news, get scoops, make trouble. I remember at the first Republican presidential debate in early 2012, Ben named our portable Wi-Fi thing “BUZZFEED SURVEILLANCE DRONE” so that the other outlets would see it on their laptops and get freaked out. Doree Shafrir, former executive editor: Ben Smith sent me a DM on Twitter and asked if I wanted to meet with him — it was before he had actually started but his hiring had been announced. I remember the process going fairly quickly — I met with Jonah Peretti and Ken Lerer, and then it was done. Those first few months of 2012 were bananas. I started in February — I think I was employee No. 65 — and we were hiring multiple people per week. The mandate was to grow grow grow. There was no real sense from Ben about what it took to launch or maintain multiple lifestyle and entertainment verticals — like we should just launch a sports vertical, covering national sports, with two or three people. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: I was hired in early 2012 to do the viral list stuff. Michael Hastings, who was a big-time actual journalist, sat next to me. He’d be on the phone like, screaming at Reince Priebus and I’d be looking at a Tumblr of Sonic the Hedgehog erotica. We got along great. One time I had to actually call someone for a post, and Ben Smith said to me, “Look at you, you’re doing reporting!” I was disgusted. At the time, “news” was just a handful of verticals: politics, tech, sports, “women’s interest.” It was fluid between the viral and news people. We had a big weekly meeting where we’d dissect the top-performing posts and why they worked. There was a giant TV screen that showed the leaderboard of who had the most traffic. Around 2014, there was an official segmenting of “News” from “Buzz” (viral lists and quizzes) and “Life” (food, fashion DIY). At some point in a reorg that seemed, from the plebes within, to be a result of some sort of nightmare Mothra vs. Godzilla fight, Buzz and Life were moved under Ze Frank, who ran video, and Ben Smith was in charge of just news. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: I was always ambivalent about splitting News. It felt culturally inevitable after the political and social climate changed, but it played to journalists’ worst, snobbish instincts in some ways. We worked for BuzzFeed, after all, and it pulled News toward feeling like a charity. It seemed necessary at the time — in the Trump era, News was too dark to be next to the BuzzFeed Brand — but I had some worries. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: The first time I set foot in the BuzzFeed office was December 2011 for a meeting with Ben and the other three reporters he’d hired to cover the 2012 election. Ben said to us something to the effect of “Tell people you’re with BuzzFeed the same way you would tell them you’re with the New York Times.” I officially started a couple weeks later. I drove Ben back to New York after the New Hampshire primary, and he spent half the drive on his computer writing a story. We talked about whether I was going to finish college, and we both halfheartedly said that I really should, and I think we both knew it wasn’t going to happen. Michael Hastings reports from the Obama campaign trail the day before the general election, Nov. 5, 2012, in Des Moines, Iowa. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: I fell in love with BuzzFeed back during the 2012 election. I consumed anything and everything Michael Hastings, Ruby Cramer, and McKay Coppins wrote. When BuzzFeed hired Andrew Kaczynski, I decided there was nowhere else I wanted to work. Andrew had built a name for himself by aggressively digging up old C-SPAN clips of Republican primary candidates. I decided that if there is a place out there weird enough to hire the Old C-SPAN Clips Guy, they might be weird enough to hire me. John Herrman, former tech editor: I remember the office in 2012 with white walls and red pipes. Good view. When it rained our internet was bad, because it was being beamed from the Empire State Building. Three grinning visages haunted the room. Jonah Peretti. Ben Smith. Jon Steinberg. Your goal was to avoid eye contact with them. One way I can describe Ben and Jonah, who are otherwise fairly different people, is as guys who seem like they’d never make eye contact who instead make it all the time. A birthday party for Grumpy Cat goes on in one conference room in 21st Street office in New York City, while John Herrman tries to work in another, circa 2012. Ellie Hall, senior reporter: I was the first person to be hired for the newly formed “News” team in 2013. The first big test of our operation was the Boston Marathon bombings, and those long days made it clear to all of us that we needed an adult in the room. Enter Lisa Tozzi. She came to the office before she was officially hired for a sort of “meet your possible boss” group lunch/interview, and we were all blown away. We all swarmed Ben and essentially demanded that he hire her as news director. We all looked up to her — literally, because she was one of the first people in the entire office to use a standing desk. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: I hired Lisa Tozzi to run the breaking news team. I remember how impressed I was by Lisa — but then how massively impressed everyone was to have someone descend from the heights of the New York Times to join us, and then being a little annoyed by that because why should everyone be so worshipful of the Times! Lisa Tozzi, former news director: I was in Ben’s office or something at the old District 9, crowded, vermin-infested 21st Street office. Some Anthony Weiner stuff was happening, and Ellie Hall came running over and slapped this on the glass. (We blurred, I believe.) Zoe Tillman, former politics reporter: The day I interviewed in the New York office it was Ben Smith’s birthday. There were pieces of paper with a close-up photo of Ben’s face taped up all over the walls as I entered the building. When I got to the newsroom, everyone in the room was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of Ben. His face was everywhere. Tom Namako, former news director: I used to literally turn on the lights and unlock the doors at the office above Home Depot at 5:55 a.m. and would find McKay sometimes sitting with Diet Coke cans around him, just agonizing over his computer, on the floor. He’d scare the shit out of me. McKay Coppins, former politics reporter: There was a stretch where I was staying late at the office writing several nights a week and there was this one coworker I didn’t really know who would show up after midnight and sort of nod at me from a distance and then just...stay. Somewhere in the office. I’m pretty sure she was living there, but I didn’t know for sure. BuzzFeed News staffers Myles Tanzer, Johana Bhuiyan, Katie Notopoulos, and Charlie Warzel Tom Warren, investigative reporter: The first time I visited the New York office, I stepped over the threshold only to be greeted by a man on a hoverboard holding a tray of sex toys, some of which were frankly quite terrifying. He registered my surprise, then cackled and sped off down the corridor. I never found out why he was doing that or whether HR should have gotten involved. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter: I’d come from the Village Voice, and other local papers before that, and every place I’d worked was facing existential crisis. Then suddenly, Adam Serwer recruits me onto BuzzFeed’s National desk, and there’s free lunch and tons of happy-looking people hopping around. It felt like a fantasy — excess and money and bright colors and whimsically shaped chairs all around. I couldn’t believe such a place existed in the journalism industry. I remember my first BuzzFeed Christmas party, in 2014, walking into this fancy club space, in lower Manhattan, dim lights, lots of dancing. And, there, up on a stage: acrobats and fire dancers. I remember thinking, like, Damn, either we’re saved or we’re doomed. Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: On my first day, an email went out to the office: Kanye West was coming in for a visit with Jonah. When I got down to their floor, Kanye was sitting in a tight office, wildly gesticulating while Jonah sat there impassively. I snuck a picture and then tweeted it out. A few minutes later, another email went out: We shouldn’t gather around Jonah’s office, and we definitely shouldn’t be posting pictures about the visit. Heh, it was too late. I didn’t delete the tweet, and I’ve still got the picture. Kanye West talks to Jonah Peretti in the BuzzFeed offices. Dan Vergano, former science reporter: I started work in February on a cold Tuesday morning [in the DC office], and waited. Then this big dude came shambling up to the door I had been buzzing to get into for 10 minutes, lit a cigarette, and asked me if I was Dan. It was John Stanton, who I quickly figured out was actually a friend of a bouncer friend of my wife’s from my misspent youth in DC. My new colleagues all struck me as twentysomething strivers, but with perpetual hangovers. It took me about a week to figure out everyone was reporting and writing their pieces on their phone. Venessa Wong, senior culture reporter: My first job here in 2015 was to report on food companies. I did a really simple post about McDonald’s selling mozzarella sticks for $1, just something short and fun that I put very little time into, and suddenly half a million people had read that story. It was a level of reach I had never experienced before, and it was absolutely thrilling and terrifying. There was a clear sense that if something was being said online, people were hearing it from BuzzFeed. Hayes Brown, former deputy world news editor: It was an absolute dream of a gig to work under World desk editor Miriam Elder and in the pirate ship that DC Bureau Chief John Stanton was running. I was so proud (and to be frank, a little smug) when I’d tell people all the cities where we had correspondents based, which over the years included Mexico City, Istanbul, Nairobi, Dakar, Beijing, Hong Kong, New Delhi, and Moscow. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: Despite the warnings of more experienced journalists that I would be mad to work at BuzzFeed, I applied as soon as they opened an investigations unit. All we wanted to do was blow the fucking doors off…and guess what happens when you give a group of twentysomethings unlimited resources to chase stories? They go batshit crazy. Absolutely fucking bananas. We flew round the world chasing tips, conducted surveillance ops on money launderers, took sources out for mindblowingly expensive meals in the hope of getting leaked documents, rode through rainforests on the back of motorbikes, and engaged in a host of other wild adventures, not all of which are fit to print. There were wild parties, lots of them. One week you would be at a warehouse rave in Brooklyn, and two weeks later you would be flying into Istanbul for security training and heading for a night out with whichever members of the press corps were in town. We had the wind at our backs and had a beast of a fucking time. It was majestic. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter: I think one reason the vibes were always so positive, and the place never felt internally competitive the way some other newsrooms do, is that we had this collective mindset of abundance. To put it crudely, we were all trying to build our newsroom’s credibility, so every colleague's success helped elevate your own reputation. For a while, the newsroom would echo with the same script: Hi, my name is so-and-so, I’m a reporter with BuzzFeed News, and I’m working on a... BuzzFeed... B-U-Z-Z-F-E-E-D... it’s a digital news outlet...\" That was like the soundtrack of those early days. It became a running joke. But then eventually, maybe by early 2016, we didn't have to spell it out anymore. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: I had been at the Believer Magazine (which had literally no budget for anything) and Saeed Jones called me and said he wanted me to join and start a literary magazine within BuzzFeed News with him. Then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened, and suddenly I was swept into the news cycle. Ben Smith told me culture touched everything so I had to find a way to cover…everything. Soon after, I was sending reporters to Trump rallies and all over the country covering news. When I first started, I asked what our budget was for the Culture desk and was told, “Don’t ask or you might get one,” from someone who worked in Finance. When I saw what editors were paying for stories on other desks I was in absolute shock. I knew it couldn’t last. Saeed Jones (left) and Isacc Fitzgerald pose for a publicity photos for BuzzFeed News’ morning Twitter show AM2DM. Doree Shafrir, former executive editor: There was so much organizational-slash-strategy whiplash. Like they would launch projects and it would be the hot new thing for like six months and then they would be like, Actually, never mind. The relationship between News and main BuzzFeed, and then with video, was insane. Like, no one was in charge. Brandon Hardin, curation editor: For a while it felt like the only money you could depend on was from social media platforms for shows. AM2DM was funded by Twitter, sort of a morning talk show. Facebook gave us money for Profile, hosted by Audie Cornish, when they still had the laughable idea people were going to watch longform journalism on Facebook. Other shows, including a game show, were spun up, wound down, and forgotten about. We had a podcast for a bit you could summon on Alexa. In theory. Because it turned out calling a podcast “The News By BuzzFeed News” made it basically impossible to call up, as Alexa stopped listening after the first “news.” Julia Moser, former AM2DM producer: The pitch for AM2DM was essentially “the Today show/Good Morning America but our anchors are allowed to say ‘fuck’ and wear jeans.” Our original motto was “All the news too lit to print” and then the New York Times sent us a cease and desist I believe? There was one week where I produced a segment about MS-13 with John Stanton and also was trying to book Bruno, a very fat cat who’d gone viral on Twitter, which to me was BuzzFeed News and AM2DM in a nutshell. Zach Ares, senior motion designer and drag queen: For one of their first promos, AM2DM made a video called “Tucker Carlson looks at his guests like they’re eating mayo straight out of the jar”... and then Jesse McLaren, and hosts Saeed Jones and Isaac Fitzgerald, ate a full jar of mayo on camera. [Editor’s note: Saeed and Isaac actually ate vanilla pudding. Still gross.] Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: I like to imagine Elon Musk’s face if he ever finds out that Twitter paid to run a BuzzFeed News morning show. That’s worth it all. Veronica Dulin, DC office manager/editorial assistant: I was the office manager and had to escort all the AM2DM guests up to the top floor. One day, the guest was the attorney general of Texas, who was accompanied by an armed security team. During the interview, a guy sidled up to me and said, “Hey, we can’t find our friend Chris. I think he’s trapped somewhere.” The elevator in the DC office was always breaking down, and I feared the worst. We found him trapped on the fifth floor, and we had to yank the doors of the broken elevator open to get him out. I spent the whole time bonding with this man to try and get him to not tell mean stories about how the liberal news outlet trapped him. After the interview, Zoe Tillman, who had interviewed the AG, came up to me and asked which guy got caught. I told her and she said, “Oh my god, that’s Chris SCALIA.” I trapped the son of a Supreme Court justice in the elevator. David Mack, senior reporter: I was one of the fill-in hosts for AM2DM, which meant I got to interview a ton of big name stars on camera. Producers would also try to ensure I got to interview every famous Aussie that came through, including Guy Pearce, Jacki Weaver, and Toni Collette. The viewership of the show would mostly depend on whether Twitter boosted it on the platform, which was worrying from the start. I also helped host shows we briefly had on Facebook (Profile) and Snapchat (BTW). All of these received money from the platforms, which of course was not going to last forever. But that’s just how it was. I was hired to write and edit, and all of a sudden I was hosting TV. It felt like we were really booming into a full media division. I trace it back to when homepage editor Gavon Laessig did a Facebook Live on Super Tuesday for the 2016 election and we got a ton of views by doing stunts like making him take shots when a different race was called. He got smashed, but it was fun! And then suddenly we were in the live news business. Tom Namako, former news director: Gavon Laessig’s Facebook Live election show needs an oral history of its own. He threw up on the floor of politics editor Katherine Miller’s office, and she never went back in again because of the smell. We basically held him hostage in there for eight hours feeding him only bourbon and, I think, ice cream. Gavon Laessig, former breaking news editor: The pitch for this Facebook Live show was “Watch As Super Tuesday Ruins This Man’s Night One State At A Time.” I would do drinking games while I interviewed politics editors and reporters, all while providing real-time updates to the 2016 presidential primaries. A microphone, several bottles of liquor, and a tub of peanut butter were placed in front of me. At one point I put Mentos in my mouth and swigged Diet Coke, simply destroying the carpet with a geyser of foam spraying out of my mouth. I think I did this for four or five hours before Lisa Tozzi and Shani Hilton, legitimately concerned for my health, pulled the plug. They kept feeding me seltzer so I’d have something besides ice cream and Southern Comfort in my stomach. Shockingly, I don’t remember many of the details. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: Being in the LA office, a lot of our shows felt like “a New York thing” that I didn’t have any connection with beyond waking up to some amazing content every morning, but there were eventually some that were more anchored with LA: Hella Opinions was an amazing talk show on Wednesday nights, and there was also a short-lived HQ Trivia knockoff called Outside Your Bubble. There was a period of time in my life where I had to help oversee a nightly game show in the Facebook app? Emerson Malone, copy editor: We had a short-lived experimental video animated series on Spotify, of all places. It was something that required animators and graphic designers, and it would come down to West Coast copy editors to look at it late at night. The video would go live in the morning, but by then it would be yesterday’s news if not news from two days previous. And it was a video… that lived somewhere… on Spotify. Julia Furlan, former head of audio: From what I can tell, some bigwig at Spotify approached Ben and said, “We want to experiment with video,” and Ben was like, “OK sure, why don’t we make a video podcast?” But it would have been way too complicated to do longform video podcasts and Spotify didn’t want that. So we decided to adapt our daily podcast into video. In order to do that, Spotify needed us to upload our video every day by 4 a.m. And thanks to Dennis Huynh, the amazing design director and a team of animators who worked overnight in India, we managed to figure it out. And then Spotify just like….didn’t upload it. Like, every day we were doing this absurd task and Spotify’s team could not figure out how to play it in their app. Emerson Malone: Copy also looked at each episode of the Netflix show Follow This, which was sometimes wild, because in one of Scaachi’s episodes I literally had to ask: Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: That sex doll episode still haunts me. We went to the house of a guy who owned four dolls, and he had them hanging by their necks on the wall. One of our camera guys had to help move one, and he lifted the doll to repose her (these things are like 120 pounds of dead weight), and after he did it, he had two huge boob-sized prints on his shirt. It turns out you have to dust the sex dolls with cornstarch so that the skin feels like skin and doesn’t get sticky. BuzzFeed staffers are photographed with Bill Murray at the 23rd Street office in 2015. BuzzFeed staffers reluctantly pose with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in New York City. Julia Reinstein, senior reporter: I remember one time there was someone running around the office in a ghost mask scaring people, and I later found out it was Bella Thorne. Another time, I was playing with several puppies that were in the office for a video when Seth Rogen suddenly popped his head out of a room. He made direct eye contact with me as I was lying on the floor covered in puppies and nearly crying. Johana Bhuiyan, former tech reporter: BuzzFeed is probably the only place I could make eye contact with T.I. while trying to decide which pieces of day-old sushi from yesterday’s free lunch were likely to hurt my stomach the least. Emma Loop, former BuzzFeed Canada and politics reporter: I was in the New York newsroom one time – I think I was there working with the investigations team on some money trail stuff. All of a sudden I heard singing. As I followed the sound, I discovered Hanson — yes, the ’90s boy band of “MMMBop” fame — playing a concert in the canteen. Jason Wells, executive editor of news: At the Beverly office In LA, Paul Rudd (a crush for many of us) visited the office for a photo shoot to promote a movie. We all positioned ourselves in the warehouse-open floor plan office to get as good a view as possible when he was ushered through to the photo set. He arrived, we all freaked out on Slack. Then Paul saw the Slack conversation in the studio room on an employee’s laptop and started typing in the channel, which meant he saw all our thirsty slacks. He then marched out into the office area and yelled something like “How DARE you all objectify me!” before laughing. We all freaked out. Paul Rudd (left) and Jason Wells in the LA offices of BuzzFeed News Paul McLeod, former politics reporter: During the 2016 Republican National Convention, BuzzFeed News threw a big, swanky party on a rooftop hotel in downtown Cleveland. I look over and see Rudy Giuliani in the corner drinking scotch and smoking cigars. Our DC bureau chief, John Stanton, was a tall, heavily tattooed man who wore black and lots of skull rings. Lovely guy, but apparently Giuliani’s bodyguards thought he was some kind of anarchist because when he approached Rudy to ask a question they tackled him to the ground. David Mack, senior reporter: On the night of the 2016 election, I was working in the newsroom in New York. We were doing a huge live show on one of the social media platforms (with dozens of professional outside crew members) and they had planned all this fun stuff. Quickly, the mood turned. That morning, I’d gone for a jog and thought to myself, On the random chance that Trump wins, I should just publish a post of people swearing different swear words on Twitter. I did end up getting to publish that at 2:45 a.m., but Ben made me put the headline “Well, Fuck” in quotes so it didn’t seem like it was us saying it — which I think was cowardly! I went home, stared at the ceiling for two hours, came back to work, and Ben, to his credit, gave an inspiring speech to the newsroom about getting started on the most important work of our careers. Steve Kandell, former features editor: On election night 2016, Charlie Warzel, Miriam Elder, and I were talking in the hallway right as things were just starting to turn and feel weird. The Decision Desk dude walked out of the bathroom and said, “It’s all happening,” and he was just in there throwing up. That seemed bad. From left: Ben Smith, Janine Gibson, Shani Hilton, and Mark Schoofs Hayes Brown, former deputy world news editor: My desk in 2016 was right in front of the executive suite of offices. I remember seeing a flurry of activity one night, with Ben Smith, Miriam Elder, and Mark Schoofs all hustling around with a clear sense of urgency but nobody letting on why. At one point, I looked over and saw Ben crouched down typing away at a laptop perched on a shelf only a foot or two off the floor. Minutes later, The dossier was online. Matt Mittenthal, communications director: I’d just accepted the job of running comms for BuzzFeed News but hadn’t started. Ben published the dossier at 6:20 p.m. on Jan. 10 [2017], then sent me this: Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: On March 6, 2020, Tom Namako sent out an email telling us to start bringing all our stuff home every day — laptop, mouse, keyboard, etc. That was when we were still doing stories of couples navigating coronavirus-era dating and working from home together, and I thought BuzzFeed was maybe a bit too panicked about the pandemic. I’ve never been more wrong because a few days later, on March 11, everything happened. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter: I get a call from our science editor, Azeen, asking if I can go to New Rochelle to report on the first coronavirus containment zone in the US. On my way up there the following day, I dropped by the office, where Tom Namako gave me a bunch of safety gear. For the mask to fit properly, I had to shave my beard, which probably stands as the greatest sacrifice I’ve ever made for this company. Employees of the San Francisco bureau of BuzzFeed News Mat Honan, former San Francisco bureau chief: Something I figured out pretty quickly was that — at least in those days — there was no budgetary limit on ambitious work. Incredible! The answer to “Can we spend this?” was always “Yes” if it was a good story. Caroline O’Donovan, former tech reporter: Mat Honan told the San Francisco office he had this big surprise. It turned out to be the BuzzFeed Open Lab, a giant glass box where we paid these engineers and nerds $100,000 a year to make stuff with projectors and animatronic stuffed animals. It was supposed to be like a media tech incubator; Mat said it would have soldering irons and welding equipment. When it opened we threw a big party and people kept crashing their hoverboards into the walls. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: More than once I would ask an editor if it was unreasonable to take a source to a £150-a-head restaurant. If the source was good enough, the answer was always yes. My time at BuzzFeed meant my tastes have become expensive. But alongside all the wild spending, the truth is that a lot of money was spent on reporting. Other newsrooms asked journalists to take risks, without considering their safety. We had an excellent security team to look after us, and editors would spend thousands chasing a story. That meant we often beat the big players like the New York Times or the Guardian, which was a delicious feeling. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: In my recollection, 2014 to 2016 was really the peak in terms of the feeling that there were unlimited resources. Even the most far-flung, expensive reporting trips would get approved, and we were constantly hiring. By that point I was in DC and we were doing these BuzzFeed Brews events with various notables and having big White House Correspondents Dinner parties. This was the era captured in that Awl thing that was like “I hate my life because I don’t work for BuzzFeed.” Veronica Dulin, DC office manager/editorial assistant: Holy shit, the WHCA Dinner afterparties. As someone who saw the budgets, they were all open bar for hundreds of people, including a ton who weren’t on the guest list, and which everyone at the company could bring like 10 people they wanted to. They’d lay off journalists …then throw this fucking rager for tens of thousands of dollars in April in order to get what, access for the journalists we’d laid off?? It was absolutely insane and only done for clout. They threw those after the Facebook bubble. What were they doing??? Photo editor Laura Geiser works in the “attic” of the BuzzFeed LA offices. The attic was notorious for having low beams that ran across the space. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: When I first started in the Beverly office in LA in 2016, I remember being told we had a valet, and I was so confused. This was normal? Yes, apparently it was. We had several valet workers parking and getting our cars for us every day. Some of the people who worked in that office were in their early 20s and had never worked anywhere else so they thought this was normal, I guess? I had heard about excesses in tech companies but I had to call my immigrant parents to tell them we had a valet who was parking my car every day because it was so wild to me. And I remember my mom asking how we were making money to pay for all of this, and I said, “Who knows?” Jessica Garrison, former investigations reporter: There was fresh Pressed $9 juice several times a week delivered to the LA office. Ken Bensinger, former investigative reporter: Peak tech company excess moment might have been the holiday swag announcement in 2014 (or was it 2015?) when Jonah did a show and kept saying \"But wait, there's more!” We all got duffel bags, sweatpants, sweatshirts, and socks, and a weird little key fob with the number of employees on staff at the time. Then, in 2016, he did the holiday swag announcement with his hoodie pulled up and it looked like a hostage video, and that's when we knew the wave had crested and moved on. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: An incomplete list of things BuzzFeed gave all employees while I was there: iPad MiniApple WatchWinter pompom hats in six-plus different colors, one for each yearA woven blanket with the viral arrowA fleece blanket that was just colorfulThree-plus pairs of BuzzFeed branded socksThree-plus tote bagsFive T-shirts with different city office names on them, all in one yearOne longsleeve BuzzFeed shirtUncountable T-shirts tied to eventsTwo BuzzFeed hoodiesOne pair of BuzzFeed sweatpantsTwo pairs Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones, brandedA BuzzFeed backpackA BuzzFeed duffel-style gym bagSeveral drink kooziesA limited-edition print of a drawing of a cat made by a machine by artist Cory Arcangel Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: There was the infamous cat drawing by Jonah’s friend Cory Arcangel that we all received as a holiday present one year. It was literally a really basic line drawing of a cat, like a doodle, on computer paper. Each copy was individually numbered, and Jonah claimed these artworks would appreciate in value. We were dying laughing about this. I think I still have it somewhere. Claudia Koerner, deputy director breaking news: The LA Christmas party was at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter one year, presumably through the deal we had with NBC Universal. We had the run of the park, and a bunch of us on News just rode the roller coaster again and again. There was food and an open bar, but if you wanted to spike your Butterbeer, you had to do it on the sly. David Mack, senior reporter: For the first few years, we also had Pride parties at massive New York City event spaces. These weren’t just for BuzzFeed staffers, either. I think they were cosponsored by alcohol brands, but it was still nuts. At my first holiday party at Webster Hall, I got so drunk (everyone was) that I made a point of thanking Jonah in person for all the drinks, then climbed on a little platform all the gays were dancing on. When I stepped off, I slipped on a puddle of booze and hit my ribs and was injured for weeks. As the years went by, the Pride parties ended, and the holiday parties became smaller and smaller. Once they stopped allowing us to bring our partners, I was like, Uh-oh. The BuzzFeed News curation team in November 2019 Jason Wells, executive editor of news: I’ll never forget how Ben Smith sent me to help staff up and resettle our news team in Sydney with explicit instructions to use my corporate card to wine and dine the staff, make everyone feel special, and meet with potential business partners. I was there for a month and did just that. A few months later, after I returned, we laid the entire team off to save money. BuzzFeed staffers in the London office enjoy oysters for lunch in 2017. Ikran Dahir, internet culture reporter: I remember the day the London office got oysters for our free lunch like it was yesterday. It was May 2017. Everyone laughed when we saw the lunch announcement in the morning because surely not actual oysters? But there they were at lunchtime, and not many of us ate them. That wasn’t the only time a free meal at work was slightly fancy. On one Friday, there were breakfast mimosas! All of this felt very ridiculous when redundancies in the UK were announced just a few months later that year. Ema O'Connor and Weed Dude talk in the 11th floor newsroom of the New York offices Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: I left in the summer of 2017, before things really got bad. But I always, always suspected that things weren’t sustainable. I’d worked in the media long enough to know that eventually we’d have to make money and we kept hiring so many people. I’m probably getting this wrong, but I think we hired roughly two people a day from 2014 to 2015. Opened lots of offices overseas and domestically. Everyone seemed to understand the ride was going to be fun, but short. My editor — one of the loveliest, best people I know — always used to say: “Joel, just spend the money!” Which was a nice thought, but it seemed so shortsighted. I’d come from places where they’d taken out coffeemakers and even cut back on toilet paper. The bills were always going to come due. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: I think the writing was on the wall in the international offices far earlier. Colleagues we worked with in France and then Germany were unceremoniously sacked, and the London office faced wave after wave of heartbreaking layoffs. There was a lot of anger in those early sackings — we all had a sort of codependent relationship with BuzzFeed, and people felt like they were being dumped. Adam B. Vary, former entertainment reporter: In October 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published their blockbuster stories about Harvey Weinstein, and Ben, who’d spent years treating the Entertainment News desk with benign neglect, suddenly became fixated on the fact that we had not, somehow, landed the biggest and most difficult entertainment news story in my lifetime. By the end of that month, our team was split up, our editor (my third — of five!) resigned, and an internal memo was leaked to the trades which singled out “the holes in our Weinstein coverage” for the changes. It felt punitive and arbitrary, and I’m clearly still a little mad about it, but more importantly, it burst that magic feeling of my first four years at BuzzFeed. I realized how precarious everything actually was, so when the first round of layoffs hit in 2019, it just felt like the trajectory of the place was no longer ascendant. Julia Furlan, former head of audio: One afternoon, water started pouring out of a pipe in the ceiling right over the Pod Squad desks, so we had to move all our stuff. A media reporter from the Wall Street Journal had already started asking our producers if we were getting laid off, and the execs were like, “Let’s wait until the water situation is resolved, and then we will lay you off.” Instead I said, “No, do it now,” and so they unceremoniously called us one by one into their office as the water continued to pour into the newsroom. They laid off the whole team; it was ice cold. They said we didn’t have the numbers, but the truth is they didn’t have any idea what they were doing with us. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter: What really birthed the union was when management shuttered the Pod Squad in October 2018. Every person on that team was beloved, extremely talented, and doing exceptional work — and on top of that, these were mostly women and people of color. The news was shocking, and the meeting in the newsroom when Ben and Shani announced it was gutting. A bunch of people were crying. I really couldn’t believe that leadership had no idea how to make podcasting profitable, when we had such an impressive head start in a direction the industry was so clearly going in. It was the moment I lost trust in the folks making the big decisions. It was the moment that radicalized me, from someone who casually supported the idea of a union to someone volunteering to help lead the organizing effort. I went to my first union meeting that night, and the NewsGuild conference room was filled with other colleagues who were also making their first appearance. Before that day, just a handful of colleagues were actively participating in the effort. Afterward, damn near the whole newsroom was on board. David Mack, senior reporter: Once we started closing international offices (RIP BuzzFeed Canada, BuzzFeed France, BuzzFeed Mexico, BuzzFeed News Oz), it was clear to everyone we’d expanded too fast and the good times were coming to an end. We still were trying new things, but the years of unchecked spending were over. Gradually, we became more like an establishment outlet and less of an underdog startup. When Ben left for the Times, I realized there were the Ben boom years and the Ben bust years, and I think he’d admit that he wasn’t having as much fun towards the end with our first mass layoffs in early 2019. Those were horrific. I saw managers weeping. I wept. But we soldiered on as best we could, even if we did spend the next few years trying to fight as we were getting limbs chopped off like the Black Knight from Monty Python. Despite all this, the closure comes as a shock. We were told we had more time, and we were hitting the goals they’d set for us. Venessa Wong, senior culture reporter: BuzzFeed’s business model kept changing. When I joined in 2015, native advertising seemed like the future. Because we weren’t relying on banner ads and pop-ups like other sites, our story pages were so clean. Yet from the perspective of someone far away from the decision makers at the company before it was publicly reporting financials, the business seemed off. The company had already had layoffs in 2017 because it had failed to reach revenue goals, and many more rounds would follow. When BuzzFeed spun off a separate news website (BuzzfeedNews.com) in 2018, I was seriously worried that we were being cut off from the lifeblood of BuzzFeed.com, and its massive audience, not to mention its sales and business resources. When BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost in 2020 and were told we would continue to operate completely independently and compete with them for stories, many of us worried how long the company would want to run two newsrooms. Gina Rushton, former reproductive rights reporter, Australia: I wouldn’t change a second of it, except maybe for the inevitable end to us being a forgotten outpost when we got unceremoniously laid off, at 2 a.m. our time, on my birthday, in the early scary days of a pandemic. This is embarrassing but I remember trying to calculate how my salary compared to the cost of the frozen yogurt machine in the New York office. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: I returned to BuzzFeed in 2019 after working for the Atlantic for a couple years. I had really missed the atmosphere and energy I remembered from BuzzFeed’s heyday. But it was clear right off the bat that things had changed a lot. Even before I officially started, there was a round of layoffs. Things felt less freewheeling and more tense. This was the year we unionized, which was so important considering what happened the next year. 2020 is when it really started to get dicey. First Ben announced he was leaving for the Times, right before the Iowa caucuses. That really threw us on the politics team — we were all really angry, not so much at the concept of Ben leaving at all, but that he would check out at the most awkward moment possible. Then obviously the pandemic hit soon after and it was chaos. We fought for the work-share agreement instead of layoffs, and I’m still really proud that the union was able to save those jobs at that time. Even if it didn’t last. My memory of 2021 to 2022 is basically of a place that was struggling to find its footing at all. By the time they offered buyouts last year, I was ready to leave. It wasn’t the same place I had loved so much. Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: I’d always heard that Asian employees at BuzzFeed would get mistaken for one another. Towards the end of 2021 when people started trickling back into the office and traveling to New York for summits with their respective desks, that happened to me, twice, in the span of a week. Two different white men at BuzzFeed News confused me for two different Asian women in our newsroom. Only one apologized! Sam Henig, former executive editor and interim editor-in-chief: When I led the search for a new Editor-in-Chief last year, Karolina [Waclawiak] wrote in her memo that she wanted BuzzFeed News to embrace being “a little chaotic.” She was the perfect person to lead BuzzFeed News into its next chapter, to bring back that fun crazy energy from the early Ben Smith days — the kind of delight that spills onto the page. Given Karolina’s invigorating editorial vision and the strong plan we’d worked on with colleagues across the company to increase and diversify revenue, I left in the fall thinking that some of the best days for BuzzFeed News were still ahead. Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: Near the end, I felt a little like Chicken Little. I was telling everyone at work, “I think something bad’s about to happen.” I have, historically, been right about everything, but I’ll tell you I wasn’t thrilled to be right about this one. The thing that worried me the most was our travel budget disappeared practically overnight. Our earnings reports, now abundantly public, were looking grim. They changed the granola in the office to corn flakes. This, I thought, spells doom. But the tough thing about working in media is that a lot of things are doom-lite, and then the real doom comes and all you can think is: I can’t believe I was right about this. Zia Thompson, audience engagement editor: One Monday in April, our office manager said Wednesday’s lunch would be from a “cutting-edge, robotics-powered mobile pizza restaurant created by a team of former SpaceX engineers.” I normally would’ve stayed home, but I was very intrigued by the idea of robot pizza. That Wednesday, I made the trek to the office and at lunch, I ate a pizza slice so mediocre, that had I not known it was digitally printed, I would’ve guessed it was. The next day, BuzzFeed News shut down. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: There’s actually one thing that my old boss Michael Rusch, who went by “Weed Dude” online, said to me that stuck with me over the years, and was the first thing I thought of when I found out BuzzFeed News was being shut down. He said something to the effect of “I’m asking you to leave your newspaper job to get on a rocket ship. The thing about rocket ships is that they go fast, but the ride can come to an end very unexpectedly. BuzzFeed might last a year, it might last five, it might last a century, we just don’t know.” I really appreciate the poetic foreshadowing of a guy who went by “Weed Dude” online telling me in 2015 that BuzzFeed might abruptly stop like a rocket one day, and then a SpaceX rocket blew up the day BuzzFeed News was getting shut down…. on 4/20/2023. The Investigations desk in the New York office Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: I wasn’t here for the golden years when people were just throwing money around, but I think that spirit of adventure continued even when the purse strings grew tighter and tighter. I went to Charleston for a week just to see if there was an angle to pursue on a topic I was reporting on. Days before I traveled to Michigan to cover the midterm elections, I wrote about an Air Force plane drawing a dick in the sky. You could write the most ridiculous headline and your editor would be like “That’s the one.” Julia Reinstein, senior reporter: I believe that was actually one of three separate stories that three of us wrote about sky dicks. We never let a sky dick go unreported. David Mack, senior reporter: I have never had as much freedom and fun doing anything in my life. In 8.5 years, I never had a single idea rejected. Nothing was off-limits. They sent me to a poppers factory, for fuck’s sake! I wrote a stupid photo story about Trump sitting in a truck on the White House lawn, turned to my editor, Tom Namako, next to me and said, “You have to trust me. You need to publish this.” And he did! It was such a viral hit that the very next day BuzzFeed turned it into a children’s book. And I got a cut. It was nuts. Where else would do that? I still have a few hundred copies under my bed in boxes. I give signed copies to friends when they have kids. I may never have a better job. Matt Berman, former politics editor: My child will not stop crying if I don’t repeatedly read him David’s Trump truck book. Zoe Tillman, former politics reporter: I loved that we had the freedom to write the way we actually talked to each other and to be honest with readers. It built trust. One of my favorite headlines was “There Was Drama At Court Today And Maybe It Involved Mueller’s Investigation But Who Knows.” Tom Warren, investigative reporter: It’s quite reasonable that businesses don’t spend unlimited amounts chasing stories. But for many years BuzzFeed inverted that rule. It meant you were never limited by resource, only by your imagination. We did world-beating investigations that freed people from prison and changed laws. Professionally we won a swath of awards — but the thing I’ll really take with me is that I made friends for life. The experience of working here, whilst sometimes frustrating and often stressful, was a dream come true. The rest of the news business looks insipid and gray in comparison. Clockwise from top: Yemile Bucay, Brandon Wall, Sara Yasin, and Rosalind Adams attend the Committee to Protect Journalists annual International Press Freedom Award reception in 2021.

Megha Rajagopalan, Alison Killing, and Christo Buschek accept the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting at Columbia University in New York City on Jun. 25, 2022. Monica Mark, former West Africa reporter: In April 2015, I got an email from BuzzFeed’s foreign editor Miriam Elder, asking if I’d be interested in talking about what it was like to become part of the World team — “we're all about allowing travel and creativity and a range of stories” is how she described it, which doesn’t even begin to do justice to the wild, creative ride that was the next five years I spent as BuzzFeed News’ first Africa correspondent. I got to cover things no one else was doing at the time, and even some things I haven’t seen anywhere else since. I mean, I have yet to see someone explaining inflation in a West African nation entirely using GIFs. Like everyone else on the amazing World team, I also got to break news that left legacy media eating dust, like on the Special Forces raid gone wrong in Niger. And I got to write longform stories about crazy periods in West African history that wracked up a couple of million — millions! — of views. I just don’t think there’s anywhere else on the internet that political stories about Africa are getting that many eyeballs! Honestly, I still get emotional thinking about what this tiny World desk team achieved in such a short time. Amber Jamieson, internet culture editor: We always treated young people as people, which frankly most publications don’t. After a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, I reached out to some teens who survived and had been posting on Twitter to see if they would meet up for a chat. They said sure, as long as it wasn’t at their school, where a shooting had occurred three days earlier. I said of course not, and we met at a local park. They told me the TV networks told them they could only film an interview in front of the school because their equipment couldn’t move — I knew the network had multiple teams there and it was painfully clear that they just wanted these traumatized teens, who'd never interacted with the media previously, to cry on camera. We always made sure that teens knew they had control over their own story. Claudia Koerner, deputy director breaking news: In the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde school shooting, we sent out a push alert and tweet that the cops had fucked up. It was the truth, everyone was thinking it, but we actually got to say it. Breaking news can be such a punishing job, but that ability to just tell the truth made me proud to do it at BuzzFeed News. Ben King, art director: We had so much leeway to do so many fun and incredibly stupid things, and I really think we did a lot to push both what was possible and expected of an online news outlet. Personally, it was the range of work we did, as well as the absolutely furious pace, that made me love it so much. On a given week, we might be working on a massive investigation, setting up a celebrity photo shoot, designing a map or infographic for a breaking news event, or getting FOIA’d documents from the Mueller investigation at 6:30 p.m. on a Monday and scrambling to get a story up. Maybe one of the best ways I can sum up what we did: One day during the run-up to the 2016 election, Saeed Jones told me he was looking to publish a piece of satire by James Hannaham. The story was written as Trump’s notes to himself for a speech, which (in the way it was submitted) wouldn't really translate very well to our CMS. At the time, we had this kid, Mark Davis, freelancing for us, who had previously worked at Font Bureau as a type designer. He arrives at the office around 10 a.m., and the first thing I said to him was, “Today you’re designing a font based on Donald Trump’s handwriting.” And he did! And we published Hannaham’s piece using that font, then made the font available for anyone to download. It was all terribly stupid, and after Trump won, the joke was significantly less funny. But it was a tremendous experience, and something I can’t imagine any other news outlet doing. Kenneth Bachor, photo editor: BuzzFeed News was a dream job for me. Bouncing ideas off editors and writers at BuzzFeed News was a pleasure because I knew I wasn’t going to be judged — it felt nice to collaborate and feel comfortable, which is sometimes not the easiest feeling to have in a newsroom. We did a feature on male sex dolls and their owners. We had behind-the-scenes access to a sex toy manufacturer in California and assigned photographer Skyler Dahan to spend a day with the male sex dolls — the story was an SPD58 Medal Finalist this year. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: “Punching above our weight” is something I would hear bosses say or I’d see in descriptions of BuzzFeed News. I never saw it that way; I think we punched exactly at our weight. Despite what may have been Ben’s dream, we never competed with the New York Times or legacy outlets; we were always playing an entirely different game. Not better or worse, just different. We succeeded when we looked for stories in places no one else was looking precisely because we couldn’t compete with legacy outlets on the main story of the day. You couldn’t just report The News, you had to be creative, you had to be nimble. I think that’s why so many former BuzzFeed News people have succeeded at big legacy outlets — they have that creativity ingrained in them, plus that institutional power behind them. It’s like, If you thought they were good before, wait till people actually answer their phone calls. Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: It was the only time in the world that I’d worked somewhere with the money to really and truly unleash its talent and resources. I almost hate to name any of them. Tracy Clayton and Heben Nigatu showed what was possible with podcasting. I remember when Quinta Brunson was doing funny little videos for us. Saeed Jones. Albert Samaha and Melissa Segura literally got people freed from prison, among other things. Katie Baker. Ashley Ford. Miriam Elder. Lisa Tozzi. John Stanton. Andrew Kaczynski. Mike Hayes. Katie Notopoulos and Ellie Hall were genius at finding weird stories from the internet and explaining why they mattered offline. Jessica Garrison. I should stop because I’ll be sick about overlooking more folks. I also had a deep appreciation for the folks who excelled at making lists and videos, because I realized that, for a long time, they paid down some of our bills. I’ll forever be grateful about what we built there, and really bummed that it didn’t last. Sarah Mimms, former DC editor: I spent five years at BuzzFeed News and left in 2022 during the previous downsizing, in a decision that broke my heart. It was a real blessing to be covering politics at BuzzFeed News during the Trump presidency; we were a “failing pile of garbage” with a lot of freedom that made a potato version of Sean Spicer and also covered an insurrection and exposed sexual harassment on the Hill — we could do both. I did the best work of my career with brilliant and funny journalists who worked hard and actually bothered to be nice to each other. I met lifelong friends, journalists I deeply admire, and my fiancé all in that newsroom. I don’t expect I’ll work anywhere like it again. Kate Aurthur, former entertainment reporter: As one of the Olds working at BuzzFeed News, I learned so much from my younger colleagues that I’ll take with me forever. I learned how to experiment with my own writing, and to be fearless. And if BuzzFeed News in LA was sometimes treated like an annoying appendage, it was worth it that our second temporary office was at Sunset Gower, and Shonda Rhimes and the cast of Scandal would trudge by every week for their table reads! Ema O’Connor, former politics reporter: I was really trusted as a young person to write incredibly ambitious stories. They took risks like that, they would say, “Yeah, this is a story that needs to be told.” I was able to do what I wanted to do and there was so much freedom. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: We loved news and weren’t snobs. Tom Namako hides under his desk as the newsroom sings happy birthday to him. Sara Yasin, former managing editor: BuzzFeed News was the one place where you could just really and truly write any story, and it was celebrated and treated just as important as a huge investigation. The obsessiveness we put into getting stories right — whether it was Blippi or FinCen Files, we weren’t scared of picking up the weird and wonderful corners of the internet. It’s kind of magical to be a large group that’s on the same wavelength in that way. It’s the most fearless I’ve ever been professionally, because I felt like everyone on staff had each other’s backs even when they didn’t agree. Cody Corrall, audience engagement editor: I was one of a small group of news staffers hired during the pandemic. For the first time in my professional life, I was able to be taken seriously at a national publication while being based in Chicago because of the expansion of remote work (protections which would later be cemented in our union contract). Nobody at BuzzFeed News cared where I went to college or if I worked at a “prestigious” enough job before coming here. There was simply no ego. Expanding access to remote employees just showed how much talent is at our fingertips if we stop honing in on New York and LA as the bastions of “real” journalism: incredible designers, audience editors, and reporters from all over were able to get their foot in the door because of that. Zia Thompson, audience engagement editor: An internet comment section is a notoriously awful place to be, but every now and again, while I’m trudging through the mud, I’ll see people write comments that fill me with so much pride: “Thank you for bringing attention to this.” “Thanks for saying the quiet part out loud.” “This was so interesting and really made me think.” Reading those things, knowing that even just one person found affirmation, meaning, or understanding in what we were doing made it all worth it. This is one of — if not the only — places where we could communicate, both in reporting and in social copy, how normal people talked. We were serious when we needed to be and fun whenever we could be and it just worked. The audience team got to call it like it was and never minced words. To be “the smart friend in your pocket” was our objective and I believe we achieved that. It’s just now hitting me that there probably won’t be another place that will let me make a dick joke about Jeff Bezos’s rocket on TikTok, write thirsty copy for a story about hoochie daddy shorts, or come up with clever punny headlines for the homepage whenever I want, and that makes me sad. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: It’s important to realize how many things in journalism that are now taken for common were pioneered by BuzzFeed News, particularly #TeamNewsApp and News Curation. The way news organizations approached push alerts changed almost overnight with the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and our strategy of sending conversational alerts (that didn’t feel like copy-pastes of headlines! What a concept!) about stories that our readers actually cared about — not what some editor thought was important. We were breaking down complicated stories into visual, bite-size chunks that’s now pretty common all the way back in 2015. We were building direct relations with our readers (we had a BuzzFeed News App Facebook Group!). And as alumni of these teams moved on to other news organizations, our core ideas and approaches spread. It’s easy to forget just how stuffy and boring receiving the news on the internet was in 2014 and 2015. There’s one push alert we did in particular that came the day after the January 6 riots. It had been an extremely an extremely long 24 hours, when Trump suddenly tweeted a video that sure seemed like he was finally conceding the 2020 election. As director, I was very confident in my language, but figured I should probably get somebody else to sign off on saying “bullshit election fraud claims”... shareable culpability and all that. I sent the GOAT Tom Namako two options for the wording. Tom gave no pushback, but did have a very classic Tom Flourish Edit that made the push pop all the more. And so that’s how this went out to the world: Megha Rajagopalan, former investigative reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner: I just basically met Alison Killing, and we decided we were going to do this project — nobody really ever questioned that it had some potential, even though at the outset it must have sounded nuts, like, I’m going to work with an architect and a programmer to find mass internment camps in China. I don’t know that most newsrooms would have let that go. I was at SXSW with Alison, we told Ben Smith about the project, and he was like, “Sounds really cool.” I think it’s probably a function of the level of trust editors put in reporters at BuzzFeed News, which I think would be harder for early and mid-career reporters to gain elsewhere. And then when Mark Schoofs became editor-in-chief, he immediately took an interest in the project and knew that it was going to be meaningful. The day before the Pulitzer was announced, a few of us got an email that BuzzFeed had entered us, and I was like, Oh, OK. I still didn’t think we had a chance, I assumed the FinCEN Files, also from BuzzFeed News, would win. The next day we had a team lunch in London where it did not come up. I went home and basically found out when Mark Schoofs called me and I was like “What??” They were announcing it on a livestream, and I wasn’t watching. My husband was actually watching in the other room, so he found out before me. Anna Betts, reporter: BuzzFeed News was the first-ever newsroom I worked in as a full-time reporter. I was so nervous and had major impostor syndrome as I was going to be working with so many journalists and editors that I had looked up to for so long. As soon as I started in 2022, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone in the newsroom and straight away treated as a part of the BuzzFeed News family. I couldn’t believe the amount of freedom I was given as a new reporter when it came to the stories I got to cover.For four months, I was given the opportunity to solely focus on an investigative story about the cruise industry that I was writing with the legendary Tom Warren, along with the best editing team: Karolina [Waclawiak], Mary Ann [Georgantopoulos], Mark [Yarm] and Jason [Wells]. Working on this project made me a better reporter and cemented my love for journalism and storytelling. I will forever cherish those months working with the dream team on such an impactful piece and embracing the chaos that came with it. Pranav Dixit, tech reporter: I joined BuzzFeed News in 2016 as a correspondent on the Tech desk based in India. We never had an India bureau for News, but my boss, Mat Honan, had the foresight to realize that American tech companies weren’t just changing people’s lives in the US but around the world. BuzzFeed’s tech coverage needed to reflect that. We brought BuzzFeed’s unique brand of tech coverage to India, asking tough questions of American tech companies as they raced to hook a billion Indians coming online for the first time to their products. Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: I believe in nothing, but I always believed in the work we did. Karolina gave me a kind of latitude I never thought I would get as a writer. She was my editor for more than seven years, and in that time, we did so much weird, cool shit: We profiled Lil Pump and Courtney Stodden and Jhumpa Lahiri and Trisha Paytas. We wrote about Trump with the same seriousness that we wrote about Ned from the Try Guys. We wrote reported mega-features on plastic surgery, QAnon, the weight loss industrial complex, and white supremacy. Then, the next day, we’d write about how Friends sucks. Karolina would text me in the middle of the night about some freakish Netflix softcore (using this term lightly) porn film and the next morning I’d be watching it at 8 a.m. and then we’d write something insane and a literal million people would read it. I’m devastated about a lot, but high on my list are all the stories I still wanted to do, that we still wanted to do, that we can’t anymore. Karolina only got a few months as editor-in-chief, and I was excited about the future, how we’d break and reshape conversations about culture and politics and the internet. These stories will live elsewhere, I know, but their conceptions and conceits are a testament to this bizarre, sometimes hectic, sometimes languid, always expansive place. The more I think about the work we did, the more this closure is solidified in my own mind as a mistake. But so it goes: We’re all fuzzy little pappi getting blown off a dandelion stem by a strong breeze. We’ll all land somewhere, and we’ll pollinate anew. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: Thinking about how much range this newsroom had will always stop me in my tracks. The talent! The breadth of reporting! There were no limits to what we’d publish each day, even as our budgets were shrinking. Because we had this massive platform, we had the ability to change the conversation online with any given story on any given day. It was really awe-inspiring to watch things go viral and to be the guiding hand for what everyone was talking about that day because millions of people would read the stories we published. I would come up with outlandish ideas and the writers would be game for it. Writers would come up with wild ideas and I trusted them enough to just go with it. Hitting publish on something was both exhilarating and terrifying — this could change everything or we could be run off the internet. I remember waking up from time to time thinking, How is it that I — and we — get to define what’s important in America? It feels like a fever dream. ● Reported by Katie Notopoulos and Ellie Hall The New York newsroom poses for a photo in 2016. BuzzFeed News",

        "title": "Trans Missouri Residents Affected By Attorney General Order",
        "text": "“I wish people understood that we just want to be able to live our lives. We have as much right to live here as anyone else does.” HuffPost Reporter Protestors rally at against a ban on gender-affirming care in the Missouri Statehouse. When Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey announced an emergency order to restrict gender-affirming care for minors and adults on April 13, AJ Hackworth sent an email to his provider in Springfield to ask about his testosterone prescription. The next day his doctor at CoxHealth told him she would no longer be able to fill prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy. “I do not currently have the processes in place to defend my license to practice gender affirming care should the state investigate me under the new Attorney General emergency rule,” she wrote on April 14. Under the emergency order, which goes into effect on Thursday and runs through February 2024, patients of all ages would have to meet a long list of requirements to prove that they are fit to start or continue gender-affirming care. Even if they’re legally adults, even if they’ve already been accessing this medically necessary healthcare for years, advocates and trans Missourians told BuzzFeed News that the requirements are burdensome, vague, and overly broad. Some fear it will effectively end gender-affirming care in the state entirely — and it’s already causing problems for the people who can least afford to find care elsewhere. Transgender people will have to partake in 15 hourlong therapy sessions over the course of 18 months and prove that any mental health issues — such as anxiety and depression — are resolved prior to receiving treatment for gender dysphoria under the order. The rule also requires patients to have three years’ worth of medical documentation of gender dysphoria and receive a screening for autism, and will force providers to maintain a database of “adverse effects” of gender-affirming care for at least 15 years. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey at the capitol in February 2023. Hackworth, a 34-year-old father of two, said the state’s anti-trans bills and Bailey’s probe into trans health clinics made him fear a moment like this would come and pushed him to prepare for a possible future where his access to hormones was taken away. Out of precaution, he began rationing a portion of testosterone from his monthly vials and has stockpiled half a year's worth of hormones. (If unopened, testosterone has a shelf life of around a year and a half.) “It’s kind of always been in the back of my mind that something like this is probably going to happen,” he told BuzzFeed News. The ACLU of Missouri and Lambda Legal filed a suit on Monday on behalf of two families of young trans people to get a temporary restraining order to block the order from taking effect. “This unprecedented attempt to use Missouri’s consumer protection law to go after necessary and often life-saving healthcare must be stopped. We are honored to stand alongside our courageous plaintiffs in challenging this dangerous and harmful policy. We will defend the rights of transgender people and ensure access to necessary, evidence-based medical care,” Nora Huppert, a staff attorney at Lambda Legal, said in a statement. But hundreds of trans people across the state are still anxiously trying to sort out how to continue receiving gender-affirming care, either in Missouri or a neighboring state. Some are considering moving. As Hackworth’s provider at CoxHealth worked to figure out how to get documentation about his medical history ready to comply with the order, she urged him to get a 90-day supply of hormones to hold him over. However, the process of actually obtaining a three-month supply of hormones can be difficult — especially for patients taking testosterone, which is considered a controlled substance by the federal government. Since Medicaid only covers his testosterone on a monthly basis, Hackworth had to crowdfund to pay for the extra vials out of pocket. Then his pharmacy said he needed a handwritten doctor’s note to explain the bulk prescription. His refill still hasn’t been filled. In Branson, 28-year-old Torin, who asked to be identified by their first name to protect their privacy, was also told by CoxHealth that they couldn’t get their prescription filled on April 14. As of last week, their provider said she would be able to continue prescribing hormones to patients as long as they are “compliant” with the order. But Torin, a parent who has a disability that prevents them from working, said they’re waiting on a letter from a psychiatrist and not sure what other documentation they might need. “If things keep going the way they are, we're going to have to move closer to Springfield... Even that is difficult to do when you're a disabled person, you're on one income, you've got two kids,  both of which are special needs,” Torin told BuzzFeed News. “It sucks, because I really don't want to consider leaving Missouri. All of our family is here. I've lived here my whole life. This is my home, but in the next 10 years if things keep going this way, then I'll probably end up leaving.” Torin worries about the growing anti-trans climate in their town. When Bailey released a tip line for residents to share concerns about gender-affirming care in the state, Torin wondered if their neighbors would sic child protective services on their kids or if they should stop taking hormones altogether to protect themself and their family. (The site has since been taken down after Gen Z’ers spammed it with memes.) “I wish people understood that we just want to be able to live our lives. We have as much right to live here as anyone else does,” they said. For healthcare providers in the state, preparing for the restrictions on gender-affirming care is a flashback to the last days of abortion, which Missouri completely banned last June. Dr. Colleen McNicholas Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said the organization has established care with dozens of new patients, with pop-up clinics in St. Louis, Springfield, and across the Illinois border in Fairview Heights. McNicholas said that on April 17 alone, Planned Parenthood saw 50 new patients and added 200 new appointment slots across its nine healthcare centers in the state. Patients can schedule additional appointments online or over the phone at those health centers. She cautioned that these restrictions will disproportionately affect Black and brown trans people and those in rural areas. “Building back access and equitable health care for folks really needs to center the people who are most impacted and the most marginalized,” she said. The order mirrors  the same tactics Missouri has used to eliminate access to abortion, but McNicholas said she was still surprised by how quickly Bailey was able to set the new restrictions into motion — and how this threatens smaller healthcare organizations that lack the resources and capacity to fight back. “This tactic of increasing administrative burden so substantially and pairing that with the reality that the language in this rule is so devoid of scientific understanding of how we actually practice medicine … makes it very difficult for individual providers to feel comfortable and confident with how they can comply with the rule and provide good quality care to patients,” McNicholas said. Many of the Planned Parenthood appointments were booked within the first few hours, and Stevie Miller, an uninsured nonbinary trans person living in rural Howell County, was able to snag a slot. The 33-year-old who drives for DoorDash was planning to start hormones after he’d paid off his car later this fall. But as soon as he heard about the emergency order, Miller knew he needed to get a prescription on the books no matter what. Last Wednesday, after crowdfunding for his prescription, Miller drove 100 miles, about two hours from his small town, to the Springfield Planned Parenthood. By that evening, he was able to take his first shot, which he filmed and posted on TikTok. “I was so anxious Wednesday, and honestly after the shot I felt so much lighter. I still have the anxiety but it doesn’t feel as crippling,” he said. “That’s the only real thing that is feeling different right now, and it feels good.” Devyn Taylor, a 34-year-old trans woman living in Springfield, is also waiting for her insurance to approve a 90-day supply of estrogen and gathering the documentation to allow her continued hormone replacement therapy, even though she’s been receiving care for a decade. Because of past surgeries, her body no longer produces its own hormones and she fears she could go into early menopause or develop osteoporosis if her prescription is denied. She wishes she could stay focused on the life she’s built in Missouri: her part-time DJ gigs and the garden she hopes to set up with her partner. But instead, the order has forced her to consider the feasibility of staying in the state, or even in the US. “This takes up a lot of mental and emotional real estate. It’d be nice to just live somewhere and not worry about the potential of needing to leave,” she told BuzzFeed News. “It’s hard when you feel like on the immediate horizon you might have to pick up everything and go somewhere. I look forward to that stability if I could just get past this, but I don’t see an easy route to that.” HuffPost Reporter",

        "title": "Fans React To A Bombshell Episode In The Final Season Of \"Succession\"",
        "text": "Warning: contains spoilers, but if you've been on the internet today you already know what happened. BuzzFeed News Reporter Warning: There are a whole lot of spoilers for Season 4, Episode 3 of Succession ahead. In what fans are calling \"one of the best episodes in television history,\" Succession unexpectedly​ killed off its cruel patriarch, Logan Roy, just three episodes into the final season. \"…I think we all…just witnessed…one of the greatest episodes of television ever, \" tweeted critic Matt Neglia. \"Phenomenal acting from everyone across the board.\" this episode of SUCCESSION is going to go down in history as one of the best episodes in modern TV history, the kind that defines what the series has always been about while capturing the raw humanity of the deeply flawed, broken people that are the Roy Family. I’m still reeling. It's pretty much impossible to avoid spoilers at this point. The LA Times and New York Magazine have both released comprehensive obituaries for the fictional character. There was an emotional fog over Twitter the morning after the episode aired. watching my tl watch succession Kendall saying he didn't forgive him, Roman asking did he check his voicemail, Shiv not getting to say goodbye because she was covering for Logan not showing up to his son's wedding, Connor not being looped in on his own father's death.... But first, the actors behind the narcissistic nepo babies of the Roy family showed the wide range of responses children have to the death of an abusive parent. Succession has thus far followed their desperate attempts to earn their father's approval, and with him gone, they will be reckoning with a new reality. The tragedy of SUCCESSION, one of its many, is that Logan Roy raised his children — and led his employees — not to be empowered, nor to succeed him in business, but to take a bullet for him and to be fully incapable of contemplating a world without him. Logan died on a plane ride to Sweden during his eldest son Connor Roy's wedding, skipping the event to secure a business deal. When Connor was informed of his father's passing, he simply said, \"He never even liked me.\" “He never liked me” “I never got to make him proud of me” #succession a day for the memoirs Though Connor set his sights on a long shot presidential run instead of succeeding his father, his three younger siblings were actively trying to wrest power from Logan. Logan's death released an undercurrent of grief that drove Roman, Kendall, and Shiv to cry, tell their dad they love him, and struggle with disbelief. Eventually, they all sprung into action. roman in tonight’s episode Logan's girlfriend-assistant Kerry Castellabate had perhaps the most bizarre reaction of all, giggling and sobbing, looking like she \"caught a foul ball at Yankee Stadium.\" Kerry on the plane Though Succession is technically a drama, each episode offers bursts of humor to propel viewers through the struggle among family members. Following Logan's death, even moments of silliness could not detract from the grief on display. But of course, fans found a way to cut the tension with memes and jokes. Twitter user @waystarroyhoe mistakenly called for Logan's death after the character was particularly cruel at the start of the episode. R to the I P logan on the other end of the line: Logan's death was inevitable in this final season of Succession, but no one saw it coming this early. Still, he was consistently cruel to fan-favorite characters, so some people rejoiced in his demise. succession spoilers //\n.\n.\nlogan roy fancam notice how logan tried to fire gerri and karma immediately came for him they really killed Logan Roy on Easter that man truly was the antichrist #SuccesionHBO all of us watching the episode right now. #Succession #SuccessionHBO But we've still got seven episodes left in the series, in which the titular conflict of the show will be addressed: Who will succeed Logan? BRB, blocking out time to tune in every Sunday night as if I've got a business meeting. BuzzFeed News Reporter",

The world’s second-largest economy has been plunged into a new trade war with the United States, as a flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs has settled in and more are likely to arrive.

March 1, 2025e-Paper Published - February 28, 2025 07:20 pm IST Artworks by Charanjeet Singh Living Temple, a three-day festival celebrating heritage, architecture, and fine arts, began at T-Works in Hyderabad, on Friday. The event spotlights a multidisciplinary art exhibition featuring works by 30 artists from across India. It also includes classical dance performances and workshops on Vedic symbols and Kerala mural painting. Curated by Annapurna Madipadiga of EkChitra and supported by Telangana Tourism, the festival highlights Indian temple architecture, iconography, and the cultural ecosystems fostered by these ancient structures .The art showcase bridges traditional and contemporary expressions. At the entrance, paper sculptures by Vaishali Rastogi Sahni set the tone for the diverse artistic perspectives within. Temple motifs such as the yali, scrolls, and ornamental patterns are reimagined in modern sculptural forms. Titled Embracing the Light and Inner Alchemy, these works invite viewers on a spiritual and artistic journey. A photograph of a Yakshagana artiste by Amar Ramesh\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Photographs by Amar Ramesh spark conversations with their vivid portraits of Yakshagana and Therukoothu artists. His lens captures the intricate carvings of the ‘mandapam’ near the Madurai Meenakshi Temple, while also highlighting the ornate ‘mogappu’ — the carved and painted entrance archways of Chettinad homes. Anil Thambai’s installation, composed of multiple panels, creates the illusion of a journey into the sanctum sanctorum, guiding viewers through a series of arches and pathways. Appam Raghava’s series of Hanuman masks pay homage to popular iconography, while Aryan Patil blends admiration for traditional craftsmanship with a commentary on labour rights and social inequality. His installation, featuring a temple pillar precariously inclined and supported by a working-class figure, serves as a powerful visual metaphor. The Nayakapodu masks of Telangana\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Charanjeet Singh’s art offers a layered commentary on history, architecture, and environmental concerns. He juxtaposes imagery of historic stepwells with vivid depictions of fauna sustained by these water bodies. Drdha Vrata Gorrick, an artist born and raised in the US, takes a more traditional approach. Having spent years researching classical arts in South India, he intricately illustrates stories of Prahlada, Garuda, and Yoga Narasimha through detailed pen and pencil line drawings. Sculpture by Vaishali Rastogi Sahni Photographer Rishi Raj’s images of classical dancers reflect his appreciation for Indian art forms. A trained dancer himself, he has studied kathak, Bharatanatyam, and Bihari folk dance, bringing an insider’s perspective to his visual storytelling. Himanshu Joshi’s mastery in printmaking shines in his mixed media work, Living Temple, which meticulously captures the intricate intersection of sculptures and murals on gopurams. While Jai Khanna takes a traditional approach in depicting Krishna, Janardhan Rao Havanje presents the deity through Kaavi mural art, etching his form on lime and mud. Multidisciplinary artist N. Ramachandran juxtaposes Tanjore paintings with black-and-white imagery of Tamil Nadu’s street life, creating a striking contrast of colour and texture. A standout piece is a series of Nayakapodu masks, traditionally used in Telangana’s folk theatre. Crafted from lightweight poniki wood sourced from the Bhadradri-Kothagudem region, these masks preserve a centuries-old artistic tradition. The exhibition, which opens with bold reinterpretations of temple iconography, fittingly concludes with Vinod Daroz’s sculptures and installations. Using elliptical, nucleus-like forms, the ceramic artist moves beyond conventional imagery while evoking the serene essence of the sanctum.

Arriving at the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, the planeloads of white-clad pilgrims, preparing for the visit to Mecca, follow a distinct route that is largely closed to non-Muslims. In a parallel trajectory, visitors to the airport’s Western Hajj Terminal enter an entirely different world of the Aga Khan award-winning space — of tent-like canopies that lead to a state-of-the-art museum. The ground of Jeddah, deemed holy, allows both these spaces to reflect on the Islamic faith and the extraordinary artefacts it has produced over the centuries. Western Hajj Terminal of Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, venue of the Islamic Arts Biennale.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Marco Cappelletti, courtesy Diriyah Biennale Foundation The second Islamic Arts Biennale, titled And All That Is In Between, is a biennale like no other. In manuscripts, architectural elements, religious symbols like the kiswah which covers the holy Kaaba, arms and armour, and objects of luxury and beauty, an entire world seems to unfold. The exhibition derives its distinction not only from its elegant staging, but also in its unabashedly religious assertion. Historians and scholars note that as compared to western art, the Islamic arts have not received the same degree of critical or theoretical analysis. Perhaps, this series of events, led by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, can initiate a new bout of scholarship. The ‘kiswah’ which covers the holy Kaaba, on display at the Islamic Arts Biennale in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Marco Cappelletti, courtesy Diriyah Biennale Foundation At a time when the Arab world is under pressure to resolve its regional crisis and unitedly resist the U.S.’ intentions for Gaza, the focus on Saudi Arabia is intense. Against a background of human rights concerns and investigations led by western agencies, the current geopolitical crisis casts the kingdom in a new role, as the centre of gravity in the Arab world. As a cosmopolitan enterprise that posits medieval arts with contemporary installations, the biennale marks a clearly articulated ambition within the region. In the last two decades, the Arab world has transformed its profile as a centre for education and the arts. Briolette of India diamond\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Courtesy Symbolic & Chase, London With Julian Raby, the affable former director of the National Museum of Asian Art at the Smithsonian, as lead curator, the biennale inevitably throws up some important questions. Perhaps the principal one is about how Islamic art can be separated from its producers, artisans and makers, who often belong to other faiths and cultures, bringing their own motifs, weaves and colour palettes to use. Nonetheless, the exhibition marks a breathtaking view of artefacts loaned from over 30 institutions, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Vatican Apostolic Library and the Louvre, presented in state-of-the-art vitrines and lighting that would be the envy of any world museum. ‘Melon Mahallah’ by the Berlin-based Slavs and Tatars.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Marco Cappelletti, courtesy Diriyah Biennale Foundation The exhibition itself, with open and closed spaces, engages the mind and the eye with its dazzling display. Amin Jaffer, one of the biennale’s artistic directors and director also of the Al Thani Collection, creates one of the highlights in a section titled ‘Al Mukhtani’, that features precious objects from Qatar’s ruling family. A Mughal ruby-encrusted water sprinkler, engraved spinels and huge emeralds, a plate depicting life on the Nile from the 8th century, the early decades of the Muslim calendar, and gold coins from Byzantium are some of the precious objects on view. The fabulous Briolette of India diamond that weighs 90 carats (believed to have been acquired by Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine in the 12th century, making it the oldest diamond in the world), royal robes and Mughal paintings by masters of Jahangir’s atelier all enrich this viewing. Mughal ruby-encrusted water sprinkler from The Al Thani Collection. An unusual section named ‘Al Madar’ or the Orbit takes a sweeping view of the science of heavenly constellations, and analyses the genius of mathematics and its uses in astronomy. Curated by Abdul Rahman Azzam, it introduces the astrolabe (al-asturb in Arabic) that helped calculate the movement of stars and navigate ship voyages. One of the finest, most integrated aspects of the exhibition is that ‘Al Madar’ is heavily textual, and draws from the approximately 3,500 Arabic manuscripts in the collection of the Vatican Apostolic Archive, among other sources. The handwritten books on view demonstrate how the zero, invented in India by Aryabhatta, travelled to the Arab world, finally to be employed by Fibonacci, the most talented mathematician of his time. At the heart of the exhibition are the centres of Mecca and Medina, to which a pavilion each has been dedicated, and also the material presence of the Quran. The House of God as a symbol and presence has manifold representations in the show. There is on view the key to the Kaaba — from the time of the Prophet, this has been given to the Bani Shaiba family, who have historically served as gatekeepers to the holy site. Two interesting contemporary insertions making use of Islamic symbols include Asif Khan’s Glass Quran, a highly delicate sculpture composed of 604 inscribed glass pieces placed one upon the other, rendering the holy book iconic. The various copies of the Quran on view represent an extraordinary variety of calligraphic styles and texts, and reaffirm how the holy book has time and again served as an inspiration for art. ‘Magnetism’ by Ahmed Mater There is also the evocative work Magnetism by Ahmed Mater, which uses the simplicity of the Kaaba as a miniature black cube. As it rotates slowly, its magnetic field sets into vibration thousands of small black iron particles, placed in circles, to suggest the movement of pilgrims during the Hajj. The copies of the Quran on view represent an extraordinary variety of calligraphic styles and texts, and reaffirm how the holy book has time and again served as an inspiration for art. The largest Quran, believed to have been a gift from the Nawab of Rampur in the 1850s, stands in contrast to the ones produced in variations of the principle five calligraphic styles in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. The Sufi painterly trope of bringing cross-generational holy men in conversation is wonderfully illustrated in works like Prince Murad Baksh with Holy Men and Attendants, painted by Govardhan, from the Al Thani collection. A careful calculus of the exhibits reveals a fine confluence of aesthetics and knowledge. Different figures from the Islamic world come to light, such as the influential 10th-century Persian astronomer, Abd al-Rahman. Other displays of interest include signs of the Arabic constellations, or the globe made by Mohd. Asturlabi Humayun Lahuri in Mughal India in 1639, which dispel the western hegemony over alchemy, science and mathematics.

From the subcontinent, Mohd. Imran Qureshi creates a space for rest with hundreds of Pakistani woven mats, called Zubaida’s Trail, after the Abbasid queen who built a rest-house for pilgrims travelling between Kufa and Mecca, more than a thousand years ago. Works by Indian artists can be found in the ‘Al Midhallah’ or the Canopy, that invokes the Islamic garden as a tented roof-like structure. Another important artefact, from the ‘Al Bidayah’ (The Beginning) section, is a madraj or staircase with Baroque motifs, sent by the Nawab of Arcot Azam Jah Bahadur from Chepauk in Chennai to Mecca in the early 19th century. A staircase from Chennai, presented to Mecca by the Nawab of Arcot in the early 19th century. This biennale owes its significance not only to the wonder and antiquity of the objects on display or the sophistication of the installations. Even as it affirms a new category of the religious within the biennale circuit, it offers a novel paradigm for the reading and exhibiting of art, and speaks of newer power equations within the art world. Islamic Arts Biennale 2025 is on till May 25. The art critic and curator is based in New Delhi.

In the 80 years since its inception, the Institute has always drawn visitors, courtesy its huge library, performance hall and serene surroundings. “An interesting addition has been the art gallery within the premises. Artists now have a chance to display their work within a space that boasts an old world charm, complete with red oxide flooring and timber rafters on the high ceiling. IIWC is housed in an acre of land,” says Arakali Venkatesh, Secretary, IIWC. According to Arakali, BP Wadia set up IIWC in Bengaluru to cater to students of Theosophy, who volunteered their time and energy for the cause of universal brotherhood through art and culture — a duty they considered paramount. Wadia’s involvement was awe-inspiring.  “Back then, Bangaloreans would quip that if North Bengaluru had the Tata Institute (IISc), the South had the Wadia Institute,” Arakali says, adding IIWC has long run on a strong volunteer base. The art gallery at the Indian Institute of World Culture in Bengaluru. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Visitors to IIWC find it quite relaxing to visit this INTACH-listed heritage building, housed in a tranquil location, just a stone’s throw from Lalbagh and Krishna Rao Park. The proximity to old Bengaluru shopping localities such as Gandhi Bazaar and Chamarajapete as well as an abundance of restaurants, make it a favoured destination, to say nothing of IIWC’s convenient parking space within the premises. Bahmanji Pestonji Wadia, born in 1881 in erstwhile Bombay, was the eldest son of Pestonji Cursetji Wadia and Mithabai. Belonging to a family of shipbuilders from a village in Surat, young Wadia joined the family textile business after matriculation, going on to take over following his father’s demise. In 1904, Wadia sold the flourishing textile venture and became involved with the philosophy of the Theosophical Society founded by Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott. Over the years, he resolved to devote his life to sharing Theosophy and even moved to Madras in 1908 where he managed the Theosophical Publishing House working under Annie Besant. In the following decade he turned a prolific author with over 30 titles to his credit. IIWC was established in Bengaluru on August 11, 1945, by Wadia and his Columbian wife Sophia Wadia, “to make available those nuggets of knowledge that make people noble, and self-sacrificing in spirit.” What made it easier for Wadia’s vision of IIWC take off in the city, was his earlier brush with Home Rule Movement where his interactions with literary and political bigwigs helped him garner people and funds. “Public lectures from political leaders, Nobel laureates, scholars, scientists and public representatives, as well as music and dance performances from leading artistes were arranged every week. Books from various fields were housed over the years in the library to make it a comprehensive cosmopolitan movement,” says Arakali. The library at the Indian Institute of World Culture in Bengaluru. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Nonagenarian, and former Chief Justice MN Venkatachaliah, Chairman Advisory Committee IIWC, says it was clear from its inception that the institute was an academy not only for scholars, but also a platform to promote art and culture, with litterateurs, educationists and statesmen sharing their views in the creation of value systems. “Opportunities were created for global events, academic discussions, cultural evenings, and for accessing the best books — as part of the “hallmarks of Humanism” that Wadia insisted on. The institute got its lecture and performance hall, and public library through Wadia’s contributions and donations from philanthropists and the public. “The Wadia couple respected local culture, integrating themselves with their thought processes and in their style of dressing too,” says Venkatachalaiah. A note in the coffee table book brought out by IIWC during its Platinum Jubilee in 2020 states that the institute made rapid strides much before Independence due to Wadia’s foresight, for nearly 14 years before his death in 1958, and his ability to connect with leaders from various fields across the world and in India. The library was started in 1945, and included 2,000 of Wadia’s own books. A generous donation of 3,000 books by the then Vice-President of IIWC, Sister Sophia TenBroeck in 1957, was a major breakthrough. A huge collection of rare and valuable classics with a permanent endowment, was donated in 1963 by a distinguished physician from France, Dr KT Behenan, who was a World War II veteran and had made Bengaluru his home. This gesture strengthened the endeavour, and with people’s generosity over the years, the library now boasts over one lakh titles across genres such as fiction, biographies, travelogues, religion, philosophy, sports and science, making it a large public-use library. The magazine section boasts some of the rarest collections of Chandamama from the 1940s to the oldest Tintin series as well as Tinkle, Champaka, Indrajal and Bombemane. Educational books are sold for a minimum price during book fairs every year, and nearly 120 titles have been published by the IIWC itself. IIWC collaborates with organisations such as IGNCA, BIC, Mythic Society, Lalithakala Academy and the ICCR, to host exhibitions on photography, painting and sculpture\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special arrangement Vidushi TS Sathyavathi, president of IIWC, who is also a vocalist and Sanskrit scholar, says lecture series and performing arts flow simultaneously like a serene river at IIWC, with nearly 300 programs rolling out each year. Partnering with NFDC, Suchitra Film Society and the Bangalore Film Society, they screen films from across the world. IIWC also collaborates with organisations such as IGNCA, BIC, Mythic Society, Lalithakala Academy and the ICCR, to host exhibitions on photography, painting and sculpture. “Going forward, we plan to curate more art forms from Indian and global streams, making them relevant to the contemporary cultural milieu. Any institution disseminating culture should not be in an existential angst; we plan to be pertinent to the times in culture, arts, music and literature,” says Vidushi.

Entries from Sister Sophia TenBroeck’s diary are a record of several talks and events. She notes how IIWC would see uncontrolled crowds surging in even during pre-Independent days, especially during the participation of distinguished speakers, despite the provision of loudspeakers in the nearby gardens. Halls, corridors and free spaces outside have been packed during talks by Governor General C Rajagopalachari, Presidents S  Radhakrishnan and VV Giri, litterateurs DV Gundappa and Masti Venkatesha Iyengar and others. IIWC has also hosted the likes of sitarist Ravi Shankar, Mysore Royal, Jayachamajaja Wadiyar, American activist Martin Luther King Jr, Tibetan spiritual leader Panchen Lama and 19 Nobel laureates, including Julian Huxley and CV Raman. It is said Wadia had insisted, “Our idea is to have open-to-public programmes for inclusive participation; no restriction in admission rules shall prevail,” when a re-consideration on entry rules was suggested. The Indian Institute of World Culture was a popular cultural space in south Bengaluru for hosting talks and events. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Published - February 25, 2025 12:49 pm IST The Hindu MetroPlus\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bangalore\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        culture (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        arts, culture and entertainment Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

From ancient civilisations that have shone light upon inking tools to well-preserved ancient mummies with symbols tattooed, the history of tattoos goes beyond geographical borders, cultures, and generations. In the modern era, tattoos often symbolise a story, a liking towards a design, or sometimes a cultural tradition. However, stepping back in time, tattoos are believed to have had a much deeper meaning to represent status, hierarchies, and even careers. They are also believed to have had therapeutic purposes rather than mere decoration on one’s skin. A typical example of the same is the earliest known evidence of tattoos to date—the tattoos of Ötzi the Iceman. In September 1991, two German tourists, Helmut and Erika Simon, stumbled upon a body half-frozen in ice in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border. After multiple trials, the body was salvaged and examined. The examination revealed that the human remains are of an individual who died more than 4000 years ago. This natural mummy was named Ötzi the Iceman and, much later, was found to be close to 5,300 years old. A reconstructed sculpture of Ötzi.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Flickr His body had more than 60 tattoos, primarily consisting of simple dots and lines. It is believed that they might have been created for therapeutic purposes due to their positions near joints and the back. These findings also suggest that tattooing was practiced in prehistoric societies possibly for medical or mystical reasons. Close-up of the reconstructed sculpture of Ötzi.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Flickr Apart from Ötzi, ancient Egyptian mummies, some dating back to 2000 BCE, have also been discovered with tattoos. These tattoos often depicted religious symbols and protective motifs as well as hinting at spiritual, social, and medicinal significance to the art. By the 19th and early 20th centuries, tattoos began to be popular in the West, and the invention of the electric tattoo machine in the 1890s revolutionised tattooing, making it more accessible and efficient.

February 22, 2025e-Paper Published - February 21, 2025 03:02 pm IST Otherside is for the connoisseur and the everyday premium whiskey drinker\n                                          | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement In 2020, when Stranger & Sons gin took home a Gold Outstanding medal at the annual International Wine & Spirit Competition (IWSC) in London, it was clear that Indian spirits were no longer on the sidelines. The so-called ‘gin revolution’ had arrived, and with it, a shift in how Indian spirits were perceived both at home and abroad. ‘Premiumisation’ became the buzzword, and suddenly, consumers were not just drinking — they were exploring, curating, and investing in their bottles. Now, a few years down the line, another shift is underway. And this time, it is whiskey’s turn. Third Eye Distillery, the name behind Stranger & Sons, is now turning its attention to the behemoth that is India’s whiskey market with the launch of Otherside Subcontinental Whiskey — a homegrown blend that embraces India’s tropical extremes. The whiskey is blended in ex-bourbon barrels using a Solera process\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement Whiskey in India is a serious business. The country is the largest consumer of the spirit in the world, with a market that skews heavily towards Scotch and Scotch-inspired blends. According to Statista, in 2025, India’s whisky market is projected to generate approximately US$17.5 billion (₹1.5155 trillion) in revenue from at-home consumption, with an expected volume of 3.2 billion litres. But as Rahul Mehra, CEO and co-founder of Third Eye Distillery, points out, there is a gap in the market — one that mirrors the gin scene from a few years ago. “The whiskey space in India is still dominated by Scotch or products that mimic Scotch. There hasn’t been a true embrace of what India, with its unique climate and geography, can bring to the table.” Past and present India’s whiskey story has long been tied to imported Scotch, a colonial hangover that still influences drinking habits today. The early decades post-independence saw the rise of mass-produced, molasses-based whiskeys — technically rums — masquerading as whiskey. The premium whiskey space remained largely untouched by Indian players, save for a few outliers like Amrut, Paul John, and Rampur, which put Indian single malts on the global map. But the blended whiskey space, the everyday pour, remained largely uninspired. Consumers either reached for familiar international names or settled for local blends that played it safe. Otherside, however, is looking to change that. Born in the tropics Aged across India’s diverse climates and distilled in Goa, Otherside embraces the heat, monsoons, and shifting seasons that influence maturation in ways colder climates never could. “Scotland set the rules, but they don’t apply here,” Rahul explains. “A whiskey that takes 12 years to age there develops in just four to five years in India. The interaction with the wood, the climate-driven maturation — this is something uniquely Indian, and we should own it.” Unlike Scotch, which adheres to strict regional and production rules, Otherside is defining its own space. It is a blended Indian whiskey aged entirely in India, finished in charred ex-bourbon barrels using a Solera process that layers depth and complexity. Otherside is, in short, complex yet approachable\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement “We’re not trying to make an ‘Indian Scotch.’ We’re making an Indian whiskey that truly represents where it’s from.” So, what does Otherside actually taste like? In short: Complex yet approachable. “There’s an unmistakable sense of land and sea breeze, the kind of air you smell when you’re on a beach,” Rahul says. “A little hint of smoke, a depth that makes it feel like a complete whiskey.” This balance, he notes, comes from the malts used, the ageing process, and the environment in which it matures. The result? A whiskey suited for everyday drinking, occasional sipping, and even cocktails. “We drink like this, so we’re putting out a whiskey that fits into how we actually drink.” Changing perceptions, one sip at a time While Indian single malts have gained recognition, blended Indian whiskeys still face perception challenges. Premium Indian blends are often dismissed in favour of Scotch, despite India’s massive consumption numbers. But consumer habits are evolving. With the rise of homegrown craft spirits, there is a growing appetite for authenticity — products that reflect their provenance rather than imitate foreign benchmarks. Much like how American whiskey carved its own path instead of mimicking Scotch, India’s whiskey industry is at a crossroads. The question is no longer whether India can make great whiskey, but whether it can create an identity of its own. With Otherside, Third Eye Distillery is betting on the latter. “We were bored of what was happening in India,” Rahul admits. “The experiential side of drinking was missing. People were being sold whiskey based on where it was from, not what it actually tasted like. That didn’t excite us as consumers, so we decided to change that.” Looking ahead Otherside launches first in Goa and Mumbai, followed by Haryana and Karnataka. The idea also is to shift the narrative. “Not all whiskey drinkers play chess,” Rahul jokes, referencing the old-school imagery that often surrounds the drink. “It’s time to take whiskey outdoors, to break free from stiff traditions and just have fun with it.” The challenge now is to get ‘liquid to lips’ — to let consumers experience something different and see if it resonates. If the gin revolution was anything to go by, Indian whiskey might just be the next big thing.

February 21, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 21, 2025 03:34 pm IST There is a common language that everyone speaks, and then there is your own language — the one that feels like home. It’s the language of family, comfort, and belonging. Even when you’re far from home, hearing it can instantly make you feel at ease. That’s the power of a mother tongue. It’s more than just words; it carries emotions, traditions, and identity. Just as we use it to connect with our loved ones, our local languages connect us to our roots. But what happens when these voices start to fade? Observed on February 21, International Mother Language Day reminds us of the need to preserve linguistic diversity and protect fading languages. India is home to one of the most linguistically diverse populations in the world, with over 19,500 languages and dialects spoken across the country. This incredible variety reflects the country’s rich history, cultural complexity, and unique identities of its many communities. However, despite this linguistic richness, India’s lesser-known languages are under threat, with many of them fading into oblivion. Ancient languages: Tamil, one of the oldest surviving languages in India, has a history of over 5,000 years. It’s a key part of South India’s linguistic and cultural heritage. Widely spoken languages: Hindi, as the most spoken language in India, serves as a bridge across diverse regions, being an Indo-Aryan language linked to Sanskrit and many European languages. While languages like Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, and Marathi flourish, many lesser-known languages are fading away. Several endangered languages across India have small speaker populations: Other endangered languages include: A phonetic class at Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore. (CIRCA 1994) The lost language of Arwi: A fusion of Tamil and Arabic Arwi, also known as Arabic Tamil, is a unique language that evolved through the interaction of Tamil and Arabic speakers along the southern coasts of India. Originating in the 8th Century, Arwi emerged as a result of trade and travel by Arab merchants, who brought Arabic to Tamil-speaking regions. Over time, the two languages intertwined, creating a new dialect written in an Arabic-based script, but with words and meanings borrowed from Tamil. With the arrival of European powers and the rise of English, Arwi declined and is now considered endangered. Example: Amal: An Arabic word that means “deed” that is used in the Tamil language to mean “implementation” Where to see Arwi in Chennai: Arwi can be seen on old tombstones in places like the Jumma Pali Masjid in Kilakarai, located about 530 km south of Chennai. Additionally, the script is found at Pulicat Lake, approximately 55 km from Chennai. Pulicat was once a major port city, where tombstones bearing Arwi inscriptions can still be found today, reflecting the historical presence of Arab traders in the region. Janki Nawale, a linguist specialising in language technology for low-resource Indian languages at AI4Bharat, shares her insights on the role of AI in preserving and revitalising India’s vanishing voices. Her work focuses on creating and curating human-supervised training datasets for machine translation and speech recognition models. She highlights the challenges of linguistic diversity, data collection, and cultural sensitivity while emphasising the need for collaboration between technology, local communities, and education. Through AI4Bharat, she and her team are building open-source tools and datasets to support and sustain India’s diverse linguistic heritage. With many Indian languages being classified as low-resource, how do you see AI playing a role in preserving and revitalizing these vanishing voices? Preserving low-resource languages — or any language — is a challenging task due to factors like linguistic diversity, high costs, lack of standardized scripts, scarcity of text data, and the limited availability or willingness of native speakers. At AI4Bharat, we have laid the foundation for creating and curating speech and text data for Indian languages, including low-resource ones like Bodo, Santali, and Kashmiri.\nThe key to effective preservation lies in strong collaboration between technological advancements, local communities, domain experts, and most importantly, language specialists. To support this, AI4Bharat has open-sourced tools, speech and text datasets, as well as machine translation, speech recognition, and text-to-speech models in 22 Indian languages—freely accessible to researchers, industries, and native speakers.\nOur data collection frameworks and tools are designed to be reusable across multiple languages. One of our proudest achievements is IndicVoices, a dataset of natural and spontaneous speech comprising 16,347 hours of read (8%), extempore (76%), and conversational (15%) audio from 25,000 speakers across 308 Indian districts and 22 languages. This initiative is ongoing, with a goal of expanding to over 400 districts. Linguistic Diversity and Loss: India is a global “language hotspot,” characterised by high linguistic diversity, endangerment, and low documentation. Between 1961 and 1971, the Indian census saw a drastic reduction in recognised mother tongues, from 1,652 to just 109. One study estimates that approximately 220 languages have been lost in India over the years. The People’s Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI), in a survey conducted from 2010-2013, documented 780 languages and 68 scripts, yet estimates that around 100 languages may have gone undocumented due to remoteness or conflict. “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”Nelson MandelaActivist and former President of South Africa Endangered language communities: Languages spoken by remote communities, particularly in the Northeast and the Andaman Islands, are identified as the most vulnerable. The Great Andamanese language family, for example, has seen the extinction of several of its languages in recent years, with the deaths of the last fluent speakers. Similarly, the Rai-Rokdung language in Sikkim, with a community of only around 200 people, faces significant endangerment due to assimilation and lack of intergenerational transmission. The Tangsa community in Arunachal Pradesh, with approximately 100,000 people divided into 40 sub-tribes, also faces challenges in preserving its various dialects. Great Andamanese The Tangsa traditional folk dancers of Arunachal Pradesh are in head gear dancing with the tune of Nagara (drums) Preservation efforts: Various initiatives are working to document and revitalise endangered Indian languages. Projects like PLSI’s linguistic profiles, Sikkim University’s Sidhela archive, and community-led efforts — such as developing scripts and integrating them into curricula — play a crucial role. Government schemes like SPPEL also support documentation and preservation Bubble chart showing presence of languages of Indian filmi songs on Wikidata. Despite India’s linguistic richness, many languages are slowly fading away. The reasons are complex: What are some of the biggest challenges in developing unbiased language models for Indic languages, especially when accounting for social and linguistic diversity? Creating unbiased language models and datasets for a landscape like India was a lesson in adaptability, trust-building, and linguistic inclusivity. From Kashmir’s winter to Bodoland’s remote villages, every challenge reinforced the importance of context-aware data collection. In India, one-size-fits-all never works—only constant learning does. Making sure the framework is so detailed that even a 60 years old farmer in Assam finds it interesting to participate is what we did differently. The data is not just speech collected but stories, opinions, voices of thousands of people across the country Challenges: Building trust in data collection: Clear communication and trust-building were essential to ensure participation, especially in rural and remote areas. Mobilizing participants was harder than expected due to skepticism around data privacy concerns but we made sure the whole process is followed with ethical guidelines and consent. Tailoring data collection methods: Initial assumptions failed in rural areas, where urban-centric prompts were irrelevant. Adjusting prompts to local contexts improved engagement. coordinators were necessary to help participants feel comfortable speaking naturally, overcoming initial reluctance. Inclusion of senior citizens and rural women: Engaging elderly participants and shy women was a challenge, but they became invaluable contributors when they saw the project as a way to preserve linguistic heritage, especially in regions like Manipur, Kashmir, Bodoland. Adapting to regional challenges: Extreme weather conditions (harsh winters in Kashmir, monsoons in Kerala, heat waves in West Bengal) affected operations, highlighting the need for flexible data collection strategies. Urban vs. Rural divide: While rural participants faced infrastructure challenges (poor internet, lack of quiet spaces), urban professionals were often indifferent, requiring innovative mobilization strategies.Recording in noisy urban settings increased logistical complexities and costs. Linguistic and cultural sensitivity: The project underscored the vast linguistic and cultural diversity in India, requiring region-specific strategies for effective data collection. School girl in classroom, Rajasthan. Despite the rapid digital advancements and shifting linguistic preferences, preserving and nurturing native languages remains crucial. Language is more than just a means of communication; it carries culture, history, and identity. While technology can help document and archive languages, true preservation lies in active engagement and daily use. Janki highlights the importance of moving beyond the idea of glorifying a single language or enforcing a standardised version. Instead, she emphasises that “each language should be perceived as a unique way of communication without being hierarchical.” She believes that exposure from an early age is key, stating that “educational institutions and parents can ensure that children grow up listening to stories and songs in their mother tongue. Learning to read and speak in one’s native language will not hinder the process of learning English; in fact, it will enhance it.” In India, where linguistic diversity is deeply woven into traditions, languages have survived through oral storytelling, folk songs, and literature. However, as globalisation influences linguistic choices, concerns about the survival of lesser-spoken languages remain. Janki argues that rather than focusing on linguistic purity, the effort should be on making languages thrive: “Rather than purifying a language, we should preserve it in its most vibrant form — creating quality content, reading and writing stories, studying it in schools, translating content, and embracing all its colloquial variations. Ultimately, language preservation is not just about safeguarding words; it is about keeping cultures alive, ensuring that future generations inherit not only the vocabulary but also the stories, emotions, and expressions that define their heritage.

In the Purananuru, 15 women poets have sung 57 verses. Seven of these have also composed verses in the Agananuru,” shares Sarala Rajagopalan, Tamil litterateur. She was recently awarded the Amma Ilakkiya Virudhu for the year 2023, by the Tamil Nadu government. Sarala owes her interest in Tamil literature to her brother, who used to borrow books for her from libraries. She decided early on that she would major in Tamil. Because of her sympathy for the feminist cause, she chose ‘Feminism in Sangam literature’ as the subject of her thesis. Her engagement with feminist thoughts made her a fan of later writers such as Vedanayagam Pillai, Bharati, Thiru Vi Ka and Bharatidasan. “In the Sangam age, a woman had the freedom to choose the man she wanted to marry. Women were bold enough to stand up to power. Avvaiyar served as King Adhiyaman’s messenger to King Thondaiman. Venni Kuyathiyar boldly told Karikalan that the Chera king was a much better man  than Karikalan,” she adds. Sarala draws extensively from the past to show how progressive the thinking was. “Vedanayagam Pillai was the first person to emphasise that education for women was a must. He wrote a book titled Penn Kalvi. In his novel Sugunasundari, the heroine is as educated as the hero. Pillai wrote kirtanais stressing the importance of women’s education. In one of them, the women tell the men: Viththayai padippiyungal (give us education). Bharatidasan said that as long as women remained shackled, freedom for the country would remain a distant dream\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement In the magazine Chakravarthini, Bharati wrote that there were only three ways in which the status of women could be improved — education, education and education.  Bharatidasan said that as long as women were denied freedom of speech and remained shackled, freedom for the country would remain a distant dream,” she says. Vedanayagam Pillai said that proverbs demeaning women should not be used. Sarala, cites  a few examples. ‘Penn sirithaal pochu’: a woman’s smile is disastrous! Another suggests a woman’s smile would give a man the idea that she is ready for physical intimacy. There is one that says that a tree that bears no fruit and a woman with no children burden the earth. There are proverbs that convey the idea that men bond together easily, but if a few women get together, a quarrel is in the offing. Sarala says Sangam literature abounds in similes. One of the similes says that just as Bhima took his family to safety when Duryodhana set fire to the lac palace, so does an elephant guide its herd to safety when a forest fire breaks out. “Reading Tamil literature helps glean historical information too,” says Sarala. “We learn about kings such as Adhiyaman Anji, Aruman, Azhici, Ahkuthai, Ori, Nalli, Nannan, Paari, Poraiyan and Malayaman Irumudikkari. Poet Paranar describes Cheran Senguttuvan’s victory over the Kadamba kings. The Silappadikaram also talks of his military expeditions in North India. We learn about towns, cities, mercantile settlements and hills. We come across the names of Kurumbur, Kundrur, Puzhinadu, Arkaadu, Paatali, Maandai, Kaveripoompattinam, Thondi, Urandai, Kollimalai and so on.” Has she studied Tamil folk songs? “Of course. I even wrote a book Malayaruvi - Oru Paarvai, in which I analysed Ki Va Ja’s book on folk songs. You find folk songs even in Tamil epics. “In Civaka Chintamani, a woman sings a verse that is part oppari (lament) and part thalattu (lullaby) when she delivers a baby even as her husband dies.  We find the influence of folk in religious literature too. For example, Kulasekara Azhwar’s ten verses beginning with mannu pugazh are thalattu verses.” Tamil poet Kannadasan\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu Archives Does she read modern literature? “I don’t read novels or short stories. But I do enjoy modern poetry.  Tamizh Oli’s narrative poem Veerayi is one that I like very much.It reflects his Communist sympathies. Kannadasan’s Attanathi-Adhimandi is another narrative poem that I like. It is based on the love story of Attanathi and Adimandhi, which we find in Sangam literature. Attanathi is actually Attan Athi, Attan being a prefix he acquired because he was a good dancer and dance teacher. The MGR film Mannadhi Mannan was based on Kannadasan’s poem,” says Sarala, a retired Professor of Tamil from Queen Mary’s college. She has written more than 100 books, has participated in more than 150 seminars and has won 66 awards.

February 20, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 20, 2025 10:38 am IST Readers queueing up before a mobile library van in Bangalore on April 27, 1987. \n                                          | Photo Credit: T. L. Prabhakar Libraries have existed around the world for centuries. When I was in around third grade, I stumbled upon something new and exciting as a bookworm and a travelling enthusiast. A ship. And not just any ship, a ship called Logos Hope. What’s special about this fleet, you may ask? For an eight-year-old who adored books, to go inside a ship for the first time and find it filled with books in every corner was heavenly. It was the first time I had been introduced to the concept of a moving library, and with time I learnt how revolutionary it was in a developing country. The Hindu Lit for Life mobile library in Chennai.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Raghunathan SR Before the invention of technology and the Internet, a major method to pass on knowledge was through books and writing. Accessibility to this knowledge was mainly through educational institutes and, more importantly, public libraries. Earlier, traditional libraries used to be situated much more in developed areas of the country, inevitably affecting the accessibility of the same. With social issues like untouchability and inequality haunting every nook and cranny, it was more than often the marginalised communities that were on the receiving end of this inaccessibility. To bridge this gap, the concept of “moving libraries” emerged in India. These libraries on wheels bring books and educational resources to people who may not have access to traditional libraries due to geographical, social, or economic barriers. Such moving libraries, popularly called mobile libraries, cater to rural and street populations, ensuring that books and learning are not confined to urban centres. The concept of mobile libraries is not new; it has existed globally for centuries in different forms, including book carts, travelling librarians, and postal book services. The first moving library in India was perhaps the bullock cart filled with books going around Melavasal, a village near Mannargudi in Tamil Nadu, in 1931. An initiative to ensure people in deep rural areas of India have access to books was the brainchild of Rao Bahadur S.V. Kanagasabai Pillai, a Mannargudi-based engineer. The first mobile library of India near Mannargudi in Tamil Nadu, in 1931.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu Archives While imparting education to those who could not access the same in schools and other institutions, Pillai had initiated classes in various villages through which hundreds learnt how to read and write in Tamil. Started as a social work endeavour, Pillai soon realised that even after learning how to read and write, most of the rural villages did not have access to books or papers to improve upon the same. This inspired him to create a mobile library with whatever books he could collect and a bullock designed to store the same. The books mainly dealt with vocational skill improvement books for farmers and other villagers with tips about gardening, farming, and various other cottage industries. Soon several other books, including fables and parables, also joined the collection. Close to a hundred villages were toured by this moving library, ensuring that thousands could borrow the books of their choice until the cart came along in its next round of touring. As times changed and gramophones became popular, records were also taken in the cart along with a gramophone to engage more with the villagers. The idea gained more traction in India during the mid-20th century when literacy campaigns and educational reforms grew stronger, and people recognised the need to make books more available. Thus began the evolution of India’s moving libraries. Through bullock carts, autorickshaws, vans, cycles, animal backs, boats, and whatnot. This revolutionary idea has grown much stronger in the past years, and soon libraries around the country started having a mobile library to ensure better reachability. ‘Adhar’, the library fitted onto a camel cart, ready for rounds in Bassi village of Jaipur district in Rajasthan.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                The Hindu Archives With the transportation industry flourishing over the years, moving libraries started having more avenues to explore. From bullock carts and cycles, it started to transform buses, vans, and boats into libraries for the wider population to access. Over the years, they evolved by incorporating technology and digital resources to improve their impact. Here are a few unique libraries around the country that are on the move. The Delhi Public Library was among one of the first institutions to introduce mobile library vans in 1957. This initiative inspired other states and organisations to launch similar projects. In Tamil Nadu, a cycle library is being run by an NGO, Dulkal, while Maharashtra has multiple initiatives like a walking library to vans and bullock carts. In areas connected by waterways like West Bengal and Kerala, houseboats have been converted into libraries. The Young Readers’ Boat Library in Kolkata is known to be India’s first boat library and offers a variety of books in English, Hindi, and Bengali, as well as activities like storytelling and book launches. There is also a tram-converted library in Kolkata, which has evolved with time to provide WiFi access for readers who want to avail e-books. The Stories Library Cafe van in Chennai.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Velankanni Raj B While coastal states converted boats into libraries, desert communities in Rajasthan have improvised and brought in the concept of camel libraries. In Rajasthan’s Jodhpur, children folk around the makeshift camel library as it travels through the rural villages across the deserts. Buses converted into libraries are one of the most common formats of mobile libraries in India. In places like Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and rural areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka, bus libraries are one of the easy options to avail when it comes to getting books. With time, a lot of libraries are becoming quiet corridors with filled bookshelves. Initiatives that promote doorstep libraries like JustBooks, Doorstepbooks in Kolkata, and NOOL Library in Bangalore ensure that libraries are evolving with time and not dying out with the coming of more and more technological opportunities. To ensure such initiatives and unique formats of libraries do not go unnoticed among the masses, adequate support from the government, the private sector, and local communities is needed. As India moves forward in ensuring better literacy rates, enhancing the available resources for the betterment of society is very much necessary and crucial in ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of knowledge. niranjana.ps@thehindu.co.in Published - February 17, 2025 04:21 pm IST In School\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        lifestyle and leisure\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        leisure (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        World literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        literary greats\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        books and literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        books-children\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        books and publishing\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        classic books\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        library and museum\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        English literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Telugu literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Malayalam literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kannada literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Hindi literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bangalore\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Chennai\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Rajasthan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history books\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history and culture\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

February 18, 2025e-Paper Updated  - February 18, 2025 09:22 am IST Literature is about making sense of the world, writes the author. (Image for representation.)\n                                          | Photo Credit: Getty Images The air feels like a metaphor for love in Rupleena Bose’s debut novel, Summer of Then, a bildungsroman that maps its unnamed protagonist’s desires, ambitions and musings over a decade. The novel begins the day she meets the man she will inevitably get into a complicated relationship with, on a day when she is breathing the cleanest air of the decade, and ends bang in the middle of COVID-19 when the air is full of poison and contagion, and the man seems to have forgotten her. “It is the air that drove us apart, I tell myself,” she says in the novel. At its core, Summer of Then is a story of becoming and how relationships, cities and personal choices shape this process. It tells the story of a young English teacher caught between two men and how this romantic quagmire affects her life, dreams, and sense of self. In a similar vein as Rooney’s Conversations With Friends, Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation and Ferrante’s Neapolitan Novels, it also offers an exploration of the complexity and power of female friendship, a space that provides a safety net of sorts but is not inured from gestating disappointments or unuttered resentments. Bose’s prose is spare, lucid and elegant, ruminative without veering into excessive self-indulgence. Though one could argue that the book meanders in places, it is easy to forgive these superfluous sections since they are so few and far between. It also helps that the flawed, deeply insecure, self-absorbed and unreliable protagonist has a compelling, profoundly relatable voice that inveigles you into staying with the novel, even when the narrative falters. While not an easy read — there are disturbing bits, including descriptions of communal violence and rape — it is an effortless one, offering a much-needed portrait of an urban modern Indian woman torn between middle-class aspirations and morality and a hunger for so much more. “I could feel a wall of longing rise within me. It is like a physical thing. It is something that seemed to break through the self I had built,” writes Bose.

Some other themes explored in this novel set in multiple cities are the complexity of desire, the exponential rise of religious fundamentalism, the amorphous nature of identity, the indisputable impact of social class on art, the enduring legacy of colonisation on a nation’s cultural imagination and the pernicious persistence of violence against women. It is also rife with references to literary texts and the relevance of literature in our lives, not surprising in a novel written by someone who teaches the subject for a living. “Shakespeare is best adapted when it is set in India… The feudal world of that time still exists in India. It brings out the conflict of caste and class in a way European culture cannot dare to adapt Shakespeare,” writes Bose in one part of the book, while in another, she claims that literature is the only thing that ties the past and the present. “That is what literature is, making sense of the world.” preeti.zachariah@thehindu.co.in Published - February 17, 2025 12:25 pm IST The Hindu Sunday Magazine\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Literary Review\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        books and literature\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        authors and poets\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        fiction\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Indian fiction Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Kylie Minogue fans in wheelchairs who shelled out up to $302.75 to see the pop superstar in her Tension tour at Boondall this week spent hours of the concert unable to see the stage. Fans who were standing blocked views for wheelchair users in one of the Brisbane Entertainment Centre’s accessible sections, according to an eyewitness account. Front-of-house co-ordinators did not appear to be on hand to assist, said Joshua Jones, who was seated nearby.

That person was moved to a spot with better visibility of the stage, but security did not come back to the section to offer others assistance, he said. “Two young women tried to lift their friend out of her [wheel]chair, supporting her around the neck so she could see the stage ... After one song, they were forced to sit again.” Help eventually arrived at 9.57pm, more than two hours after the concert had begun, in the form of a Frontier Touring representative, who found alternative seating for the party closer to the stage. “Far too little, too late,” Jones said. “I can’t help but feel that Kylie Minogue, a performer who brings so much joy to her fans, would be heartbroken to hear that some of her admirers were unable to enjoy the experience.” Sporting Wheelies chief operating officer Dane Cross said issues like this “shouldn’t be happening in 2025”. He said venues should not only consider whether their spaces were accessible and functional, but also if their staff had adequate training in how to respond when accessibility issues rise. Kylie’s latest crop of shows have garnered rave reviews.Credit: Joe Armao A Brisbane Entertainment Centre spokesperson responded that more than 450 guests with accessibility needs were assisted over the two Kylie Minogue concerts this week. They said the venue had multiple dedicated front-of-house staff primarily to assist guests on arrival and throughout the event. They said that previous feedback from wheelchair advocates requested an inclusive experience on the Main Arena floor, and not to be segregated. “As a result, seating on both the reserved and the general admission floor was introduced and is included as part of every event build,” they said. The BEC said that it had received positive feedback from wheelchair users in the past. Cross said that the challenge facing venues was to avoid segregation, or wheelchair users being separated from their friends, while providing adequate sight lines. Mobility device user and frequent Boondall patron Tim McCallum agreed. “I would never complain about someone standing up in front of me dancing at a concert. You’re going to a Kylie Minogue concert, Kylie is renowned for having songs that make you want to dance. “Instead, have an accessible platform, so people with disabilities can see over those that stand. I’ve seen that at many venues around the country.” A spokesperson for Frontier Touring said that affected fans on Wednesday night were offered free tickets to the following night’s performance in a different seating location. The 13,500-capacity Brisbane Entertainment Centre opened in 1986. Its location and susceptibility to late-night traffic jams have made it controversial with visitors. Nevertheless it is slated to host Olympic events in 2032. “This is old infrastructure, and back then when these places were built, access and inclusion wasn’t front of mind,” Cross said. “That’s why it’s important now that whoever’s designing new and retrofitted facilities that universal design is applied and that access and inclusion is at the forefront of thinking.” Start the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

        "title": "Gene Hackman death ‘suspicious enough’ to warrant investigation: police",
        "text": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Police are hoping autopsy results will provide answers as to how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died in their Santa Fe home, in what officers say are suspicious enough circumstances to warrant a thorough investigation. Hackman, 95, was found dead on Wednesday (US time) in a mud room, near the kitchen area, according to a police affidavit. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, 63, was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, which police said could have fallen if Arakawa had abruptly dropped to the ground. There was an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a benchtop nearby. The couple had been dead for some time when they were discovered by a worker at the home. Arakawa’s body was showing signs of decomposition and mummification in her hands and feet, and Hackman’s body was in a similar state, an affidavit filed in application for a search warrant at the Santa Fe Magistrate Court by Detective Roy Arndt said. Denise Avila, a Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson, said initial autopsies on Hackman and Arakawa found no external trauma. But police consider the deaths “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation”, the affidavit says. At a press conference, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said they were “not ruling out foul play”. “This is an investigation, so we’re keeping everything on the table. I think the autopsy is going to tell us a lot,” he said. Detectives intend to seize any weapon, tool or instrument on the property capable of causing blunt force trauma to the human body as well as personal items and electronic devices. Hackman’s daughter Elizabeth Jean Hackman told entertainment news site TMZ that the family feared the deaths may have been caused by toxic fumes or carbon monoxide poisoning. Police said they had sought carbon monoxide and toxicology tests. The New Mexico Gas Co tested the gas lines in and around the home after the bodies were discovered, according to the affidavit. At the time, it didn’t find any signs of problems, and the fire department found no signs of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning. Detective Arndt noted that people exposed to gas leaks or carbon monoxide might not show signs of poisoning. Professor Jeffrey Bellin, who works at William & Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Virginia, said the request for a search warrant was unusual, as no alleged crime was mentioned. Police tend to overstate what they know, he said, but this is the opposite. “It just struck me as very careful in a way that search warrant affidavits often are not,” Bellin said. At his press conference, Sheriff Mendoza revealed that a pest control worker had first raised the alarm when he attended the property on Wednesday (US time) and believed the pair weren’t home, which seemed unusual. “He made contact with a security officer who was there, either patrolling or in the subdivision, and then it was a security officer that went to the house and discovered the individuals in the home,” Mendoza told reporters. In a 911 call obtained by TMZ, a man describing himself as a caretaker urges authorities to attend the property. Asked if the couple is awake or breathing, he says: “I have no idea. I’m not inside the house. It’s closed. It’s locked, I can’t go in, but I see them, she’s laying down on the floor.” Asked if either Hackman or Arakawa was moving, the caller says: “No, dude, they’re not moving. Just send somebody out here really quick.” The affidavit says that when officers arrived, the workers had found the front door of the house was open. Police said there was no sign of forced entry, and nothing appeared out of place. “[Police] did not observe any indication the residence had been rummaged through or items were taken from inside,” the affidavit read. Hackman appeared to have fallen, an officer observed. He was wearing a blue T-shirt, grey sweatpants and slippers. A pair of sunglasses and a cane were nearby. A German shepherd was found dead in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, police said. During the press conference, Mendoza said the dog was found in a kennel. Two healthy dogs were found on the property – one inside and one outside. Hackman was among the best actors of his generation, appearing as villains, heroes and antiheroes in dozens of dramas, comedies and action films from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. “He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us, he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,” his daughters and granddaughter said in a statement. Hackman was considered among the greatest American actors. He could play virtually any kind of role, from comic book villain Lex Luthor in Superman to a coach finding redemption in the sentimental favourite Hoosiers. He was a five-time Oscar nominee who won for The French Connection in 1972 and Unforgiven two decades later. His death came just days ahead of this year’s ceremony on March 2. Actor-director Clint Eastwood, Hackman’s Unforgiven co-star, released a statement saying: “There was no finer actor than Gene. Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.” Hackman met Arakawa, a classically trained pianist, when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, The New York Times reported in 1989. They soon moved in together, and by the end of the decade had relocated to Santa Fe. Their Southwestern-style ranch on Old Sunset Trail sits on a hill in a gated community with views of the Rocky Mountains. The four-bedroom home on 2.5 hectares was built in 1997 and had an estimated market value of a little over $US4 million ($6.4 million), according to Santa Fe County property tax records.

        "title": "We Do Not Part, Han Kang: Nobel laureate examines South Korea’s painful history",
        "text": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. FICTIONWe Do Not PartHan KangHamish Hamilton, $35 When the South Korean writer Han Kang won the Nobel Prize last year, celebrations broke out across the country. Some of the celebration must surely have taken place in the offices of the cultural bureaucracy, where the Swedish Academy’s announcement represented the culmination of a decades-long government project to win the world’s premier literary prize. Having already succeeded in the global cultural sweepstakes of music (Gangnam Style), film (Parasite) and television (Squid Game), South Korea was now the fourth Asian country to join the pantheon of literature in Stockholm. The world is now looking at South Korea; in We Do Not Part, Han’s 2021 novel newly translated into English, the Nobel laureate is looking squarely at the nation’s past. The narrative begins, as in Han’s most well-known novel, The Vegetarian, with a dream: a woman walks through a forest that gives “the impression of a hundred men, women and haggard children huddling in the snow”. Soon she senses she is in a kind of graveyard by the sea. The tide is coming in, and she tries to do what she can to preserve those buried. Our narrator, Kyungha, is the dreamer; in her waking life, she is a writer equally driven by a desire to rescue something of the past and help the innocent, no matter how futile it may be. Adrift and listless in the capital, she visits her friend Inseon, a documentary filmmaker, at a Seoul hospital. Inseon has injured herself in her studio and asks Kyungha to travel to Jeju Island for her pet bird, who has been locked away for days without food or water. What starts as a quixotic favour for a friend shifts into the realm of parable, as the narrator finds herself battling a snowstorm while she tries to find the small white creature. Nobel laureate Han Kang.Credit: Getty Images The blank, frozen landscape serves as a canvas for Han, a space where history becomes as vivid as the present. The narrative quickly slips away from realism to a literary form that incorporates both historical testimony and surreal devices: characters talk of whole villages burnt to the ground; ghosts appear by candlelight; remains are unearthed beneath airports; family members are taken in by authorities and never seen again; conversations are held across different decades. The past lies perfectly preserved beneath the snow. The central event of the historical violence, the author eventually makes clear, was the 1948-49 Jeju Uprising, in which large parts of the island’s population sought to protest against the partition of Korea, and oppose American influence on the nation’s politics. The rebellion was brutally suppressed, and those killed were painted for decades after as communist forces, as reds to be “exterminated”. These political and historical explanations only surface late in the novel, long after accounts of the brutalities and cruelties involved have rendered them senseless. Writing at such a lofty altitude runs the risk of leaving all but the most sincere readers behind. But even as Han’s writing generally forgoes humour and irony, it presents such fervent idealism, such unequivocal belief in literature as a humanitarian project, that it inspires admiration – not least in our age of ever more meaningless images and monetised distraction. The same fierce principles are to be found in Han’s public persona: when called to give a press conference for her Nobel Prize, she declined, saying that she could not celebrate at a time when wars were raging and innocents were suffering. Sadly, the writer’s moral clarity and fervency are let down by her translation into English. We Do Not Part was not translated by Deborah Smith, as in all Han’s previous works in English, but by a Korean and an American, e. yaewon and Paige Aniyah Morris. The prose here trades the sometimes controversial fluency of Smith’s prose for an apparent fidelity to the original Korean, resulting in a style that is frequently disjointed and clumsy. Some sentences feature bizarre choices of vocabulary and syntax, detracting from the significant emotional weight of the narrative (“Her eyes glistened with soundless tears, as if all the warm affection she’d stored for me over the last twenty years was seeping out at once”), while metaphors leave readers wondering how the original sounded (“The tight bulb of rice-coloured petals was dusted with snow that glimmered like sugar granules in the light”). Very little has changed by the close of We Do Not Part, but the novel ends on an image of hope, envisioning it as a delicate, living thing. In a world where the morals and ideals of a writer from Seoul can see her feted the world over, it could almost be convincing. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from Jason Steger.
