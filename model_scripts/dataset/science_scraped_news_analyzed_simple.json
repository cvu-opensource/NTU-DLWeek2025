        "title": "Fatbergs turned into perfume: Britain's new industrial revolution",
        "text": "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs. Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution. This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries. It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs. But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered? And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead. Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\" Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube. The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties. The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing. \"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\" If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels. But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure. One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals. \"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\" One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements. The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things. However all those possibilities require funding. The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment. On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain. The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this. \"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research. Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe. \"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues. \"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\" In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses. In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas. The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons. It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\". The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade. Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\". She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria. \"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\" Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government. \"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\" According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK. \"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\". Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London. \"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism. \"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\". Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money. A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat. \"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\" In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office. But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits. Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for. But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants. \"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\". Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks. More worrisome is that progress in bioengineering could one day lead to the creation of dangerous superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems. A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts. Writing in the journal Science, they said that while the capability to create mirror life is likely at least a decade away and would require large investments and major technical advances, these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks. Without action to reduce the risks, developments in biotechnology could increase the risk of bioterrorism in the future Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way. Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public. \"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".

        "title": "LA fires made worse by climate change, say scientists",
        "text": "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed. It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change. The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced. The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events. \"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author. \"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\" The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast. Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January. This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations. It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events. They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires. The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then. By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events. In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years. This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming. \"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution. \"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\" The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season. By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850. The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping. Another key element is drought. Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale. The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires. However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection. Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise. \"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team. \"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement. The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely. That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\" The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires. This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.

        "title": "Texas doctor addresses the region's measles outbreak : NPR",
        "text": "By Alejandra Marquez Janse , Matthew Cloutier , Adrian Florido , Patrick Jarenwattananon NPR's Adrian Florido speaks with Dr. Ron Cook of Lubbock, Texas, about the measles outbreak in his state \u2013 and what the Lubbock Health Department is doing to try to control it. ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  Rural northwest Texas is full of rolling plains and beautiful, wide open skies. It's also where officials are racing to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak of measles. Most of the state's nearly 150 confirmed cases have come from this region. On Wednesday, Texas officials announced the outbreak had claimed its first life, a child who was unvaccinated and was being treated at a hospital in the area's largest city, Lubbock. We've reached Dr. Ron Cook. He's a family physician and also the top medical officer in Lubbock. He's helping lead the public health response. Hello, Dr. Cook.RON COOK: Hello.FLORIDO: Dr. Cook, why is measles spreading in the communities near where you live?COOK: That's a largely unvaccinated community over there by choice. It's about an hour and a half away from us. And so measles is so infectious, it can really ravage through a population that's not vaccinated.FLORIDO: The epicenter of this outbreak is in Gaines County. I think that's where you're referring to.COOK: Yes, Gaines County.FLORIDO: Can you tell us some of the things that you and other health officials have been doing to try to contain this outbreak?COOK: Well, lots of education, of course. We've also offered a big - what we call an emergency response bus, a 15-passenger bus that's set up like a big portable clinic to give out vaccines, to do free testing and free vaccines and lots of education in the community trying to get people to understand that this is a very safe vaccine to take and then things to do in order to help prevent the spread of the disease further.FLORIDO: And what makes containing an outbreak so hard?COOK: It's so virulent and so infectious that the problem comes - if you're not vaccinated - so we put 100 people in a room, 90-plus people will be infected with this virus. You take flu, for example - you put 100 people in a room, one or two other people around you in the same amount of time will be infected. In this case, 80-plus, 90-plus percent of those people will be infected. It just spreads rapidly.FLORIDO: Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. a quarter-century ago, Dr. Cook, thanks to widespread vaccination. As you've noted, in these communities where the outbreak is spreading, a lot of folks are not vaccinated. There's a lot more skepticism about vaccines right now, a lot of that being fueled by officials at the very top of our government. Did you ever imagine you'd be trying to manage a measles outbreak of this scale?COOK: No. You know, this is a very safe vaccine. You know, there's some association thought that it caused autism. That has been disproven and certainly disinformation about this vaccine. It's been disproven over and over. You know, this hearkens back to COVID days, and I think this - that's what it feels to us, the public health people trying to stop the disease. And I think because of COVID, we've had more vaccine hesitancy, so we're seeing certainly a surge in flu. We're certainly seeing another surge in COVID. We're seeing surges of pertussis, which is the highest it's been in nine years. All those are vaccine-preventable diseases. And so we're seeing a rise in all of those, and it really makes us nervous.FLORIDO: How do you overcome some of these issues? How do you convince people to get vaccinated?COOK: Just lots and lots of education, trying to get people vaccinated - we're seeing certainly a bigger uptake in making sure everybody has their measles vaccine up to date, so we've had lots of luck doing that. We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be. And that's what I want emphasizes is, what we don't predict and can't predict is who's going to do worse if they get the disease, and it may be your child.FLORIDO: I understand you have a 10-month old granddaughter.COOK: I do. I do.FLORIDO: Are you worried about her?COOK: I am worried about her. In fact, her pediatrician gave her an early dose of the vaccine yesterday - not on my account, but because the pediatrician was also concerned.FLORIDO: How long might it take to get this outbreak under control in your communities, Dr. Cook?COOK: It's going to smolder for a while. You know, it's - fortunately, the bigger cities like Lubbock have a pretty high vaccination rate, so it'll slow down. There will still be cases of it prop up. We've already had two in our own city from an exposure. There are people that cannot take the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or somebody that's younger than six months. Those individuals can't take the vaccine, and we don't want those individuals sick. And so it's going to smolder, I think, for the next several months.FLORIDO: I've been speaking with Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock health authority and chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

And so it's going to smolder, I think, for the next several months.FLORIDO: I've been speaking with Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock health authority and chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

Rural northwest Texas is full of rolling plains and beautiful, wide open skies. It's also where officials are racing to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak of measles. Most of the state's nearly 150 confirmed cases have come from this region. On Wednesday, Texas officials announced the outbreak had claimed its first life, a child who was unvaccinated and was being treated at a hospital in the area's largest city, Lubbock. We've reached Dr. Ron Cook. He's a family physician and also the top medical officer in Lubbock. He's helping lead the public health response. Hello, Dr. Cook.RON COOK: Hello.FLORIDO: Dr. Cook, why is measles spreading in the communities near where you live?COOK: That's a largely unvaccinated community over there by choice. It's about an hour and a half away from us. And so measles is so infectious, it can really ravage through a population that's not vaccinated.FLORIDO: The epicenter of this outbreak is in Gaines County. I think that's where you're referring to.COOK: Yes, Gaines County.FLORIDO: Can you tell us some of the things that you and other health officials have been doing to try to contain this outbreak?COOK: Well, lots of education, of course. We've also offered a big - what we call an emergency response bus, a 15-passenger bus that's set up like a big portable clinic to give out vaccines, to do free testing and free vaccines and lots of education in the community trying to get people to understand that this is a very safe vaccine to take and then things to do in order to help prevent the spread of the disease further.FLORIDO: And what makes containing an outbreak so hard?COOK: It's so virulent and so infectious that the problem comes - if you're not vaccinated - so we put 100 people in a room, 90-plus people will be infected with this virus. You take flu, for example - you put 100 people in a room, one or two other people around you in the same amount of time will be infected. In this case, 80-plus, 90-plus percent of those people will be infected. It just spreads rapidly.FLORIDO: Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. a quarter-century ago, Dr. Cook, thanks to widespread vaccination. As you've noted, in these communities where the outbreak is spreading, a lot of folks are not vaccinated. There's a lot more skepticism about vaccines right now, a lot of that being fueled by officials at the very top of our government. Did you ever imagine you'd be trying to manage a measles outbreak of this scale?COOK: No. You know, this is a very safe vaccine. You know, there's some association thought that it caused autism. That has been disproven and certainly disinformation about this vaccine. It's been disproven over and over. You know, this hearkens back to COVID days, and I think this - that's what it feels to us, the public health people trying to stop the disease. And I think because of COVID, we've had more vaccine hesitancy, so we're seeing certainly a surge in flu. We're certainly seeing another surge in COVID. We're seeing surges of pertussis, which is the highest it's been in nine years. All those are vaccine-preventable diseases. And so we're seeing a rise in all of those, and it really makes us nervous.FLORIDO: How do you overcome some of these issues? How do you convince people to get vaccinated?COOK: Just lots and lots of education, trying to get people vaccinated - we're seeing certainly a bigger uptake in making sure everybody has their measles vaccine up to date, so we've had lots of luck doing that. We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be. And that's what I want emphasizes is, what we don't predict and can't predict is who's going to do worse if they get the disease, and it may be your child.FLORIDO: I understand you have a 10-month old granddaughter.COOK: I do. I do.FLORIDO: Are you worried about her?COOK: I am worried about her. In fact, her pediatrician gave her an early dose of the vaccine yesterday - not on my account, but because the pediatrician was also concerned.FLORIDO: How long might it take to get this outbreak under control in your communities, Dr. Cook?COOK: It's going to smolder for a while. You know, it's - fortunately, the bigger cities like Lubbock have a pretty high vaccination rate, so it'll slow down. There will still be cases of it prop up. We've already had two in our own city from an exposure. There are people that cannot take the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or somebody that's younger than six months. Those individuals can't take the vaccine, and we don't want those individuals sick.

We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be. And that's what I want emphasizes is, what we don't predict and can't predict is who's going to do worse if they get the disease, and it may be your child.FLORIDO: I understand you have a 10-month old granddaughter.COOK: I do. I do.FLORIDO: Are you worried about her?COOK: I am worried about her. In fact, her pediatrician gave her an early dose of the vaccine yesterday - not on my account, but because the pediatrician was also concerned.FLORIDO: How long might it take to get this outbreak under control in your communities, Dr. Cook?COOK: It's going to smolder for a while. You know, it's - fortunately, the bigger cities like Lubbock have a pretty high vaccination rate, so it'll slow down. There will still be cases of it prop up. We've already had two in our own city from an exposure. There are people that cannot take the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or somebody that's younger than six months. Those individuals can't take the vaccine, and we don't want those individuals sick. And so it's going to smolder, I think, for the next several months.FLORIDO: I've been speaking with Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock health authority and chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

FLORIDO: The epicenter of this outbreak is in Gaines County. I think that's where you're referring to.COOK: Yes, Gaines County.FLORIDO: Can you tell us some of the things that you and other health officials have been doing to try to contain this outbreak?COOK: Well, lots of education, of course. We've also offered a big - what we call an emergency response bus, a 15-passenger bus that's set up like a big portable clinic to give out vaccines, to do free testing and free vaccines and lots of education in the community trying to get people to understand that this is a very safe vaccine to take and then things to do in order to help prevent the spread of the disease further.FLORIDO: And what makes containing an outbreak so hard?COOK: It's so virulent and so infectious that the problem comes - if you're not vaccinated - so we put 100 people in a room, 90-plus people will be infected with this virus. You take flu, for example - you put 100 people in a room, one or two other people around you in the same amount of time will be infected. In this case, 80-plus, 90-plus percent of those people will be infected. It just spreads rapidly.FLORIDO: Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. a quarter-century ago, Dr. Cook, thanks to widespread vaccination. As you've noted, in these communities where the outbreak is spreading, a lot of folks are not vaccinated. There's a lot more skepticism about vaccines right now, a lot of that being fueled by officials at the very top of our government. Did you ever imagine you'd be trying to manage a measles outbreak of this scale?COOK: No. You know, this is a very safe vaccine. You know, there's some association thought that it caused autism. That has been disproven and certainly disinformation about this vaccine. It's been disproven over and over. You know, this hearkens back to COVID days, and I think this - that's what it feels to us, the public health people trying to stop the disease. And I think because of COVID, we've had more vaccine hesitancy, so we're seeing certainly a surge in flu. We're certainly seeing another surge in COVID. We're seeing surges of pertussis, which is the highest it's been in nine years. All those are vaccine-preventable diseases. And so we're seeing a rise in all of those, and it really makes us nervous.FLORIDO: How do you overcome some of these issues? How do you convince people to get vaccinated?COOK: Just lots and lots of education, trying to get people vaccinated - we're seeing certainly a bigger uptake in making sure everybody has their measles vaccine up to date, so we've had lots of luck doing that. We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be.

We've also offered a big - what we call an emergency response bus, a 15-passenger bus that's set up like a big portable clinic to give out vaccines, to do free testing and free vaccines and lots of education in the community trying to get people to understand that this is a very safe vaccine to take and then things to do in order to help prevent the spread of the disease further.FLORIDO: And what makes containing an outbreak so hard?COOK: It's so virulent and so infectious that the problem comes - if you're not vaccinated - so we put 100 people in a room, 90-plus people will be infected with this virus. You take flu, for example - you put 100 people in a room, one or two other people around you in the same amount of time will be infected. In this case, 80-plus, 90-plus percent of those people will be infected. It just spreads rapidly.FLORIDO: Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. a quarter-century ago, Dr. Cook, thanks to widespread vaccination. As you've noted, in these communities where the outbreak is spreading, a lot of folks are not vaccinated. There's a lot more skepticism about vaccines right now, a lot of that being fueled by officials at the very top of our government. Did you ever imagine you'd be trying to manage a measles outbreak of this scale?COOK: No. You know, this is a very safe vaccine. You know, there's some association thought that it caused autism. That has been disproven and certainly disinformation about this vaccine. It's been disproven over and over. You know, this hearkens back to COVID days, and I think this - that's what it feels to us, the public health people trying to stop the disease. And I think because of COVID, we've had more vaccine hesitancy, so we're seeing certainly a surge in flu. We're certainly seeing another surge in COVID. We're seeing surges of pertussis, which is the highest it's been in nine years. All those are vaccine-preventable diseases. And so we're seeing a rise in all of those, and it really makes us nervous.FLORIDO: How do you overcome some of these issues? How do you convince people to get vaccinated?COOK: Just lots and lots of education, trying to get people vaccinated - we're seeing certainly a bigger uptake in making sure everybody has their measles vaccine up to date, so we've had lots of luck doing that. We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be. And that's what I want emphasizes is, what we don't predict and can't predict is who's going to do worse if they get the disease, and it may be your child.FLORIDO: I understand you have a 10-month old granddaughter.COOK: I do. I do.FLORIDO: Are you worried about her?COOK: I am worried about her. In fact, her pediatrician gave her an early dose of the vaccine yesterday - not on my account, but because the pediatrician was also concerned.FLORIDO: How long might it take to get this outbreak under control in your communities, Dr. Cook?COOK: It's going to smolder for a while. You know, it's - fortunately, the bigger cities like Lubbock have a pretty high vaccination rate, so it'll slow down. There will still be cases of it prop up. We've already had two in our own city from an exposure. There are people that cannot take the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or somebody that's younger than six months. Those individuals can't take the vaccine, and we don't want those individuals sick. And so it's going to smolder, I think, for the next several months.FLORIDO: I've been speaking with Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock health authority and chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

In fact, her pediatrician gave her an early dose of the vaccine yesterday - not on my account, but because the pediatrician was also concerned.FLORIDO: How long might it take to get this outbreak under control in your communities, Dr. Cook?COOK: It's going to smolder for a while. You know, it's - fortunately, the bigger cities like Lubbock have a pretty high vaccination rate, so it'll slow down. There will still be cases of it prop up. We've already had two in our own city from an exposure. There are people that cannot take the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or somebody that's younger than six months. Those individuals can't take the vaccine, and we don't want those individuals sick. And so it's going to smolder, I think, for the next several months.FLORIDO: I've been speaking with Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock health authority and chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.

FLORIDO: How do you overcome some of these issues? How do you convince people to get vaccinated?COOK: Just lots and lots of education, trying to get people vaccinated - we're seeing certainly a bigger uptake in making sure everybody has their measles vaccine up to date, so we've had lots of luck doing that. We've seen even in that community that's been somewhat vaccine-hesitant. Especially as of, you know, unfortunate - our unfortunate death that we had, they're seeing how severe it can be.

        "title": "Residents near a fire at a California lithium battery plant worry about their health : NPR",
        "text": "By Elena Neale-Sacks In January, a lithium-ion battery-storage plant in Monterey County, Calif., caught fire and burned for days, prompting evacuations and school shut downs. Residents are concerned about their health. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Last month, one of the world's largest lithium battery storage facilities near Monterey, California, erupted in flames. People fled the area, and schools closed as the fire smoldered for days. It briefly reignited last week, and residents are worried about their health. From member station KAZU in Monterey, Elena Neale-Sacks reports.ELENA NEALE-SACKS, BYLINE: Small clouds dot the blue sky outside Sherry Okamoto's house in Royal Oaks. That's a rural community about six miles from the Moss Landing battery plant. It's starkly different from the afternoon of January 16, when a plume of stinky, black smoke moved in.SHERRY OKAMOTO: As soon as I opened the door, I got hit with burnt plastic.NEALE-SACKS: Okamoto says she didn't know what was going on. She and her husband were scared and started wrangling their animals - chickens, ducks, cats, dogs - to get them inside.OKAMOTO: My eyes were burning. My nose was burning. We were already coughing. And we weren't out long.NEALE-SACKS: That smoke was from a building that housed nearly a hundred-thousand lithium-ion battery modules that store renewable energy but had caught on fire. Monterey County quickly issued an evacuation order for people nearby.Lithium battery fires are notoriously hard to fight, and firefighters said they had to let it burn out because water would have been ineffective. The evacuation order was lifted the following evening. No homes were destroyed, but there was evidence of the fire even miles outside the evacuation zone. Okamoto still has a bucket filled with thick, black water that she hauled out of her duck pool.OKAMOTO: There's oil and soot and powder. And that's what I stuck my hands into 'cause I didn't want my ducks to get sick.NEALE-SACKS: She says the water burned her hands and gave her a rash. The Monterey County Health Department says 49 people have reported symptoms. County officials say preliminary tests of soil, water and air around the plant do not pose an immediate public health hazard, but two tests did show elevated contaminant levels that require follow-up. If people are worried, county officials say they should see their doctor. Meanwhile, thousands have joined Facebook groups where people are discussing the symptoms they think may be due to the fire.JEN WRENNE: I've had a lot of difficulty breathing. My heart rate will jump up like crazy.NEALE-SACKS: Jen Wrenne lives about 12 miles from the battery plant. She's gone to the doctor's office four times in the last month.WRENNE: The very first doctor told me, you have allergies.NEALE-SACKS: She asked for blood tests to check for the metals found in lithium batteries and then had to go back for a redraw because of a lab mix-up. When she still wasn't feeling well five days after that, a physician's assistant told her to see her primary care doctor.WRENNE: Which I can't get in to see for three months.NEALE-SACKS: She thought maybe she had a sinus infection and got antibiotics from a fourth doctor, but she still didn't feel better. Meanwhile, the heavy metal test didn't show anything concerning. Except, she says...WRENNE: They ended up testing magnesium instead of manganese.NEALE-SACKS: So she's getting yet another test.WRENNE: It's been really hard to get any kind of medical support or any medical help.NEALE-SACKS: In contrast to county and state tests, San Jose State University researchers took a number of soil samples close to the plant and found a spike in three toxic heavy metals. They were hundreds to a thousand times higher than before the fire.Don Smith is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says the state and San Jose test results look contradictory for a couple reasons. They sampled different locations, and San Jose state researchers only analyzed the topmost layer of soil. Some of the state tests included deeper samples, which, Smith says, could result in diluted levels of metals. He says people are right to want more clarity.DON SMITH: Collectively, the data that we've seen indicates that not enough has been done to determine what the risk to me may be if I was a resident in that area.NEALE-SACKS: Smith says heavy metals in lithium batteries are toxic at elevated exposures. They can cause respiratory issues and increase the risk of neurological disorders and developmental delays in children. Vistra, the company that owns the plant, did not respond to questions about its safety but has said it's investigating the cause of the fire. People who live near the plant have sued. They say Vistra failed to take proper safety measures. For NPR News, I'm Elena Neale-Sacks in Monterey.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That's a rural community about six miles from the Moss Landing battery plant. It's starkly different from the afternoon of January 16, when a plume of stinky, black smoke moved in.SHERRY OKAMOTO: As soon as I opened the door, I got hit with burnt plastic.NEALE-SACKS: Okamoto says she didn't know what was going on. She and her husband were scared and started wrangling their animals - chickens, ducks, cats, dogs - to get them inside.OKAMOTO: My eyes were burning. My nose was burning. We were already coughing. And we weren't out long.NEALE-SACKS: That smoke was from a building that housed nearly a hundred-thousand lithium-ion battery modules that store renewable energy but had caught on fire. Monterey County quickly issued an evacuation order for people nearby.Lithium battery fires are notoriously hard to fight, and firefighters said they had to let it burn out because water would have been ineffective. The evacuation order was lifted the following evening. No homes were destroyed, but there was evidence of the fire even miles outside the evacuation zone. Okamoto still has a bucket filled with thick, black water that she hauled out of her duck pool.OKAMOTO: There's oil and soot and powder. And that's what I stuck my hands into 'cause I didn't want my ducks to get sick.NEALE-SACKS: She says the water burned her hands and gave her a rash. The Monterey County Health Department says 49 people have reported symptoms. County officials say preliminary tests of soil, water and air around the plant do not pose an immediate public health hazard, but two tests did show elevated contaminant levels that require follow-up. If people are worried, county officials say they should see their doctor. Meanwhile, thousands have joined Facebook groups where people are discussing the symptoms they think may be due to the fire.JEN WRENNE: I've had a lot of difficulty breathing. My heart rate will jump up like crazy.NEALE-SACKS: Jen Wrenne lives about 12 miles from the battery plant. She's gone to the doctor's office four times in the last month.WRENNE: The very first doctor told me, you have allergies.NEALE-SACKS: She asked for blood tests to check for the metals found in lithium batteries and then had to go back for a redraw because of a lab mix-up. When she still wasn't feeling well five days after that, a physician's assistant told her to see her primary care doctor.WRENNE: Which I can't get in to see for three months.NEALE-SACKS: She thought maybe she had a sinus infection and got antibiotics from a fourth doctor, but she still didn't feel better. Meanwhile, the heavy metal test didn't show anything concerning. Except, she says...WRENNE: They ended up testing magnesium instead of manganese.NEALE-SACKS: So she's getting yet another test.WRENNE: It's been really hard to get any kind of medical support or any medical help.NEALE-SACKS: In contrast to county and state tests, San Jose State University researchers took a number of soil samples close to the plant and found a spike in three toxic heavy metals. They were hundreds to a thousand times higher than before the fire.Don Smith is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says the state and San Jose test results look contradictory for a couple reasons. They sampled different locations, and San Jose state researchers only analyzed the topmost layer of soil. Some of the state tests included deeper samples, which, Smith says, could result in diluted levels of metals. He says people are right to want more clarity.DON SMITH: Collectively, the data that we've seen indicates that not enough has been done to determine what the risk to me may be if I was a resident in that area.NEALE-SACKS: Smith says heavy metals in lithium batteries are toxic at elevated exposures. They can cause respiratory issues and increase the risk of neurological disorders and developmental delays in children. Vistra, the company that owns the plant, did not respond to questions about its safety but has said it's investigating the cause of the fire. People who live near the plant have sued. They say Vistra failed to take proper safety measures. For NPR News, I'm Elena Neale-Sacks in Monterey.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

My heart rate will jump up like crazy.NEALE-SACKS: Jen Wrenne lives about 12 miles from the battery plant. She's gone to the doctor's office four times in the last month.WRENNE: The very first doctor told me, you have allergies.NEALE-SACKS: She asked for blood tests to check for the metals found in lithium batteries and then had to go back for a redraw because of a lab mix-up. When she still wasn't feeling well five days after that, a physician's assistant told her to see her primary care doctor.WRENNE: Which I can't get in to see for three months.NEALE-SACKS: She thought maybe she had a sinus infection and got antibiotics from a fourth doctor, but she still didn't feel better. Meanwhile, the heavy metal test didn't show anything concerning. Except, she says...WRENNE: They ended up testing magnesium instead of manganese.NEALE-SACKS: So she's getting yet another test.WRENNE: It's been really hard to get any kind of medical support or any medical help.NEALE-SACKS: In contrast to county and state tests, San Jose State University researchers took a number of soil samples close to the plant and found a spike in three toxic heavy metals. They were hundreds to a thousand times higher than before the fire.Don Smith is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says the state and San Jose test results look contradictory for a couple reasons. They sampled different locations, and San Jose state researchers only analyzed the topmost layer of soil. Some of the state tests included deeper samples, which, Smith says, could result in diluted levels of metals. He says people are right to want more clarity.DON SMITH: Collectively, the data that we've seen indicates that not enough has been done to determine what the risk to me may be if I was a resident in that area.NEALE-SACKS: Smith says heavy metals in lithium batteries are toxic at elevated exposures. They can cause respiratory issues and increase the risk of neurological disorders and developmental delays in children. Vistra, the company that owns the plant, did not respond to questions about its safety but has said it's investigating the cause of the fire. People who live near the plant have sued. They say Vistra failed to take proper safety measures. For NPR News, I'm Elena Neale-Sacks in Monterey.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

NEALE-SACKS: Okamoto says she didn't know what was going on. She and her husband were scared and started wrangling their animals - chickens, ducks, cats, dogs - to get them inside.OKAMOTO: My eyes were burning. My nose was burning. We were already coughing. And we weren't out long.NEALE-SACKS: That smoke was from a building that housed nearly a hundred-thousand lithium-ion battery modules that store renewable energy but had caught on fire. Monterey County quickly issued an evacuation order for people nearby.Lithium battery fires are notoriously hard to fight, and firefighters said they had to let it burn out because water would have been ineffective. The evacuation order was lifted the following evening. No homes were destroyed, but there was evidence of the fire even miles outside the evacuation zone. Okamoto still has a bucket filled with thick, black water that she hauled out of her duck pool.OKAMOTO: There's oil and soot and powder.

The Monterey County Health Department says 49 people have reported symptoms. County officials say preliminary tests of soil, water and air around the plant do not pose an immediate public health hazard, but two tests did show elevated contaminant levels that require follow-up.

County officials say preliminary tests of soil, water and air around the plant do not pose an immediate public health hazard, but two tests did show elevated contaminant levels that require follow-up. If people are worried, county officials say they should see their doctor. Meanwhile, thousands have joined Facebook groups where people are discussing the symptoms they think may be due to the fire.JEN WRENNE: I've had a lot of difficulty breathing. My heart rate will jump up like crazy.NEALE-SACKS: Jen Wrenne lives about 12 miles from the battery plant. She's gone to the doctor's office four times in the last month.WRENNE: The very first doctor told me, you have allergies.NEALE-SACKS: She asked for blood tests to check for the metals found in lithium batteries and then had to go back for a redraw because of a lab mix-up. When she still wasn't feeling well five days after that, a physician's assistant told her to see her primary care doctor.WRENNE: Which I can't get in to see for three months.NEALE-SACKS: She thought maybe she had a sinus infection and got antibiotics from a fourth doctor, but she still didn't feel better. Meanwhile, the heavy metal test didn't show anything concerning. Except, she says...WRENNE: They ended up testing magnesium instead of manganese.NEALE-SACKS: So she's getting yet another test.WRENNE: It's been really hard to get any kind of medical support or any medical help.NEALE-SACKS: In contrast to county and state tests, San Jose State University researchers took a number of soil samples close to the plant and found a spike in three toxic heavy metals. They were hundreds to a thousand times higher than before the fire.Don Smith is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says the state and San Jose test results look contradictory for a couple reasons. They sampled different locations, and San Jose state researchers only analyzed the topmost layer of soil. Some of the state tests included deeper samples, which, Smith says, could result in diluted levels of metals. He says people are right to want more clarity.DON SMITH: Collectively, the data that we've seen indicates that not enough has been done to determine what the risk to me may be if I was a resident in that area.NEALE-SACKS: Smith says heavy metals in lithium batteries are toxic at elevated exposures. They can cause respiratory issues and increase the risk of neurological disorders and developmental delays in children. Vistra, the company that owns the plant, did not respond to questions about its safety but has said it's investigating the cause of the fire. People who live near the plant have sued. They say Vistra failed to take proper safety measures. For NPR News, I'm Elena Neale-Sacks in Monterey.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

        "title": "The FDA has canceled an important upcoming meeting about vaccines : NPR",
        "text": "Rob Stein The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was scheduled for next month. But the agency notified committee members that the meeting had been canceled. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The Food and Drug Administration has canceled an important upcoming meeting about vaccines. The surprise decision is intensifying concerns about the Trump administration's approach to vaccines here in the United States. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now. And Rob, I want to start with this meeting. Tell us who was supposed to meet, and why?ROB STEIN, BYLINE: This is a committee of independent, outside experts that advises the FDA about vaccines of all kinds, called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. People might remember this committee from the pandemic. This was the committee that reviewed all the COVID-19 vaccines for the FDA. It was supposed to meet March 13 to review the latest data about several vaccines and, most importantly, make a key decision about next season's flu vaccines.SUMMERS: Well, tell us about that. What exactly was the committee supposed to decide about the flu vaccines?STEIN: The committee planned to make a recommendation on the composition of the next flu vaccines - which strains of the flu virus to target in the vaccines to try to make the shots as effective as possible. The experts review all the latest data about which strains are circulating and make their best guess about which are most likely to be spreading next fall and winter to get the best possible match. This is something that happens every year around this time, and the timing is crucial because it takes months to produce enough vaccine. So the process has to start early or else the vaccine will be too late to protect people.SUMMERS: OK. And if there's a long-standing order of operations here and vaccine production is reliant on this decision, I would imagine that this meeting being canceled is not going over particularly well in the scientific community.STEIN: No, no. The cancellation of this advisory meeting is raising a lot of concerns among infectious disease experts, public health advocates and others. I talked with Dr. Paul Offit. He's a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who's been on the committee for years.PAUL OFFIT: Well, it's disappointing that they canceled this advisory committee meeting. We have met every March for the last decade and longer. I think there's a value in having an independent committee that looks at the data, holds it to a very high standard. That's a process that makes sure that we can have the best science behind the decisions we make.STEIN: He worries that next season's flu vaccines may not be ready in time or may not be the best match. And this development comes on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention canceling a similar meeting.SUMMERS: Also as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking charge of the Health and Human Services Department.STEIN: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, the HHS oversees both the FDA and CDC, and Kennedy is an outspoken critic of vaccines. And he's also criticized these committees specifically. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy argued he was supportive of vaccines, but he didn't really renounce any of the previous false claims he'd made about them. Dr. William Schaffner is an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University.WILLIAM SCHAFFNER: All of us have concerns about vaccine policy going forward, and the more we conform to the routine way of doing things, the more reassured we will be that vaccines will continue to be available as they should be to the American public.STEIN: He points out that the U.S. is in the midst of one of the worst flu seasons in years, and vaccination rates are down. And a big outbreak of measles - a disease that has come back because not enough parents are getting their kids vaccinated - has already claimed the life of one child in Texas.SUMMERS: Well, Rob, what is HHS saying about the shot for next flu season?STEIN: The Health and Human Services Department is promising the FDA will make a decision about the next flu vaccine composition in time to make sure the shots are ready, and a federal official who was not authorized to speak publicly told me the FDA would consult with the CDC, vaccine companies and others to make that decision.SUMMERS: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Rob, thank you.STEIN: You bet.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He's a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who's been on the committee for years.PAUL OFFIT: Well, it's disappointing that they canceled this advisory committee meeting. We have met every March for the last decade and longer. I think there's a value in having an independent committee that looks at the data, holds it to a very high standard. That's a process that makes sure that we can have the best science behind the decisions we make.STEIN: He worries that next season's flu vaccines may not be ready in time or may not be the best match. And this development comes on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention canceling a similar meeting.SUMMERS: Also as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking charge of the Health and Human Services Department.STEIN: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, the HHS oversees both the FDA and CDC, and Kennedy is an outspoken critic of vaccines. And he's also criticized these committees specifically. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy argued he was supportive of vaccines, but he didn't really renounce any of the previous false claims he'd made about them. Dr. William Schaffner is an infectious disease doctor at Vanderbilt University.WILLIAM SCHAFFNER: All of us have concerns about vaccine policy going forward, and the more we conform to the routine way of doing things, the more reassured we will be that vaccines will continue to be available as they should be to the American public.STEIN: He points out that the U.S. is in the midst of one of the worst flu seasons in years, and vaccination rates are down. And a big outbreak of measles - a disease that has come back because not enough parents are getting their kids vaccinated - has already claimed the life of one child in Texas.SUMMERS: Well, Rob, what is HHS saying about the shot for next flu season?STEIN: The Health and Human Services Department is promising the FDA will make a decision about the next flu vaccine composition in time to make sure the shots are ready, and a federal official who was not authorized to speak publicly told me the FDA would consult with the CDC, vaccine companies and others to make that decision.SUMMERS: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein.

The Food and Drug Administration has canceled an important upcoming meeting about vaccines. The surprise decision is intensifying concerns about the Trump administration's approach to vaccines here in the United States. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now. And Rob, I want to start with this meeting. Tell us who was supposed to meet, and why?ROB STEIN, BYLINE: This is a committee of independent, outside experts that advises the FDA about vaccines of all kinds, called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. People might remember this committee from the pandemic. This was the committee that reviewed all the COVID-19 vaccines for the FDA. It was supposed to meet March 13 to review the latest data about several vaccines and, most importantly, make a key decision about next season's flu vaccines.SUMMERS: Well, tell us about that. What exactly was the committee supposed to decide about the flu vaccines?STEIN: The committee planned to make a recommendation on the composition of the next flu vaccines - which strains of the flu virus to target in the vaccines to try to make the shots as effective as possible. The experts review all the latest data about which strains are circulating and make their best guess about which are most likely to be spreading next fall and winter to get the best possible match. This is something that happens every year around this time, and the timing is crucial because it takes months to produce enough vaccine. So the process has to start early or else the vaccine will be too late to protect people.SUMMERS: OK. And if there's a long-standing order of operations here and vaccine production is reliant on this decision, I would imagine that this meeting being canceled is not going over particularly well in the scientific community.STEIN: No, no.

SUMMERS: OK. And if there's a long-standing order of operations here and vaccine production is reliant on this decision, I would imagine that this meeting being canceled is not going over particularly well in the scientific community.STEIN: No, no. The cancellation of this advisory meeting is raising a lot of concerns among infectious disease experts, public health advocates and others. I talked with Dr. Paul Offit. He's a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who's been on the committee for years.PAUL OFFIT: Well, it's disappointing that they canceled this advisory committee meeting. We have met every March for the last decade and longer. I think there's a value in having an independent committee that looks at the data, holds it to a very high standard. That's a process that makes sure that we can have the best science behind the decisions we make.STEIN: He worries that next season's flu vaccines may not be ready in time or may not be the best match. And this development comes on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention canceling a similar meeting.SUMMERS: Also as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking charge of the Health and Human Services Department.STEIN: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, the HHS oversees both the FDA and CDC, and Kennedy is an outspoken critic of vaccines.

        "title": "Musk says Ebola aid was cut but restored. Ebola experts raise doubts : Goats and Soda : NPR",
        "text": "By Gabrielle Emanuel A member of a medical team at Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, administers a dose of a trial Ebola vaccine to a patient on Feb. 3. The country is currently experiencing an Ebola outbreak.\n                \nHajarah Nalwadda/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Speaking at President Trump's cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Elon Musk spoke bluntly about his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \"We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect,\" he said. \"When we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly. So, for example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.\" USAID is the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has largely been dismantled by the Trump administration. \"We restored the Ebola prevention immediately \u2014 and there was no interruption,\" Musk continued. In past Ebola outbreaks \u2014 such as when the infectious viral disease swept through much of West Africa in 2014 and 2016 \u2014 the U.S. has played a significant role in helping countries respond. They've provided expert advice as well as funds for efforts to control the spread of the virus \u2014 for example, helping pay for the secure transportation of suspected Ebola specimens from clinics to labs for testing and for exit screening at airports, where people leaving the country are checked to make sure they are not infected with Ebola. So is Musk accurate in his description of \"accidentally\" canceling and then restoring America's \"Ebola prevention\" efforts? Public health experts say his comments were partly right: U.S. efforts were indeed interrupted. But he got some facts wrong, they say: U.S. support has not been fully restored. \"I disagree fully, completely, wholly, that they recognized the mistake and put it back,\" says Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, who has worked on Ebola for more than a decade and responded to Ebola outbreaks in Africa. He says he's in regular contact with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who work on Ebola as well as physicians on the ground in Uganda, where an outbreak was declared on January 30, with nine confirmed cases and one death \u2014 of a nurse \u2014 so far. As of early February, the U.S. was not providing funding to support testing and port screenings in Uganda because of Trump's freeze on almost all U.S. foreign assistance. Acknowledging the absence of U.S. support, on February 2, Dr. Mike Ryan said in an interview with NPR that the World Health Organization \"will step in to provide resources for those functions.\" Ryan is the director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program. Within USAID's Global Health Bureau there was a team of people that specialized in high risk outbreaks, like Ebola. \"Virtually all of those people have been pushed out of the agency, and they have not been brought back. Only a very small handful \u2014 like low single digits \u2014 remain from what had been something like a 30 person team,\" says Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw USAID's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. He is now the president of Refugees International. Konyndyk used to lead what was called the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at USAID, which deployed on the ground in disasters like Ebola. \"The whole disaster response capability at USAID no longer exists. All of those people are gone. The operation centers that they worked out of are shut down. They can't even access the Ronald Reagan Building where those operation centers sit. That lease has been handed over to Customs and Border Protection,\" he says. He called Musk's reassurance that things have been restored \"total garbage.\" Inquiries to USAID and the State Department about what was canceled and restored, and when, were not answered. Instead, a State Department spokesperson wrote: \"The most important question we're answering during this review is: does it make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous? This is a process. If errors are made, they will be flagged and corrected as needed, while striving to do what's best for the American people.\" In response to an earlier inquiry about the U.S. role in the outbreak in Uganda, a spokesperson for the State Department wrote to NPR on February 14 that the U.S. government officials \"are working directly with the Government [of Uganda] to assess and identify evolving needs.\" As for the role of the CDC, Spencer says what its officials can do is limited by Trump's order that the CDC not communicate with WHO. The World Health Organization often serves a critical function in outbreak responses. Even if the response is led by the country in which the outbreak is happening, WHO provides expert advice and helps coordinate efforts. CDC officials \"aren't allowed to go to meetings with the World Health Organization, something they would have done in every single outbreak of Ebola \u2014 or other viral hemorrhagic fever disease \u2013 to date,\" Spencer says. \"From top to bottom, none of the things that they have canceled have been put back in place.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

        "title": "Scientists create \u2018e-Taste\u2019 device that could add flavour to virtual reality experiences | Science | The Guardian",
        "text": "Potential uses for gadget could include online shopping, weight management and sensory testing, say researchers If your colleague bores you to tears with pictures of their lunch, then a new gadget could make your life even worse. Scientists have developed a device to recreate the flavours of food and drink, allowing them to be shared remotely in a matter of seconds \u2013 but they have not yet cracked spicy food. They say the gadget, which they have called \u201ce-Taste\u201d, could be used to enhance virtual reality and augmented reality systems, boosting immersive experiences. It could also prove useful for biomedical research or even, the team suggests, for \u201cvirtual food adventures\u201d. \u201cPotential applications include immersive gaming, online shopping, remote education, weight management, sensory testing, physical rehabilitation and others,\u201d the researchers write. However, the team notes the system requires further development, not least as there are taste sensations the device cannot reproduce, such as spiciness and fattiness. While it is now possible share images, sounds and even physical sensations with others remotely, sharing smells or tastes has proved more challenging. Despite previous attempts by some researchers, the team behind the new study notes that there are numerous hurdles, not least that directly stimulating the tongue electronically or with warmth only enables a few tastes to be evoked; the use of chemicals can pose problems for reliability; and the arrangement of tastebuds on the tongue means it is necessary to target particular areas to create particular sensations. Writing in the journal Science Advances, the US-based scientists report how their e-Taste device has two key components. The first is a sensing platform \u2013 or \u201celectronic tongue\u201d \u2013 that captures data about the concentration of five different taste chemicals in a liquidised sample of a food or drink and sends the information wirelessly to the second component. This device uses small electromagnetic pumps to push liquids through a layer of gel containing five edible taste chemicals, allowing their delivery to an outlet, placed in a recipient\u2019s mouth, to be controlled. The five taste chemicals, which can be mixed before delivery, correspond to those detected in the original consumable item: glucose, which creates a sweet sensation; citric acid, which produces a sour taste; sodium chloride, which generates a salty flavour; magnesium chloride, a bitter taste; and glutamate, which elicits the savoury taste known as umami. The team adds that the system also allows flavours to be delivered to specific regions of the tongue \u2013 something they say could be used to investigate human taste perception. \u201cPeople will get something like a straw in their mouth, and thus placing it to specific locations when needed,\u201d said Yizhen Jia, a co-author of the study from Ohio State University. The team then conducted a number of tests. Among them, 10 volunteers were asked to sample different sour intensities in the liquids generated by the system, with the results revealing they were able to do so with an overall accuracy rate of 70%. In another test six volunteers were asked to sample different combinations of liquids containing the flavour chemicals, with the combinations designed to represent five different edible items \u2013 lemonade, cake, fried egg, coffee, and fish soup. They were then asked to taste a liquid generated by the system and select the foods they thought it represented. Overall they completed the task with accuracy rate of almost 87% \u2013 although spiciness is yet to be cracked. Marianna Obrist, a professor of multisensory interfaces at University College London, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the study. \u201cTaste stimulation is a particularly challenging area, yet the authors seem to present a compelling integration of taste sensations to enrich digital experiences,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Though scientist was not thought to be a great drinker, he may have used beer as an ingredient in the homemade ink in which he wrote his greatest work Isaac Newton has long been a familiar figure in museums around the world. Now, one of the famed scientist\u2019s most prized possessions is due to go on display for the first time in 160 years: his beer mug. The wooden mug will be on public display at the Royal Society, in central London, from 4 March, alongside items including Newton\u2019s greatest work, the Principia, and the scientist\u2019s death mask, which was prepared shortly after his death to serve as a likeness for sculptures. The exhibition is the culmination of 20 years of work by the scientist Carmichael Wallace and the historian Stephen Snobelen, who pieced together the mug\u2019s history through letters, genealogical records, family wills, magazines, newspapers and even a poem. Their research suggests that Newton only drank beer sparingly and instead, the mug points to his use of the beverage in his work. The duo\u2019s workings suggest that his best-known work, the Principia, may have been written in his homemade ink in which beer was a key ingredient. Newton gave the wooden flagon \u2013 a type commonly used for beer-drinking \u2013 to his roommate of 20 years, John Wickins, who also acted as his occasional laboratory assistant. The mug was found with other belongings at his home at Trinity College, Cambridge. Their research also highlights Newton\u2019s beer-related experiments, which included the study of fermentation, as well as his use of beer in the writing ink, which is still readable today in his notebooks and correspondence. Newton wrote two ink recipes, both likely penned in his beer-based ink. Less is known about Newton\u2019s drinking habits. According to his lab assistant, Humphrey Newton, Isaac drank beer and ale with meals and only sparingly. However, there are many references to beer, ale, cider and wine in Newton\u2019s surviving papers, including household inventories, as well as discussions on the best variety of apples to produce good cider in his correspondence with Henry Oldenburg. Newton recommended redstreaks. Snobelen said: \u201cThe mug was venerated by the Wickins family because it was owned by Newton. It was a kind of holy relic. \u201cAlthough chemical analysis of the ink in Newton\u2019s voluminous manuscript corpus has yet to be carried out, many 17-century authors used beer as a solvent in their homemade writing ink. Newton\u2019s two surviving ink recipes confirm that he followed in this craft, at least while he was at Cambridge.\u201d Keith Moore, the head of library and archives at the Royal Society, said: \u201cWe like to reflect upon past science, but a beery vision of Sir Isaac Newton is a new one for the Royal Society. According to his friends, the great man could be quite convivial, but I can\u2019t see him drinking too much from his flagon while fermenting his head-spinning ideas \u2013 as a scientist, Newton was no mug.\u201d The wooden \u201cpint flagon\u201d \u2013 as James Wickins, John\u2019s grandson, called it in the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine in 1802 \u2013 was publicly exhibited on at least three occasions, last in 1865. Newton was elected to the Royal Society in 1672, 12 years after its founding, and was its president from 1703 until his death in 1727.",

        "text": "The seven will appear to form a straight line in the night sky in display that won\u2019t be seen again until 2040 Seven planets will appear to align in the night sky on the last day of February in what is known as a planetary parade. These planetary hangouts happen when several planets appear to line up in the night sky at once. \u201cA planetary parade is a moment when multiple planets are visible in the sky at the same time,\u201d said Dr Greg Brown, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told PA Media. \u201cHow impressive a parade it is will depend on how many planets are in it and how visible they are.\u201d This week, all seven planets are technically visible in the sky at once, though they are not all equally easy to spot. \u201cMercury, Neptune and Saturn are all very close to the horizon in the early evening and, particularly in the case of Neptune and Saturn, will struggle to be seen in the twilight,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn addition, Uranus, like Neptune, is very faint, making it almost impossible to find without a pair of binoculars or a telescope. \u201cVenus, Jupiter and Mars, however, are all very easy to see with the unaided eye.\u201d A parade of four or five planets visible to the naked eye happens every few years, according to Nasa. \u201cGroups of three, four or even five planets being visible aren\u2019t uncommon, regularly appearing throughout each year,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut the more planets are involved, the more things need to be aligned to be visible at once. This makes full seven-planet parades fairly rare.\u201d The seven planets will next align in 2040. A similar parade took place last June, but only two planets could be seen without any special equipment. Six planets were visible in January \u2013 four to the naked eye \u2013 and now a dim Mercury joins the gang. This month, Venus, Mars and Jupiter are visible to the naked eye. A faint Saturn and Mercury are close to the horizon, making them hard to spot. Uranus and Neptune can be glimpsed with binoculars and telescopes. \u201cPlanetary alignments occur because the planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same plane, known as the ecliptic plane,\u201d Dr Shyam Balaji, a researcher in astroparticle physics and cosmology at King\u2019s College London, said. \u201cAs they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth\u2019s perspective.\u201d Balaji said the best time to see the alignment in the UK was 28 February, \u201cshortly after sunset, when the planets will be positioned above the western horizon\u201d. The same is true in Australia, where stargazers should look north after sunset, and the US, with experts suggesting those hoping to see the celestial show should head out about 30 minutes after sunset and stay away from bright lights. Stargazing apps can help people find out where to look just after sunset around the world. To find the planets with a telescope, look for moon shapes, Brown said. \u201cUsing a telescope, try looking for the moons of Jupiter or the shape of the illuminated part of Venus\u2019s surface \u2013 like a tiny crescent moon.\u201d The planets will slowly make their exit through the spring.

        "text": "Scientists find sterile ISS environment could explain rashes and cold sores and suggest adding microbes to stations Excessive cleanliness is not generally regarded as a downside when it comes to travel accommodation. However, scientists have concluded that the International Space Station is so sterile that it could be having a negative impact on astronauts\u2019 health and have suggested making it \u201cdirtier\u201d. The study found that the ISS is largely devoid of environmental microbes found in soil and water that are thought to beneficial to the immune system. The lack of microbial diversity could help to explain why astronauts often experience immune-related health problems such as rashes, cold sores, fungal infections and shingles. In future, putting these microbes in space stations could improve astronaut health without sacrificing hygiene, the researchers advised. \u201cFuture built environments, including space stations, could benefit from intentionally fostering diverse microbial communities that better mimic the natural microbial exposures experienced on Earth, rather than relying on highly sanitised spaces,\u201d said Rodolfo Salido of the University of California, San Diego and a co-author of the paper. The researchers collaborated with astronauts who swabbed 803 different surfaces on the ISS. Back on Earth, they identified which bacterial species and chemicals were present in each sample. Overall, human skin was the main source of microbes throughout the ISS, although the prevalence varied across different areas of the station. The dining and food preparation areas contained more food-associated microbes, whereas the space toilet contained more species associated with urine and faeces. Compared with most of the Earth samples, the ISS surfaces were lacking in free-living environmental microbes that are usually found in soil and water. Prof Rob Knight, a microbiologist at the University of California, San Diego and a senior author on the paper, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between exposure to healthy soil from gardening versus stewing in our own filth, which is kind of what happens if we\u2019re in a strictly enclosed environment with no ongoing input of those healthy sources of microbes from the outside.\u201d Chemicals from cleaning products and disinfectants were present ubiquitously throughout the station. The ISS was most similar to Earth samples from industrialised, isolated environments, such as hospitals, according to the paper, which has been published in the journal Cell. \u201cIf we really want life to thrive outside Earth, we can\u2019t just take a small branch of the tree of life and launch it into space and hope that it will work out,\u201d said Salido. \u201cWe need to start thinking about what other beneficial companions we should be sending with these astronauts to help them develop ecosystems that will be sustainable and beneficial for all.\u201d Dr Odette Laneuville, a biologist at the University of Ottawa who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe environment is important for the immune system because it senses constantly those pathogens and it triggers a response or not.\u201d However, she said caution would be required when considering intentionally seeding a space environment with microbes from Earth. \u201cI don\u2019t want parasites and fungi up there,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "USAid cuts to clinics dispensing antiretroviral drugs will be \u2018death sentence for mothers and children\u2019, expert warns Sweeping notices of termination of funding have been received by organisations working with HIV and Aids across Africa, with dire predictions of a huge rise in deaths as a result. After the US announced a permanent end to funding for HIV projects, services across the board have been affected, say doctors and programme managers, from projects helping orphans and pregnant women to those reaching transgender individuals and sex workers. The cuts could result in 500,000 deaths over the next 10 years in South Africa, modelling suggests, while thousands of people are already set to lose their jobs in the coming days. The US government has announced it will be cutting more than 90% of the contracts of its key development agency, USAid, and slashing $60bn (\u00a348bn) of overseas aid spending. The Guardian has heard that notices of termination have been sent to organisations in other countries in the region, including Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, as well as with the joint United Nations programme UNAids. The Elizabeth Glaser Paediatric Aids Foundation said it had received termination notices for three of its projects, which provide HIV treatment for more than 350,000 people in Lesotho, Eswatini and Tanzania. The figure includes more than 10,000 HIV-positive pregnant women, who must continue taking antiretroviral drugs to avoid passing the disease on to their babies. Dr Lynne Mofenson, a senior adviser at the foundation, said the decision was \u201ca death sentence for mothers and children\u201d. Many projects had been forced to stop work in late January after the Trump administration announced a 90-day review of foreign aid. A few were then granted temporary waivers to continue on the grounds that they provided life-saving services, before receiving notices on Thursday instructing them to close their doors permanently. Projects funded by the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), founded by George W Bush in 2003, appear to be particularly affected. In South Africa it funds 17% of the HIV response; in other countries the figure is much higher. Prof Linda-Gail Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town, said: \u201cIt is not hyperbole to say that I predict a huge disaster.\u201d Bekker has worked on modelling suggesting a complete loss of Pepfar funding in South Africa would lead to more than 500,000 extra HIV deaths over a decade. It comes at a time when scientific breakthroughs, such as the introduction of long-acting injectable prevention drugs, meant many working in the HIV field had hoped an end to the disease might be in sight. Now, said Bekker, it was likely things would go backwards. South Africa has about 8 million people living with HIV, the highest number globally. She said she had initially expected the US to target programmes working with key groups of people such as the LGBT+ community, because of the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on diversity initiatives, \u201cbut in fact, this has been across the board. \u201cThis is children, this is orphans, vulnerable children, young women and girl programmes. It is generic and across the board.\u201d It also halts ongoing research, including trials into potential HIV vaccines and new prevention drugs, Bekker said. US funding had allowed projects to fill gaps in government provision, such as clinics where transgender people or sex workers can seek care without stigma or legal concerns, Bekker said. Kholi Buthelezi, national coordinator at Sisonke, a sex workers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been having sleepless nights. This blow, it reminded us of back when there was no cure for HIV.\u201d At a press briefing on the cuts, she and others working on HIV in South Africa called on their government to \u201cstep up\u201d and fill the gaps left by the US\u2019s withdrawal. Pepfar funding has been distributed via USAid and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Programmes with funding from the CDC have not yet been forced to shut, said Dr Kate Rees, a public health medicine specialist at the Anova Health Institute, but said it was too early to conclude that those programmes were safe. There had already been plans to shift programmes reliant on donors to government funding over the next five years, Rees said, but \u201cnow, instead of a careful handover, we\u2019re being pushed over a cliff edge\u201d. US funding had been embedded in the health system, she said, and so the withdrawal would \u201cbe felt by everyone who uses or works in health services\u201d. Anova has received a termination notice. \u201cTomorrow we are letting go more than 2,800 people,\u201d Rees said. \u201cThat\u2019s counsellors, data capturers, healthcare workers \u2013 and these people are not going to find other jobs very easily.\u201d",

        "text": "Shift in circulating strains means those who\u2019ve already had vomiting bug this winter risk catching it again The UK could be facing a second wave of the winter vomiting bug, norovirus, the UK Health Security Agency has warned. The latest figures show a rise in norovirus across the UK, with reported cases at the highest level in more than a decade. A shift in circulating strains means that those who have already been ill with norovirus this winter are at risk of catching it again. Amy Douglas, a lead epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: \u201cNorovirus levels are still exceptionally high, and now with multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season.\u201d Laboratory-confirmed cases in the two weeks from 3 to 16 February were 29% higher than the previous fortnight and more than double the five-season average (168%) for the same two-week period, the latest UKHSA data shows. This puts the prevalence at the highest level since the agency began reporting data this way in 2014. The impact is particularly severe in hospitals and care homes, with cases highest among people aged 65 and over. Douglas said: \u201cWe are seeing the biggest impacts in health and social care settings, such as hospitals and care homes. Symptoms of norovirus can be more severe in older adults, young children and those who are immunocompromised.\u201d The latest data also shows a shift in circulating strains. Cases of a strain known as GII.4, which has dominated in previous years, have sharply risen, now representing 29% of cases compared with just 10% three months ago. So far this year the recently emerged GII.17 strain has dominated, but now accounts for 59% of cases, down from 76% of cases in November. Common symptoms of norovirus include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, high temperature, stomach pains and aching limbs. Some people, particularly young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, are more likely to develop severe symptoms, which can cause dehydration. Anyone with these symptoms is advised to drink plenty of fluids to avoid this. Sign up to Headlines UK Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion UKHSA advises anyone with norovirus symptoms not to visit hospitals and care homes or return to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped and not to prepare food for others during this time period. Cases usually start to decline around this time of year as the weather gets warmer and people spend less time indoors, but UKHSA said it is too soon to judge whether or not norovirus has peaked this season. UKHSA experts estimate that reported cases represent only a small fraction of actual infections. For every case reported to national surveillance, approximately 288 cases occur in the community, suggesting about 3m cases annually in the UK.",

        "text": "Workers at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fear crackdown will have global fallout The Trump administration has set its sights on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US\u2019s pre-eminent climate research agency, with significant cuts and a political crackdown on climate science. As Trump takes aim at the agency, the impact is likely to be felt across the US and around the world. Noaa provides essential resources to the public and has helped make the US a scientific leader internationally. Operating 18 satellites and 15 research and survey ships, the agency\u2019s scientists, engineers and policy experts issue forecasts relied on by aviation, agriculture and fishing industries. It advises on species protection and provides ocean floor mapping depended upon for shipping and increasingly precise and accurate modeling on what to expect as climate crisis unfolds. Noaa is also a primary resource for emergency managers and the public during extreme weather events and natural disasters when fast, accurate information matters most. Experts and officials have warned that dismantling and defunding the agency will come with severe consequences that will only increase as the world heats. \u201cJust about every component of the agency contributes to our understanding of the climate,\u201d said Craig McLean, the former director of Noaa research who served the agency for four decades before retiring in 2022. \u201cDoes that paint a big target on Noaa? Absolutely,\u201d he said, adding that this would be \u201cdamaging to the country\u2019s economic outlook, the well being, the food security, and the general security of the public\u201d. The administration began laying the groundwork with key changes at the agency in recent weeks, according to staffers and contractors who spoke to the Guardian under the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The employees said staff at the agency has been instructed to prepare for severe reductions in staffing; the administration has indicated the agency\u2019s budget may be cut by roughly a third. Projects focused on expanding inclusion and equity within the scope of the work including those that sought to bring in more tribal expertise, have ground to a halt. Representatives from the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge) breezed past security at headquarters earlier this month and demanded access to IT systems. Staff was also instructed to turn over editorial control of intranet sites to Doge, in emails that have been reviewed by the Guardian. Workers have been asked to compile databases of contracts and grants that contain references to environmental policy or particular key words, including \u201cclimate change\u201d, \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cenvironmental agreement\u201d, for further evaluation. The administration, staffers said, is evaluating whether documents \u2013 which range from scientific studies to international policy \u2013 comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders. Like other federal employees, staffers were also instructed to send emails to their supervisors detailing five things they achieved in the previous week. Even though the US government\u2019s human resources office countered Musk\u2019s claims that a failure to send the emails would be regarded as a resignation, Noaa employees have been asked by officials at the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, to send them. \u201cWe are waiting for the ax to drop,\u201d said a worker at the agency. Some agency leaders have been put on administrative leave, she added, and others were asked to pull together lists of probationary employees, a categorization that applies to new hires or those moved or promoted into new positions \u2013 roughly 10% of the agency\u2019s workforce. \u201cFor an administration so focused on economic outcomes,\u201d she added, \u201cTrump\u2019s math on this is all wrong.\u201d Officials who have worked at the top levels of Noaa spoke about its essential mission and how close to the edge it already operates, hampered by small budgets and limited staffing. \u201cThe agency is out-demanded given the resources made available,\u201d McLean said. \u201cIf we start taking people away that has a further exacerbating effect. We are barely able to keep our heads above water at this point.\u201d Even with a tight budget, Noaa has played a pivotal role in public safety, providing key insights and forecasts relied upon by a vast array of communities and industries, from weather shifts that could impact crop schedules, to emergency response preparation when hurricanes are brewing or fire conditions are aligning. The agency operates warning systems for tsunamis, monitors seafood supply chains and provides ocean data needed for safe shipping and port operators. \u201cNoaa is a science agency but it also delivers services directly to the American people and in some sense to the global community,\u201d said Dr Andrew Rosenberg, former deputy director of Noaa\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service. \u201cIt is extraordinarily difficult to achieve the mission with less people.\u201d But it\u2019s the mission itself that Trump has called into question. Both in his first term and now in his initial weeks in office, the president has undertaken an anti-science approach, especially when it comes to climate crisis. Project 2025, a policy playbook authored by numerous former Trump officials, calls for \u201cbreaking up and downsizing\u201d Noaa due to its work to increase understanding of the crisis. Claiming the research is \u201charmful to future US prosperity\u201d, the document\u2019s authors insist Noaa should be disbanded, proposing instead to shift functions to the private sector. Plans include appointing leadership that aligns with the administration to \u201cprevent obstructionism\u201d, downsizing offices and culling regulations, actions that Rosenberg and McLean said would prove disastrous for the public that relies on Noaa. \u201cMy fear is that they will gut the work,\u201d McLean said of the administration, likening Doge employees to car mechanics trying to perform open heart surgery. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing \u2013 they just want to bring in a hammer and smash it.\u201d Already the US has lost its position as a scientific leader following the president\u2019s withdrawal from international accords, including the Paris climate agreement. Calls for privatising Noaa\u2019s vast offerings fail to take into account how much businesses, including those that offer weather forecasts, depend on Noaa data and the satellites and models it operates. \u201cWe have the largest, most sophisticated science enterprise in the world,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cAnd we are going to throw it away because somebody doesn\u2019t like the word climate change?\u201d",

        "title": "First patient in UK tests new treatment for loss of sense of smell | Medical research | The Guardian",
        "text": "Chrissi Kelly, who says anosmia is a \u2018like a bereavement\u2019,  is trialling a simple procedure that could help those who lost sense of smell during Covid or other viral infections Smell loss was a defining symptom of Covid, and for some people, a curse. Most people regain their sense of smell as their infection fades, but some never recover. It means not being able to tell if milk is off, if there\u2019s a gas leak or what your newborn baby smells like. But for victims of anosmia and its crueller sibling, parosmia, where ordinary smells are transformed into the stench of rotting flesh or sewage, there is new hope. Researchers have discovered that a simple procedure can help people recover their sense of smell years after losing it to viral infections such as Covid, or even decades later. The first patient in the UK began receiving treatment this month and doctors hope the process could be easily rolled out across the NHS. Chrissi Kelly is the first patient in the UK to receive the treatment, which consists of injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from her own blood, prepared by using a centrifuge to separate the platelets from red and white blood cells. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to be able to say \u2018there\u2019s a treatment\u2019, because for years that was just off the table,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s thrilling to be asked to be the first one to receive it.\u201d Kelly lost her sense of smell after developing sinusitis in 2012, and describes anosmia as \u201clike a bereavement\u201d. After three months she began to hallucinate smells, a condition known as phantosmia, then developed parosmia. The only help she could find was research that suggested she could retrain her sense by inhaling known smells such as coffee and lavender. The condition was so little known that Kelly decided to set up a charity, AbScent, to offer support to other sufferers and make other smell-training kits. The Covid pandemic changed everything, with millions of people around the world losing their sense of smell, including Katherine Ryan, the comedian, who said the disorder made her feel \u201chelpless\u201d. AbScent went from 1,500 members in its support group to 95,000 at the same time as its income from the smell-training kits disappeared when cheaper competitors emerged. She closed the charity last year. But the pandemic also sparked a new wave of research. Prof Zara Patel, director of endoscopic skull base surgery at Stanford University, had been examining anosmia for some time and spotted a neurology paper that suggested PRP might help regenerate nerves. This is important because of the reason Covid affects smell \u2013 the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to cells around the olfactory nerve at the top of the nose. \u201cThe way that the olfactory system and olfactory nerve works is unique in all the other cranial nerves,\u201d Patel told the Observer. \u201cNone of the other cranial nerves have the ability to regenerate, but the olfactory nerve does.\u201d So if PRP could help the olfactory nerve regenerate, it might relieve anosmia. Patel set up a series of randomised control trials \u2013 easier to recruit after Covid \u2013 and found that PRP worked better than a placebo after three months and the effect was greater after 12 months. In one case, a 73-year-old man recovered his smell 45 years after losing it. Patel\u2019s work impressed Prof Claire Hopkins, a former president of the British Rhinological Society and professor of rhinology at King\u2019s College London who practises at Guy\u2019s hospital in London. She was one of the first people to identify a link between Covid and anosmia and had been investigating other treatments such as steroids. Sign up to Observed Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers after newsletter promotion \u201cI\u2019ve been hesitant before because I know many patients are desperate and will try anything,\u201d Hopkins said, mentioning folk remedies such as burning oranges that are ineffective. \u201c[The evidence] is significant to a point that I feel I should be offering this to my patients, and it is a relatively minimally invasive procedure. The risks are small, so I think it is something I can now offer. I will look to try to set this up within the NHS. PRP is used within the NHS for other things, so I\u2019m hopeful we will be able to offer it.\u201d Because PRP is made with centrifuges that are already being used in hospitals, and uses a patient\u2019s own blood, there are fewer regulatory hurdles than other medical procedures. Hopkins and other ear, nose and throat teams need to get approval for the procedure from their hospital boards. Kelly needs to have two further PRP injections over the next three months to complete the treatment. She is cautious about whether she can already sense any effects. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most acute observer of my own sense of smell,\u201d she said, referring to her years of smell training. \u201cI still can\u2019t eat onions. I\u2019m great with coffee, but there are other things like roasted meat I really don\u2019t enjoy as much as I used to. \u201cWhen I step out of the house in the morning, I will recognise that I\u2019m getting some kind of feedback on what the time of year is and that sort of thing. It\u2019s not always easy for me to say I smell something specific, but I\u2019m always aware of that. \u201cAnd the other day, I stepped out of my house, and I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018Oh gosh, that smells good.\u2019 And before I turned around, I thought to myself, \u2018That smells like winter-flowering jasmine.\u2019 And it was.\u201d",

        "text": "The British scientist on the risk of humans contracting bird flu, how people would cope with new lockdowns and being asked to pour the tea because she is a woman Wendy Barclay is a leading British virologist and head of the department of infectious disease and the Action Medical Research chair in virology at Imperial College London. An expert on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses, she served on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing advice on the risks posed by the coronavirus and appropriate medical countermeasures. What prompted you to study virology?\n After I graduated from Cambridge with a degree in natural sciences I thought I might get a job with a pharmaceutical company. Then I saw that the Common Cold Unit in Salisbury was looking for a PhD to work on rhinoviruses, the viruses that cause the common cold. I hadn\u2019t studied viruses before, but that same year \u2013 1988 \u2013 the first crystal structure of a virus was published and it was a rhinovirus. The Common Cold Unit was a steep learning curve. Have there been times when it\u2019s been difficult to be a woman working in virology?Yes. There\u2019s a famous \u201csilver teapot\u201d story I tell about my time as a junior lecturer, where I was always being dragged on to interview panels as the token woman. On one occasion, the dean of chemistry turned to me and said: \u201cI\u2019ll take mine with milk and two sugars.\u201d The other men in the room cringed with embarrassment and leapt forward to pour the tea before I could. I think it\u2019s important for women working in science to have female role models. I\u2019m a head of department at Imperial and I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve recruited several young female lecturers, who are all excellent. I firmly believe that\u2019s because they can see that Imperial is a place where women can thrive and become leaders. Tell us about your research into H5N1 bird flu. What is it about the virus that keeps scientists up at night?Bird flu viruses are circulating all the time. The H5N1 subtype that is causing so much concern at the moment first infected humans in 1997, but although it caused severe disease it never took off as a pandemic. Afterwards, it retracted back into the wild bird population, but it never really went away: we saw widespread outbreaks in poultry, with some human cases, in the early 2000s. Then, in 2014, it reared its head again. The problem is these wild avian viruses are mixing up their genetics all the time. It\u2019s like viral sex on steroids. At some point, they come up with a solution that improves their fitness and their ability to infect new hosts. So, what\u2019s going on now?In 2020, a new H5N1 variant, known as clade 2.3.4.4b, emerged. Wild birds spread it across huge areas and it did what influenza always does in wild birds, it shuffled its genome around. Some strains have also infected a wide range of mammals, including cows. There it appears to be highly concentrated in the teats and mammary glands and when you plop another cow on to the same milking machine it transfers from one cow to the other. Influenza has not been reported before in cows and the virus is replicating so well in them that we suspected that between crossing from birds and becoming established in these herds, the virus must have undergone adaptive mutations. I believe you have just circulated a new pre-print (draft research paper) describing some of these mutations.Yes, I\u2019ve been heading a consortium of UK-based influenza virologists researching how the virus is evolving. In a recent study, we identified two key mutations that have enabled the virus to replicate more efficiently inside the cells of infected cattle. The worrying thing is that the same mutations also enable the virus to replicate better in pig and human cells, meaning it has moved one step closer to being adapted for humans. We also found that the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have picked up a different neuraminidase gene (the N in H5N1) than the older viruses of the early 2000s. The new N helps the virus cut through human mucus more efficiently and target cells in our nose and throat more readily. This is yet one more block that the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have overcome to becoming human adapted. So how concerned should we be?Whenever bird flu gets into any mammals it undergoes mutations that can bring it a little closer to being the sort of virus that can spread between humans. To date, we\u2019ve seen 66 confirmed and eight probable human cases of the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus in the US. Two of these, one in British Columbia, the other in Louisiana, caused severe illnesses. Earlier this month, the patient from Louisiana died. Does this mean we should expect a pandemic of H5N1 imminently?\n Not necessarily. The virus is able to replicate inside human cells but has not acquired the set of mutations in the HA gene (the H in H5N1) required to transmit between people through the air. From laboratory studies of influenza we know that, to transmit, the virus must switch to use a human receptor, but receptor switching is not enough on its own to support airborne transmission. You need a second change that makes the H more stable in harsh environments like the droplets we breathe out from our respiratory tract. We haven\u2019t seen any evidence of that yet, either in people, cows or any animals in the wild. How prepared are we for a bird flu pandemic? And what if the next pandemic was sparked by a \u201cDisease X\u201d, a pathogen unknown to science?The good news is that the World Health Organization has been keeping pace with the evolution of the bird flu virus and we have vaccine seed strains that could be used to make lots of vaccine in the event of an outbreak. We also have tried and tested licensed antiviral drugs, like Tamiflu and Relenza. And thanks to mRNA vaccine technology, pharmaceutical companies are also in a much better position to make vaccines against a new virus, including a new flu strain or another novel coronavirus. If there was a bird flu pandemic and we had to resort to lockdowns again, do you think people would be as compliant as before?No, I think they would struggle. If there\u2019s a two- to three-day turnaround to get a diagnosis and people are having to miss work when they need to earn money, it\u2019s understandably a very difficult decision. But one of the great things we learned during Covid is that people are capable of using home diagnostic kits - swabbing their nose and throat to test for infection. Maybe I have an optimistic view of humanity but my vision is for a test in everyone\u2019s bathroom cabinet. Then, when you hear that a new virus is spreading, you can make a socially responsible decision to test and whether to go out or not.",

        "text": "People with post-infectious diseases sometimes struggle to communicate the debilitating impact of their conditions. But a new technique can help them explain visually Post-infectious diseases such as long Covid and ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) pose a puzzle to the medical establishment. Patients report debilitating symptoms such as extreme fatigue, shortness of breath or muscle pain, but often show normal results on routine medical checkups. And many sufferers do not look ill, leading some to question the severity of their disease. In the absence of diagnostic tools or an understanding of the pathophysiological processes, many sufferers find it difficult to share their experiences. They lack a verbal language that expresses the true impact of the illness. Now, researchers from Oxford University are using the technique of \u201cbody mapping\u201d to help patients better communicate the physical, cognitive and emotional dimensions of their illness to family, friends and health professionals. Oxford\u2019s Maaret Jokela-Pansini is interested in how illness feels. \u201cPeople experience illness in many different ways depending on economic, social and cultural factors such as age, gender or possibilities to access healthcare,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we talk about health and disease, we must always take space and time into account.\u201d Jokela-Pansini first became acquainted with body mapping when she was working in a women\u2019s organisation in Honduras that ran workshops in prisons. The technique, which involves creating a lifesize outline of a body, aims to capture patients\u2019 experiences and has been used in trauma therapy and with chronic pain patients. \u201cWe call it \u2018alternative cartography\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think of the body as a map: pain, emotions, experiences, they are all located somewhere in your body, which in turn is seen in relation to a specific environment.\u201d Last year, she teamed up with the Oxford professor Beth Greenhough and they adapted the method for their project Visualising Long Covid. So far, eight workshops have been organised in London and Oxford with the help of the charity Long Covid Support. The participants begin with tracing their bodies on paper. They are then given a list of questions and asked to draw, write or collage their responses on to the map of their body. How did you experience your health before getting long Covid? What impact has it had on everyday life? What kind of support do you get? How has the illness changed the way you view yourself? \u201cBody mapping is really about storytelling,\u201d says Jokela-Pansini. Most participants begin with their head or their heart. \u201cFamily members are often in the heart,\u201d she says. And despite each body map being unique, there are recurring motifs, such as shadows. \u201cParticipants use them in the sense that they are now only a shadow of what they were before and that they feel left behind. The world has moved on, but they are still living in the pandemic \u2013 an experience that can be profoundly isolating.\u201d Oonagh Cousins at Long Covid Support says body mapping allowed her to reflect on how illness is experienced in different parts of the body. Cousins participated in one of the first workshops and later joined the project as a research fellow. \u201cYou might ask: where is the pain located? Is it in the gut, in the heart, in the arms? What does it feel like? Is it red, is it orange, is it lots of scribbles, is it soft? And what about going to a clinician and being told: \u2018It\u2019s all in your head\u2019? Where would you draw the emotion of that experience on your body?\u201d Body mapping invites lots of different ideas and allows you to share them with other participants, she says. Cousins finds the vocabulary used in connection with long Covid unhelpful. \u201cFatigue, \u2018brain fog\u2019 \u2013 these words don\u2019t do justice to what people are actually experiencing. Fatigue sounds like tiredness, but it is in fact deep sickness. It feels like the worst hangover of your life combined with the worst flu of your life. Your brain and your whole body, everything, feels very, very weak and fragile. You\u2019re not you any more.\u201d The same goes for the term \u2018brain fog\u2019, which has an almost cosy connotation. It doesn\u2019t come close to describing how paralysing the cognitive symptoms can actually be. Cousins is now 29. She had just qualified for the British Olympic rowing team when she contracted Covid in March 2020 and subsequently developed long Covid and ME/CFS. The illness forced her to give up her rowing career. That hurt. But it wasn\u2019t the hardest part. \u201cI was in my mid-20s; I should have been in the prime of my health. But I spent them waiting for my body to recover. It wasn\u2019t just weeks or months \u2013 it was years, time I can never get back. It\u2019s the grief for a life that wasn\u2019t lived \u2013 the things I could have done, the people I could have met, the experiences I could have had.\u201d The researchers have now developed an online toolkit that makes body mapping accessible to more people, including those who are unable to leave their homes due to their illness. \u201cIn the coming year, we hope to hold regular online body mapping workshops,\u201d says Cousins. But can this tool actually improve the wellbeing of people with long Covid? Not in the sense that it will heal them, says Jokela-Pansini. But creative research methods such as body mapping allow patients to express themselves differently so that their families, friends and possibly even clinicians can better understand how they feel. \u201cI think such body maps have utility,\u201d says Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP in Manchester who was not involved in the research. \u201cAsking patients to record their symptoms can be helpful not only for the individual, but it could also be useful to show the body map to a GP and say: \u2018This is where all my symptoms are.\u2019 That then allows them to discuss each body area and symptom and come up with a management plan.\u201d In addition, body maps may give patients more credibility. \u201cMany people with long Covid struggle with family members not believing them,\u201d says Chew-Graham. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just healthcare professionals who can gaslight patients, it\u2019s also partners and family members.\u201d This can be especially true in some ethnic minority groups where fatigue is often stigmatised, as Chew-Graham recently found in a study. The sense of not feeling worthy of care, as well as low awareness of available support, presents barriers in sufferers of long Covid seeking help. Jokela-Pansini considers it crucial to include patients from ethnic minorities in future studies. \u201cWe have a lot of data for white middle-class women, but we don\u2019t have much information about women with migrant backgrounds.\u201d When an illness so thoroughly disrupts everyday life, it is all the more important to take a holistic view of it. Social scientists, biomedical researchers, clinicians, patients and carers all have a part to play: \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at all these different layers, because each one of them contributes to a better understanding of post-infectious disease.\u201d",

Such a withdrawal, promised on the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, would in effect cut the multilateral agency\u2019s funding by one-fifth. The severe cut would be uncharted territory for the WHO, potentially curtailing public health works globally, pressuring the organization to attract private funding, and providing an opening for other countries to influence the organization. Other countries are not expected to make up the funding loss. The WHO works to improve the health of millions of people globally \u2013 from working to eradicate polio and tuberculosis to coordinating US HIV and Aids prevention work in Africa. \u201cThere are many influential people around him that say he\u2019ll announce the withdrawal on day one in office,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, a global health law expert at Georgetown University who opposes US withdrawal from the WHO, said. \u201cThe threat is real, it\u2019s palpable and it\u2019s likely.\u201d The WHO has declined to comment on any potential preparations for such a move. In a press conference on Thursday, a WHO spokesperson, Dr Margaret Harris, told reporters: \u201cThis is a government in transition, and as a government in transition they need the time and space to make their own decisions, to make that transition. And we are not going to make any comment further.\u201d The same day, the WHO made an \u201cemergency appeal\u201d for funds, citing the threats of climate breakdown and conflict to world health.

The independent Swiss entity was established during the pandemic to raise funds from \u201cnon-state actors\u201d, including wealthy individuals and corporations. The foundation was announced in May 2020, the same month that President-elect last threatened to withdraw US funding from the WHO. \u201cThe WHO plays a critical role in global health security, disease outbreaks and eradication, international emergencies, and mobilization of global cooperation,\u201d Anil Soni, CEO of the WHO Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThe Organization is critical in protecting US business interests worldwide. Its programs in disease surveillance, outbreak response, and pandemic preparedness help prevent disruptions to supply chains, international markets, and trade. No other organization has the capacity and bandwidth to coordinate international rapid response efforts, to share medical research and innovation, and to disseminate critical intelligence worldwide.\u201d Past WHO Foundation donors include the global food giant Nestl\u00e9, the makeup company Maybelline and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The foundation has granted anonymity to some donors, a practice which academics criticize as making it difficult to spot conflicts of interest. An arm of the United Nations, the US helped found WHO in 1948 through a joint resolution of Congress. The US remains its largest funder, providing about 22% of all member states\u2019 assessed contributions. The US is the only member state that can withdraw from the agency. The US provided $1.2bn to WHO in 2023 \u2013 a fraction of the federal government\u2019s $6.1tn budget and about what Joe Biden spent in one round of student loan debt relief in 2024. Although the US is legally required to provide written notice of intent to withdraw one year before taking any action, legal experts worry WHO funding could, in practical terms, disappear virtually overnight. Sign up to Headlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Trump\u2019s renewed efforts to withdraw funding and support from the WHO were first reported in December \u2013 one of many potential day-one actions. Like much of Trump\u2019s health policy agenda, the pandemic haunts the promise. Trump argued WHO was overly deferential to the Chinese government during the pandemic, and announced he would withdraw the US in May 2020. \u201cThe world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,\u201d Trump said in a Rose Garden speech in May 2020 announcing his plan to withdraw. \u201cCountless lives have been taken, and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision was rendered moot when Biden won the election in 2020, and promptly reversed course. Gostin sees no such reprieve in the upcoming administration. \u201cThis time he has four years to accomplish this goal,\u201d said Gostin. Resentment against the WHO has simmered in Republican circles since the pandemic. Some conservatives accuse the agency of threatening US sovereignty in a new pandemic treaty, which seeks to distribute vaccines equitably around the world. The first Covid-19 vaccine was released in the US in December 2020. Much of the global south lacked vaccines for years afterward, even as wealthy countries stockpiled doses. Ironically, legal experts worry that withdrawing the US from the WHO would provide an open door for Chinese government influence, a country Trump views as one of the US\u2019s chief global rivals. Experts say withdrawing from the WHO could also harm US national security interests by cutting off access to programs such as pandemic preparedness and seasonal influenza strain sequencing (used to develop annual flu shots).",

        "title": "Flea treatments are turning our pets into an environmental hazard \u2013 there has to be a better way | Sophie Pavelle | The Guardian",
        "text": "Startling evidence of the dangers to birds and rivers from over-the-counter drugs should be a wake-up call for owners to press for alternatives When I was 10, I succeeded in my campaign for a family dog. Part of her care, and our joy as owners, was the monthly application of spot-on worm and flea treatment. With veterinary medicine on my mind as a career, I relished the theatre of vets-at-home. We bought doses over the counter, scheduling the dog\u2019s treatment on the calendar like a five-a-side. We applied these drugs to our dog because every other owner did. Because it was encouraged, because it was easy, because it felt right. New research confirms the use of such veterinary drugs as an unmanned checkpoint in the landscape of environmental contamination. Put simply, caring for our dog was polluting the natural world. A study from the University of Sussex reveals songbirds as the latest victims. Blue tits and great tits are two of many birds that line their nests with animal fur. Every sampled nest contained fipronil and 89% contained imidacloprid and permethrin \u2013 three insecticides so potent they have been banned for agricultural use in the UK and EU, but can be bought by anyone for use on pets. In the study, nest mortality correlated with drug concentration. Eggs never hatched; chicks expired after hatching \u2013 at a time when almost half of all UK bird species are in a state of serious decline. \u201cThe simplest explanation is that eggs and chicks are getting a sufficient dose of pesticide from the nest lining to kill. There\u2019s enough medication in the environment to pollute every single blue and great tit nest,\u201d says Prof Dave Goulson, a co-author of the study. Bird nest pollution mirrors the state of our rivers. Studies by Dr Rosemary Perkins found fipronil persists in 99% of samples taken from 20 English rivers, with imidacloprid found in 66% of samples. My dog was one of the approximately 17.5 million cats and dogs in the UK \u2013 about 80% of the total of 22 million \u2013 that get regular over-the-counter worm and flea treatment, whether suffering from an infestation or not. One flea treatment of a medium-sized dog contains enough pesticide to kill 60 million bees. Will it take the silence of vanishing biodiversity for us to hear nature\u2019s cry? Goulson is one of many scientists warning of collateral damage from veterinary drugs, but a regulatory blind spot has kept the environmental repercussions largely hidden \u2013 hushed like an interruption. Pet medications aren\u2019t subject to the same risk assessments as they are for use on livestock. When flea treatments entered the market in the 1990s, their environmental impact was assumed trivial. I sense the veterinary profession has been caught off-guard by this ethical battle of balancing pet health with environmental responsibility. \u201cIt\u2019s a real dilemma,\u201d says Dr Sean McCormack, a small animal vet and conservationist. \u201cAs a vet, you\u2019ve taken an oath to \u2018protect and enhance animal welfare\u2019. But you\u2019re contaminating nature \u2013 how did we miss this?\u201d Pets aren\u2019t the only source. A recent study shows that handwashing by owners in the weeks after spot-on treatment is also a major contributor. And McCormack describes the down-the-drain pathway of fipronil administered in \u201cinsane quantities\u201d across equestrian facilities to protect hooves and fetlocks against feather mites. Horses return to muddy fields, and fipronil leaches into water and soil, fast and unseen. Vets find themselves in a tough position. They are constrained by the absence of viable alternatives, the expectations of millions of pet owners trying to do the right thing, and the biological phenomenon of the flea. Flea infestations can be fatal, and effective flea treatments must eliminate more than 90% of fleas in the environment. Otherwise, their staggering reproductive rate \u2013 a flea can lay 50 eggs a day \u2013 makes control nigh impossible. Fleas spend most of their life cycle away from their host, making eradication even more challenging. As for alternatives, flea collars and oral tablets generally contain many of the same harmful chemicals as spot-on treatments. Alternative chemical treatments are either potent toxins or essential oils with no proven efficacy. There is a serious economic argument to lessen animal medication overall. \u201cWe could probably remove 80-90% of any of these chemicals with immediate effect,\u201d says Goulson, who also rightly challenges our bewildering, increasing obsession with pets. Reducing pet medication could structure a case-by-case approach. \u201cMost practices are improving \u2013 tailoring application schedules to suit the individual pet and owner\u2019s lifestyle,\u201d says McCormack. If the dog is allergic to fleas, they should be prescribed monthly treatment. But treatment shouldn\u2019t be preventive. You wouldn\u2019t treat an empty scalp for head lice, and the same goes for fleas: if there is no infestation, keep a lid on it. We should also welcome recommendations to bond with our pets through husbandry, attentiveness on walks and home hygiene. Regular grooming can detect parasites early, allowing for reactive treatment. Washing pet bedding in hot water every few weeks and vacuuming sleeping areas help eliminate flea eggs and larvae that live there. And if your pet does require treatment? \u201cPlease don\u2019t let them enter watercourses at all,\u201d McCormack implores, citing further work from Goulson\u2019s lab that observed lethal doses of medication washing off dogs 28 days after application. How does that measure up to brand advice on the back of the packet? Most recommend a mere \u201c48 to 72 hours\u201d of water abstinence after treatment. Pharmaceutical companies place poison in the palm of our hands. Veterinary surgeon Dr Claire Whittle works with farmers to treat livestock strategically, and argues that spring is the perfect time to broach the conversation about using less medication with your vet. And countryside management like rotational grazing and taller grasses can be as effective at reducing parasite exposure as some pesticides. Native species such as sainfoin and chicory not only pose a structural challenge for parasites, but they contain natural insecticides. \u201cDiversifying plants could be better for animal health as well as wildlife health. Medication should not be the first line of defence,\u201d says Whittle. Looking ahead, parasites are evolving with worsening climate breakdown, spreading new disease risks. But on the brighter side, some countries are improving regulation. Ireland is making flea and worm treatments prescription only, offering a valuable case study for future policy changes in the UK. Could this spur urgent cooperation between industry regulators, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, pharmaceutical companies and the pet-owning public? Protecting our pets should never come at the cost of protecting nature. And I worry this uniquely human business of eliminating parasites, mixed with private sector procrastination to find and fund regulated, alternative veterinary medication, risks us morphing into the most hedonistic parasite of all. But parasites have little to gain from killing their host. They must keep them alive, in symbiosis. There is power for change, in our poisonous hands.

        "text": "2024 YR4, a lump of rock the size of a building, may be heading our way, but don\u2019t start stockpiling the tinned carrots yet Following the possible trajectory of 2024 YR4 \u2013 AKA the scariest asteroid ever detected \u2013 is not for the nervous of disposition. Is it going to hit us, or not? Every day, a different answer. Last Tuesday, Nasa calculated it had a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, and so some people set to worrying. Twenty-four hours later, however, the agency provided an update. New observations, made since the passing of the full moon, show it now has a 1.5% chance of impact. Time to exhale? Not necessarily. The asteroid is estimated to be 40-90 metres wide, about the same size as a large building. If it does hit, and doesn\u2019t splash down into the sea, it could decimate a city. Scientists calculate that its impact could be similar to that of the Tunguska asteroid, which flattened an area more than double the size of New York in Siberian forest in 1908. If it landed in central London, windows 20 miles away in Slough would be broken \u2013 an event that would exceed the wildest dreams even of John Betjeman, who once wrote a rather mean poem about the town. How to feel about this lump of rock hurtling towards us at 38,000mph? To pinch from The Simpsons Movie, is it the pub or the church for you? (Faced with catastrophe, the patrons of Moe\u2019s Tavern run from bar to church, while the congregation of the latter sprints in the opposite direction, desperate for a stiff drink.) Most of us will keep calm and carry on, whatever the percentages. Seven years is a long time: you\u2019ll be a size 10 by then \u2013 that, or getting\u00a0divorced. The key thing about Armageddon is that it\u2019s always in the future, as the followers of myriad cults have found to their cost down the years. Let us trust the experts \u2013 remember them? \u2013 to sort it out. A few years ago, Nasa significantly changed the orbit of an asteroid. The Dart spacecraft slammed into a 150-metre asteroid moon at speed, changing its orbital period by more than 30 minutes \u2013 a result that could be replicated, if planning began now. A few, should the predictions get worse, may go full survivalist, filling their bunkers with tinned carrots. But their number will be small. The news cycle is hardly relaxing at the moment, the old order as frangible as digestive biscuits. A person has the capacity for only so much terror,\u00a0and now may not be the time\u00a0to start worrying what will happen to Birmingham if YR4 turns out to be\u00a0West Midlands-bound. The year 1998 came with its share\u00a0of global calamities, but the notion of a world war seemed far away compared with today, which may be one reason why two big films about asteroids then played to packed cinemas. In Deep Impact, a comet on a collision course with Earth hits, causing a tsunami that destroys the US east coast, a mission by the Messiah spacecraft having failed to alter its path. In Armageddon, a rogue asteroid is broken into fragments by a nuclear bomb that is somehow inserted into it by, among others, an oil driller played by Bruce Willis \u2013 though it\u2019s not all good news: Shanghai is obliterated by another meteor strike along the way.

        "title": "The chances of this asteroid hitting Earth keep rising. But there are four reasons I\u2019m not worried yet | Carrie Nugent | The Guardian",
        "text": "Scientists are closely monitoring 2024 YR4 \u2013 and while it\u2019s relatively small, it reminds us of the dangers lurking in space Two days after Christmas, the Atlas sky survey team discovered a new rocky object in Earth\u2019s astronomical neighbourhood. Atlas discovers near-Earth objects all the time: in 2024, the team discovered 167 of them. They also codiscovered comet Tsuchinshan\u2013Atlas, which dazzled sky gazers last autumn. But this discovery was special: there\u2019s a chance the 40-90 metre object, known as 2024 YR4, will hit Earth in 2032. In January, the impact probability was estimated to be just over 1%, then it was raised to 2.3% in early February. As of this week, the Nasa JPL Center for Near Earth Object Studies has raised that to 3.1% \u2013 or about 1-in-32 chance of impact. There are four reasons I\u2019m not worried just yet. First, the possible impact would be in December 2032, so we\u2019ve got time to prepare. Second, the asteroid is likely not terribly large by asteroid standards. The little asteroid that unexpectedly exploded over Chelyabinsk in Russia, causing damage but no deaths in 2013, was roughly 20 metres across \u2013 2024 YR4 is bigger than that but still vastly smaller than the 10km-diameter object that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. If 2024 YR4 hits, it would cause regional, not global, destruction. And with years to prepare, people have time to evacuate the area. Which brings us to the third reason not to panic \u2013 the surface of the Earth is mostly water. And although asteroid-tsunami studies could use more research, I think most experts would agree that a 40- to 90-metre asteroid-ocean impact could happen without loss to human life or property. Fourth, we are still gathering data on this object. The impact probabilities come from specialists using computer software to figure out where 2024 YR4 might go. The timing here is important. For an asteroid to hit the Earth, you don\u2019t just need the asteroid\u2019s orbit and the Earth\u2019s orbit to cross. You need both Earth and the asteroid to be in the same place in the solar system, at the same time. You can picture these trajectory predictions as a line of possibilities showing where the position of the asteroid might be in December 2032. Right now, 3.1% of the line overlaps the surface of the Earth. As astronomers gather more observations of this asteroid, they\u2019ll become more confident about what its path will be, and the line of possibilities will shrink. As the line shrinks, the Earth-overlapping portion becomes a larger fraction of it. That can make the impact probability go up \u2013 at first. This has happened before with newly discovered asteroids. But as more observations of those objects were made, the line continued to shrink. Eventually, only part, and then none, of the Earth was covered by the likely paths predicted in the line. When that happened, the impact probability rapidly dropped to zero. We will have to wait and see what happens to 2024 YR4\u2019s impact probability. Asteroid impacts are often represented, in media and literature, as a symbol of human powerlessness against the universe. But the reality is quite different. A few years ago, Nasa significantly changed the orbit of an asteroid. The Dart spacecraft slammed into a 150-metre asteroid moon at tremendous speed, changing its orbital period by more than 30 minutes. And although every impact scenario is unique, that\u2019s a promising result \u2013 it\u2019s enough of a kick to knock many objects off course, causing them to miss Earth. However, the remaining time before 2024 YR4\u2019s possible impact is extremely tight to fund, build and launch such a complex spacecraft. There\u2019s a community of astronomers, software engineers, citizen scientists and civil servants who spend their days discovering and keeping tabs on every single one of the almost 38,000 known asteroids and comets that pass through near-Earth space. Nasa\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office and the European Space Agency\u2019s Planetary Defence Office, which have similar goals even if they disagree on spelling, have been working with governments and the UN, preparing for something just like this. Each night, telescopic surveys such as Atlas discover near-Earth objects. These surveys send their observations to the Minor Planet Center in Massachusetts, which checks them for accuracy and publishes them. This allows other people to point their telescopes at the right part of the sky, at the right time, and get the follow-up observations that secure an orbit. In the case of 2024 YR4, observations have poured in from all over the world \u2013 from Kansas, London, Ukraine and China, just to name a few. This collective gathering and publishing of observations allows trajectory-prediction groups in the US and Europe to keep tabs on the new discoveries to see if any have a chance of hitting Earth. 2024 YR4 is worth keeping an eye on. Right now, it\u2019s pretty faint, and the full moon has been flooding the night sky with light, making it tough to track. Over the coming months, expect to see more observations coming in, including ones from the James Webb space telescope. These observations will tell us more about the object\u2019s size and where exactly it\u2019s headed. But this smaller object should be a reminder of the bigger near-Earth objects out there. Very roughly, there\u2019s a one in 350 chance that a much larger asteroid \u2013 140 metres across or larger \u2013 will hit Earth in your lifetime. This is much more likely than the one in 17,000 chance you have of being struck by lightning. Personally, I\u2019m thankful that the asteroid surveys regularly scan the night sky with their telescopes, keeping watch.

        "title": "A perfect boiled egg in 32 minutes? Don\u2019t let science ruin the joyful imperfection of home cooking  | Alicia Kennedy | The Guardian",
        "text": "Yes, I\u2019ve made balsamic vinegar pearls and sous-vide swede \u2013 but trial and error still produces the most delicious food To make pearls of balsamic vinegar, first chill a good amount of olive oil in a tall glass. While it waits in the fridge, in a small saucepan over a medium heat, bring the vinegar and agar-agar to the beginning of a boil \u2013 just until the agar-agar has dissolved. Let this mixture cool, remove the oil from the fridge, and use a pipette to drop balls of the agar-stiffened vinegar into the oil to form the pearls. Drain into another container using a small sieve to catch the pearls. Reserve the oil for another use. I remember making these, my first and only foray into what is known as \u201cmolecular gastronomy\u201d, in 2013. It was already a bit passe at that time, but the science experiment aspect of creating a simple acidic garnish for a chocolate and strawberry cupcake that Valentine\u2019s Day was undoubtedly fun. The lesson influenced how I\u2019d go on to use agar-agar, a seaweed-derived vegan gelatin, in dishes like panna cotta or flan, but I never made the pearls again. They were a novelty, and now I have a fond memory of cosplaying as Ferran Adri\u00e0, a Spanish chef who popularised these sorts of processes through the restaurant El Bulli. The pearls came to mind while reading about an experiment conducted by Ernesto Di Maio at the University of Naples in Italy. His team found that if you swap an egg between boiling water and 30C water every two minutes for eight cycles, totalling 32 minutes, the egg will be perfectly evenly cooked between white and yolk. New Scientist reported on this finding rather credulously, as though home cooks are truly perplexed about how to boil an egg to their liking. Rather than cooking science that\u2019s about making something pretty and fun, like the vinegar pearls, this experiment was about making an instance of everyday cooking labour intensive, water-wasteful and time-consuming. I could see someone doing this experiment once, the way I made the vinegar pearls, and then going back to their tried-and-true method. (For what it\u2019s worth, dropping eggs into already boiling water and letting them cook for seven minutes is how I get my preferred texture of jammy orange yolk.) In the long history of the relationship between cooking and chemistry, there\u2019s often been this kind of push-pull between what is actually going to enliven and enlighten a home cook, and a pursuit of perfection \u2013 whether in technique and taste or in nutrition. Indeed, cuisine in the US throughout the early part of the 20th century was defined by a divide between gourmands, who were interested in food and wine for the pleasure it gave them, and the \u201cscientific cooks\u201d, who were obsessed with eating as a means of ingesting the proper amount of vitamins, minerals and calories without any interest in the joys of the table. \u201cFood science\u201d differs from the restaurant-driven style of molecular cooking because it\u2019s usually focused on nutrition, flavour chemistry and shelf stability to the most common ends of creating industrial products. Molecular gastronomy, a term coined in 1988 by Hungarian-born British physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Herv\u00e9 This, has been focused on culinary applications of scientific principles and processes: sous-vide cooking a steak by sealing it in a vacuum bag and cooking it slowly in a water bath; using liquid nitrogen to create a carrot foam; or transforming the texture of olive juice through spherification. These techniques were popularised through El Bulli, Wylie Dufresne\u2019s New York City restaurant wd~50, and Grant Achatz\u2019s Chicago restaurant Alinea \u2013 and the latter is the only one of these still open and wowing diners with apple candy filled with helium that arrives to the table in the form of a balloon. (I\u2019ve eaten there, and it inspired me to sous-vide slices of rutabaga \u2013 swede \u2013 again, just once.) Rather than these kinds of perhaps gimmicky tasting-menu ideas, \u201cinnovation\u201d in food these days tends to come in forms that are focused on an ideally sustainable future: plant-based faux meats; chef-driven proprietary seed companies like Dan Barber\u2019s Row 7; or strawberries grown indoors year-round by the company Oishii. These are more in line with what food science has always been about, which is precision, uniformity and replication: products that can scale and turn a profit, but retain the culinary considerations learned from molecular gastronomy. If there is to be a scientific touch to food, it\u2019s come to be understood that there should be an element of that higher-minded gastronomic purpose afoot in order to convince people of its worth. While it\u2019s always been fun to mix scientific approaches with home cooking, what worries me about a focus on \u201cinnovation\u201d for the sake of a \u201cperfect\u201d squash or strawberry, a profit-driven soy patty, or new techniques for simple things like boiling eggs is that they could have the effect of deterring people from cooking. Learning how to pick fruit or vegetables at the market and getting into the kitchen to cook them will always be acts of trial and error, and they should be fun. Cooking is an experiment, every day, in how water, oil, salt and so many other elements can come together for the purpose of making something delicious. But unlike a laboratory or a factory, the result doesn\u2019t need to be the same every single time, or held to a precise scientific standard. Weather, moods and attention all influence how a human cooks \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot to enjoy in the imperfections.

        "title": "Sex 20 times a week? New study identifies four types of romantic lover | Relationships | The Guardian",
        "text": "Australian research is \u2018first to empirically show that we don\u2019t all love the same\u2019, lead author says New research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week. The research, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic. Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as \u201ca motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual\u201d \u2013 and one \u201cthat arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans\u201d. \u201cIt occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.\u201d Bode said that definition was \u201cnot perfect\u201d but was \u201cthe scientifically most useful and most precise\u201d. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have all its features until puberty\u201d, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship. According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes in hormones and blood neurotransmitter levels and is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to \u201ccompanionate love\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In some cases it persists longer. Bode said this was \u201cthe first paper to empirically show that we don\u2019t all love the same\u201d. \u201cThat seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn\u2019t shown it before,\u201d he said. The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used the Romantic Love Survey 2022 of 1,556 people, the world\u2019s largest dataset of people in love. This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode\u2019s team identified four major \u201cclusters\u201d. Mild: About one in five \u2013 20.02% \u2013 fell into this cluster, characterised by \u201cthe lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex\u201d. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was \u201cdefinitely\u201d in love with them \u2013 just 25.31% \u2013 and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%. Moderate: About four in 10 \u2013 40.91% \u2013 landed in this category, which Bode described as \u201cfairly stock-standard\u201d \u2013 or in the words of the journal article, \u201centirely unremarkable\u201d. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had \u201crelatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex\u201d. Intense: This category described about one in three \u2013 29.42% \u2013 of survey respondents, who Bode described as \u201ccrazy in-love\u201d types. They were characterised by \u201cthe highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex\u201d. About six in 10 people in this group were female. Libidinous: About one in 10 \u2013 9.64% \u2013 were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as \u201crelatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex\u201d. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together. The team\u2019s research measured people\u2019s romantic intensity, obsessive thinking, commitment and sexual frequency to come up with the categories. Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money. The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a \u201crobust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love\u201d used cross-culturally, developed in 1986. The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by \u201cwhatever they thought it meant\u201d). The authors of the new study suggested it might \u201cbe fruitful\u201d to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality. The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries. \u201cRomantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,\u201d Bode said. \u201cThese findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love. \u201cHumans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].\u201d",

        "title": "Shortsighted Taiwan may have lessons for the world as a preventable disease skyrockets | Taiwan | The Guardian",
        "text": "Up to 90% of young people in Taiwan have myopia but eye experts say the growing global trend can be reversed In the final days of their eight-week bootcamp, dozens of young Taiwanese conscripts are being tested on an obstacle course. The men in full combat kit are crawling underneath rows of razor wire and through bunkers as controlled explosions blast columns of dirt into the air. Pink and green smoke blooms in a simulated gas attack, requiring the conscripts to quickly don gas masks so they can rush the zone. But it\u2019s here where many of them pause, stopping the assault drill to spend precious seconds removing their glasses so the masks will fit. The conscripts mostly look to be in their early 20s. Statistics suggest that means anywhere up to 90% of them have some degree of myopia, otherwise known as shortsightedness. Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of myopia, alongside most of east Asia and Singapore. As well as the platoons of soldiers in spectacles, there are plenty of other signs. Optometry shops are everywhere \u2013 just around Taipei there are more than 40 outlets of Own Days, a chain which tests customers\u2019 eyesight and makes prescription eyewear on-site within an hour. Laser eye surgeons advertise the latest tech, relatively cheaply, to a virtual production line of patients each day. And if you were to visit the front desk of a hospital in Taiwan, instead of pens chained to the counter, you\u2019d probably find a pair of glasses. \u201cEye health is the most important sensory organ in our body. Every day we wake up and need to use our eyes,\u201d says Dr Wu Pei-chang, a leading Taiwanese researcher of the subject and director of the Myopia Treatment and Prevention Center at Kaohsiung hospital. Myopia is a preventable disease in which abnormal elongation of the eyeball causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of on its surface. The distortion level is measured in diopters, and high myopia (when the distortion has progressed past -5.00 diopters) can lead to blindness if left untreated. The most crucial time is childhood, while a child\u2019s eyes are still developing. \u201cOnce they onset myopia the progression is very fast,\u201d says Wu. For decades science said myopia was a genetic condition, but from the 1960s and 70s an explosion in rates in east Asian countries \u2013 which were concurrently undergoing massive economic and educational expansion \u2013 upended that thinking. By the 1990s rates of myopia in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore had risen from about 20% to more than 80%. China, initially delayed by the Cultural Revolution, soon joined them. Governments studied the phenomenon extensively, but it turned out to be quite simple. Myopia is now known to be linked to excessive \u201cnearwork\u201d, like reading, studying and computer work. And more recent studies have found that increased outdoor time is a crucial protective factor. That\u2019s why scientists say the rates are so high in east Asia and Singapore, where the cultures heavily emphasise high educational outcomes, with extensive study time favoured by parents over outdoor play. It\u2019s now a problem that is spreading around the world. A study published in September in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found global rates of myopia tripled between 1990 and 2023. By 2050, almost half the world\u2019s population is projected to have it, with corresponding earlier onset, faster progression and greater severity. Taiwan\u2019s rates are still high but government and social programs have shown measurable success and experts say it is well past its peak. As rates rise in the west, it may have lessons to share. Wu, himself shortsighted, was a young resident when he started to notice an alarming number of his patients and colleagues also had myopia, with many facing serious complications of the disease\u2019s advanced progression. It became his life\u2019s work. In 2004 a paper found that high myopia was the number one cause of irreversible blindness in Taiwan. Lobbied by Wu, who was now on national advisory boards, the government enacted new policies including twice-yearly testing of school students, and improved treatment options. But the rates were still increasing. \u201cThe eyes are developing rapidly [in childhood],\u201d says Prof Ian Morgan, a leading expert in the field, from Australian National University. \u201cThe myopia has until around the age of 18 to 20 before it stabilises. So if a kid becomes myopic at the age of six, they still have about 14 years for it to get worse.\u201d A few years later, two studies \u2013 including one from Australia led by Morgan \u2013 offered a lightbulb moment for Taiwan. Both found that the more time kids spent outdoors, the less likely they were to have myopia. Wu ran his own trials, finding similar results. It led to a 2010 government initiative \u201cTian-tian 120\u201d (120 every day), calling for all children to spend at least two hours outside a day as a \u201cprotective factor\u201d. \u201cIt was actually very simple \u2013 [the problem was] that myopia has a protective factor and a risk factor, but we had only been focusing on the risk factor,\u201d says Wu. The outdoor time reversed myopia\u2019s upward trend, bringing the rate among primary schoolchildren from more than 50% down to 45% within a few years. In Yilan, a 2014 community program achieved about a 50% reduction at the preschool level. Researchers were emboldened. They had found a way to slow the onset of myopia, allowing children to reach the crucial stage of adulthood with minimal progression of the disease. But they had to convince parents and schools to ease up on the homework time. Taiwanese statistics show myopia appears to significantly worsen at the times when students move to new school stages with sudden increases in study load. A 2017 study found the rate of myopia increased from 9% to 19.8% between the ages of six and seven, when children start first grade, while high myopia increased by more than 50% between 6th and 7th grade. At a junior high school in central Taipei, dozens of 8th grade students are lined up outside the school clinic for their twice-yearly check. If any show signs of myopia, the two staff nurses will send a letter home to the parents within days, with requests to show proof of medical follow-ups within a fortnight. There are also growing concerns about the impact of screen time, which is rising globally. Last week a Korean study found every hour of screen time raised the chances of myopia among children. Hong Kong primary students \u2013 who spent much of the Covid pandemic doing online learning \u2013 more than tripled the averages hours they spent on screens each day, SCMP reported in 2023. In the same period, rates of myopia went up 2.5 times, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In China\u2019s Shandong province, Wu says, the rate among six- and seven-year-olds jumped from about 5% to 25%. Rates in Taiwan are still high but Morgan and Wu say the peak is over and Taiwan is on the way to bringing rates down. Government data is frustratingly scant, but Wu says he is finalising a 10-year study that is suggesting the prevalence is now \u201cdown very low\u201d from a decade ago. At the Taipei junior high school, the teachers estimate their students get probably 60 minutes of outdoor time during school hours, and maybe another 30 on their way home. But as the kids move up grades, \u201cthe pressure to study increases\u201d. Asked where the pressure is still coming from \u2013 the school, parents or peers \u2013 the teachers laugh. \u201cEverywhere.\u201d Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu",

        "title": "Five years on from the pandemic, how has Covid changed our world? | Stephen Reicher, Rachel Clarke, Rafael Behr,  Frances Ryan and others | The Guardian",
        "text": "We asked a group of experts on politics, trade, literature, psychology, work and more: what has been the most surprising or shocking consequence of Covid-19 in your field? Stephen Reicher Professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy Great calamities often provoke reflections about the human condition. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 led people to reconsider their relationship with God, and compelled Voltaire to viciously lampoon Leibniz\u2019s notion that we live in the best of all possible worlds. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic forced people to rethink how they relate to the natural world, inspiring a new style of architecture, a new appreciation of the outdoors, and a range of back-to-nature movements. And Covid \u2026 ? Well, judging by the coverage of the inquiry so far, the big issues seem to be how government figures used WhatsApp and who uttered which obscenity about whom. But despite this masterclass in trivialisation, Covid did have something profound to teach us about the relationship of individuals to society. For nearly two centuries, since the spectacular growth of cities sparked by the advent of industrialisation, western social thought has been obsessed with how to maintain control.Once people were concentrated together and physically separated from their erstwhile masters, would they still respect the old hierarchies? Or would they join together to dismantle them? This was reflected in a profound fear of the masses, particularly of crowds. The social elites lived in perpetual fear of the howling mobs. The outcome was a pervasive pessimism about the popular psyche and an entrenched anti-collectivism. This still dominates my discipline, psychology. It is reflected in the notion that human reasoning, at best, is inherently flawed, and that the flaws are accentuated when we act in groups. Such views are popular in government, and they shaped the initial response to Covid \u2013 with disastrous consequences. Remember \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d \u2013 the notion that people would lack the psychological resilience to cope with stringent measures? This contributed to the delay of the first lockdown. Yet concerns that the masses wouldn\u2019t measure up were ill-founded. The common threat of Covid led people to develop a shared identity based around community. People became more concerned about the fate of others, which was reflected in enduring levels of adherence to stringent restrictions \u2013 even though, by following the lockdown rules, many suffered considerable hardships. Resilience, it turned out, was not something people lacked, but something that arises when people think and act as a group. For many, though, that realisation came too late. It has been estimated that, had Britain locked down a week earlier, it could have saved more than 30,000 people. Two weeks, and up to 40,000 more people would have survived. The cost of pessimistic individualism was ultimately measured in tens of thousands of lives. The Covid response of the UK government was shot through with the notion that we, the people, were very much part of the problem. Disdain was the defining feature of the Johnson government\u2019s approach, visible in his refusal to be candid about the challenges we faced, in the policy of blame and punishment for those breaking the rules, and in the government\u2019s refusal to engage with communities and provide them with the resources they needed to comply with the rules. It was perhaps best encapsulated by Matt Hancock\u2019s explanation for why the government repeatedly refused calls to increase support for self-isolation: because people would game the system. The story of Covid is one of an opportunity missed through ideological myopia. Far from being a problem, the public were the best asset the government had in dealing with the pandemic. Rather than harnessing that asset, ministers ignored and undermined it. They did so precisely because of their fear of the masses. So, for me, the big issue to come out of Covid is the need to rethink the relationship between the individual and the collective. Far from eroding our rationality, the group empowers us, makes us agents of our own fate and provides resilience in hard times. If we don\u2019t understand that, we will have learned nothing from Covid, and the next pandemic response will be as much of a shambles as the last. Sophie Mackintosh Author whose debut novel, The Water Cure, was longlisted for the 2018 Booker prize It\u2019s been five years since the start of the Covid pandemic, and yet there have been few novels grappling explicitly with its impact. Earlier this year I was speaking to the Norwegian author Helga Flatland about her novel Toxic, at the Kerala literature festival.\u00a0It struck me that hers was one of the few books I\u2019ve read that firmly locates itself in that specific era. The events are set in motion by the first lockdowns: the protagonist moves from Oslo to the countryside, and the novel is punctuated with Zoom calls, bubbles and online classes. In Toxic the pandemic is present, rather than viewed from a distance. But then, where are the big novels reflecting on what the experience has taught us, shown us? Has it even taught us anything, seeing as it seems our position, as a society, is mostly one of denial? Talking about \u201cpandemic literature\u201d as a concept also makes it seem as if it\u2019s over, when the lives of many people continue to be irrevocably altered by Covid. There\u2019s a clear beginning, but no definitive ending. Five years, in this context, seems like no time at all. I spoke to my editor, Hermione Thompson, editorial director at Hamish Hamilton, who agreed that it just still might be too soon. \u201cWe start trying to make sense of an event from the moment it kicks off, and art which comes out of that white heat of experience can be incredibly powerful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to wait a bit longer \u2013 often a lot longer \u2013 for the wider picture to come into focus. And once you can see it, perhaps you have to wait a while more before you can bear to actually look at it.\u201d Her submission pile is full of escapist stories. Readers, she told me, perhaps want \u201cto be taken as far away as possible from the frightening prospect of reality\u201d. Perhaps it makes sense to think of Covid\u2019s impact on fiction as something more abstract. I\u2019ve come to see my third novel, Cursed Bread, as a pandemic novel of sorts, though it\u2019s set in 1950s France, against the background of a mass poisoning. This appealed at the time, allowing me to escape as I wrote it in a frantic burst of energy between January 2020 and January 2021. But you can\u2019t shut out the world entirely, and it was only afterwards that I saw obvious influences: a novel about desire in which the protagonist is hardly touched, the impact of collective trauma, a feverish claustrophobia. Thompson singled out Ali Smith\u2019s Companion Piece, and last year\u2019s Booker prize winner, Orbital, as standout novels inspired by the experience of lockdown. But my favourite Covid novel is Burntcoat by Sarah Hall \u2013 released in October 2021, a mere 18 months after that first lockdown. Eerily prescient in its portrayal of a virus that lingers in the body, it\u2019s also expansive, asking questions about art, love and creation in the face of disaster. Written in that aforementioned \u201cwhite heat\u201d, it didn\u2019t wait for the event to feel distant, but captured that strange time as it happened \u2013 and perhaps in that state of rawness yielded something that\u00a0felt more true and significant. Rafael Behr Guardian columnist and leader writer What politicians do is generally more important than where they do it. But the pandemic brought an unusual focus on the spaces where power is wielded \u2013 the rooms where stuff happened; how many people were there; whether what they were doing counted as work under lockdown regulations.\u00a0Those questions, and Boris Johnson\u2019s inability to give straight answers, ended up being more consequential for politics than the deadly effects of the virus itself. It was not the cost of bad decisions made in No 10 that brought down the prime minister, but the after-hours parties in the same building. Both failings were twin expressions of Johnson\u2019s disorderly character. A leader with an ethical compass who exuded professional discipline by day would not have generated a workplace culture that licensed rowdy piss-ups by night. Partygate was explosive because it made a mockery of millions of sacrifices by law-abiding citizens who had answered the call of duty to suspend their own needs, to forgo weddings, birthdays, funerals, in a communal struggle against the virus. It was the perfect scandal to mobilise resentment of a remote and arrogant political class that doesn\u2019t feel bound by rules it imposes on everyone else. This was hardly a new sentiment. But it was intensified by feelings of betrayal after the initial phase of the pandemic, which had been marked by a spirit of national solidarity. The prime minister benefited from that mood. His poll ratings were not dented by fatal early policy vacillations. His popularity peaked around the time that he was personally incapacitated by Covid. Johnson\u2019s landslide victory in the 2019 general election, on a pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, conveyed a strong public appetite for calmer, less ferociously partisan politics. The first lockdown effectively delivered just that. The enabling law \u2013 monumentally draconian for a democracy \u2013 was bundled through parliament in four days. The famously raucous Commons chamber was muted by social distancing strictures. Chronic dysfunction at the centre, wasteful misallocation of resources, lethal hesitation and divisions over strategy \u2013 these didn\u2019t go unreported. There were intimations of the coming unravelling, not least in the furore around Dominic Cummings\u2019s notorious excursion to Barnard Castle. Politics was not suspended. But it was muted for months. With Partygate, the staggering degeneracy of Johnson\u2019s regime was vomited before the public gaze. The scale of administrative dysfunction and the deficit of accountability were functions of a political culture that resists modernisation, venerates dilettantism and conflates rhetorical dexterity with judgment. When Britain needed serious, sober leadership, it found itself at the mercy of inadequate, clownish whimsy. That was a tragedy but not an accident; a feature of the system, not a bug. The debauching of Downing Street during lockdown was unlawful and the prime minister\u2019s dishonest denials put him in contempt of parliament. Those were the technical offences that finished his career. But the true penalty is still being paid by everyone else. It is measured in heightened cynicism and depleted trust in governing institutions that need to command public confidence for democracy to function. Laleh Khalili Professor of international politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of Sinews of War and Trade: Shipping and Capitalism in the Arabian Peninsula Suzhou, a city in eastern China, is where the world\u2019s technology is made. Its factories produce products for companies such as Foxconn and Samsung, and are staffed by millions of labourers, mostly migrant workers from rural China. In late January 2020, Suzhou\u2019s municipal government, following Beijing\u2019s orders, took the unprecedented step of extending the lunar new year holidays and delaying the return of migrant workers. Transport in and out of China slowed to a crawl. Factory towns, including Suzhou, closed. While media coverage of lockdowns focused on their human impact, the pandemic transformed supply chains, and had a huge impact on global trade. At sea, ships were in effect stranded; with ports closed, there was nowhere to dock their cargo. International maritime treaties dictate that seafarers shouldn\u2019t spend more than 11 continuous months at sea. According to the International Maritime Organization, the number of sailors working long after the end of their contracts rose to 400,000. Some remained on their ships for more than 22 months, wandering the world\u2019s seas with no end in sight. On land, last-mile logistics drivers delivering food and groceries were designated as frontline workers. In Britain, along with nurses and bus drivers, they were among the largest group of workers who became ill with Covid. Not everyone suffered from the effects of the virus. Shipping companies sought subsidies from governments, even as increased demand for goods meant their rates rose to their highest in history, netting them eye-watering profits. Because Chinese trade slowed, so too did the production, sale and export of personal protective equipment (PPE) beyond the Chinese border. Spying an opportunity, charlatans with excellent connections to the British government set up companies to provide PPE, and cleaned up on lucrative contracts for often defective or even nonexistent products. The week-long closure of the Suez canal in March 2021 by a ship run aground had little to do with Covid-19, but only confirmed the fragility of the ostensibly efficient and frictionless global logistical routes that defined our world. This realisation compelled some European and US corporations to shift their factories nearer to home, to the peripheries of Europe or the Mexican borderlands. The US had already been threatening a trade war with China long before the slowdown, and \u201cnearshoring\u201d neatly fitted with this new strategic posture. During his first term as president, Donald Trump blamed the pandemic on alleged biological warfare by the Chinese government. In his second term, some of the stories he spun back then can be marshalled for a new purpose. Capitalism\u2019s common features \u2013 the offshoring of industry, the outsourcing of labour and the skyrocketing costs of shipping \u2013 can now be blamed on a nefarious Chinese agenda. As Trump effects a flurry of executive orders implementing tariffs against China and many other trading partners, we\u2019re seeing the new era of trade that Covid helped to accelerate. Frances Ryan Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People My earliest memory is the tins of peas. A couple of weeks into the first Covid lockdown, I was getting used to being stuck at home 24/7. Like millions of other clinically vulnerable people, the shielding programme meant I wasn\u2019t even supposed to go to the shops for fruit and veg (or gin). In the back of the cupboard, I was relieved to find some vitamins and, with them, a shred of hope. It was a hard time for many, of course, but a few things made it easier. With theatres and the pub closed, entertainment was beamed remotely to our front rooms \u2013 access many disabled people had long dreamed of. At the same time, the public were taking Covid protections \u2013 from masks to testing \u2013 that helped keep those of us at high risk as safe as we could be. Five years on, I would like to say such progress continued but I think we all know that would be a lie. Remote access to social and cultural events has largely been revoked now non-disabled people no longer need it. While WFH has been normalised, it\u2019s repeatedly dismissed as an excuse to skive. Since the last legal Covid protections were removed in 2022, clinically vulnerable people have been left with the \u201cchoice\u201d of in effect shielding indefinitely or risking our lives each time we go out. Many disabled readers have told me they no longer feel able to do simple things like have a pint with a friend. Others with long Covid have lost jobs and relationships. The \u201creturn to normal\u201d did not include everyone. It isn\u2019t simply that the things that helped clinically vulnerable people to stay safe have gone \u2013 there\u2019s pushback to the idea that we even deserve them. Simply wearing a mask ourselves in 2025 \u2013 let alone asking someone else to \u2013 is enough to get yelled at by a stranger in Tesco. It feels at times as if the pandemic unmasked (no pun intended) a blend of denial and resentment towards disabled people, as if our needs are simultaneously a reminder of a time society would rather forget, and evidence of a sense of entitlement from an uppity minority. As one district nurse told me last year when I asked if she would mind testing for Covid before she came to my home if I gave her a lateral flow test: \u201cIt isn\u2019t for people like you to tell us what to do.\u201d Whether it\u2019s anger over the benefits bill or a bus having a priority wheelchair space, there\u2019s a longstanding prejudice that disabled people are costly and demanding when all we are asking is to be able to live. In that way, the pandemic didn\u2019t change negative attitudes towards disability \u2013 it just exacerbated them. It\u2019s natural to want to gain from a bad situation, as if all the pain wasn\u2019t for nothing. Perhaps, though, real progress comes in being honest: in saying we tried for equality and solidarity but fell short. It is only in admitting our shortcomings as a country that we will ever do better for disabled people \u2013 to figuratively dig in the back of the cupboard together and find the peas. William Davies Sociologist and political economist. His latest book is Unprecedented? How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy From time to time, a student contacts me having found a relic from the 2020-2021 academic year. Not some social distancing tool, although campuses still have plastic screens that haven\u2019t yet been disposed of, or the bits of gaffer tape on carpet that students were instructed not to cross. No, these students have come across some actual treasure: a lecture video, still stored in the cloud, but no longer accessible. The question is: since they can\u2019t attend a lecture, can I release the video instead? There are usually practical reasons why not. Lectures change from year to year. But the bigger question this poses is what is the case for in-person attendance in the first place? Universities made it through the pandemic thanks to digital platforms and \u201cedtech\u201d. The difficulty is how to put the genie back in the bottle, and resuscitate what made a campus a valuable space of congregation in the first place. As in schools, falling student attendance levels are one of the many scars left by Covid-19. Putting the other mental-health legacies of lockdowns to one side for a moment, they also triggered a social crisis: for a period of time, it became possible, necessary and \u2013 to some extent \u2013 convenient to live your life from your bedroom. With that option established, busy corridors, lecture halls and conversational seminars may seem confusing and sometimes even threatening. What\u2019s more, there is no question that for a generation raised with YouTube and smartphones it makes perfect sense to \u201cconsume\u201d a lecture at the time, place and even speed of one\u2019s choosing. Note-taking can become verbatim with the availability of closed captioning. How does a university or individual lecturer stand in the way of this without merely seeming conservative or obstructive? There are plenty of valid benefits of a thriving campus and classroom, such as forging identities, making friends or participating in sports and political campaigns. Universities are now at pains to emphasise these, seeking to make their campuses more \u201csticky\u201d via the introduction of additional cafes, social spaces and gyms. But at some point, the pedagogical question needs to be confronted: why can\u2019t we just release a load of content? Profit-hungry edtech providers and the consultants hoovering up fees in the current maelstrom of cost-cutting won\u2019t want the question to die. The answer ultimately lies in cultivating in students a tolerance for ambiguity \u2013 the ambiguity of social space, the ambiguity of exactly what a lecturer (or text) meant, and the ambiguity of what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d argument or essay. At risk of romanticising the experience of in-person teaching and learning, it offers at its best a kind of collective holding environment in which it is OK to be uncertain or ignorant about things, safe in the knowledge that this uncertainty and ignorance will gradually recede. A teaching space contains all sorts of relationships, both tacit and formal, that ensure learning is never a simple transaction or transmission of information. In such communities, not everything is divided into \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d answers. For a period of time, Covid inserted a digital interface into billions of social relations, turning educational exchange into a type of game, in which there are \u201cmoves\u201d, \u201cscores\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d, but no productive ambiguity. This was a disaster for the young people who became trapped in bedrooms, with their education reduced to mechanical inputs and outputs. The struggle to reverse this continues. Devi Sridhar Chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author of How Not to Die (Too Soon) I recently had to teach master\u2019s students about the pandemic and could feel my heart rate quicken at the prospect. \u201cCollective amnesia\u201d is the best way to describe how the world has since decided to approach Covid. We\u2019d rather forget the initial fears about the disease, the trauma of hearing the daily death toll, the rainbow signs in windows and the lockdowns. If you survived, it\u2019s easy to look back and think it wasn\u2019t that bad. Those who died aren\u2019t around to contribute their views, although their loved ones have made powerful interventions. A colleague who lost his 34-year-old son in 2021 reminded me that these voices aren\u2019t heard enough. More than 230,000 people in the UK have lost their lives to the disease. This is how I narrate what occurred during the pandemic. In 2020, governments that had a consistent message and coherent plan \u2013 such as Sweden and South Korea \u2013 used public health measures such as mass testing, masks and awareness campaigns, and didn\u2019t have to resort to severe interventions, or even lockdowns. In the summer of 2020, trial data indicated we would soon have vaccines. At this point, every country should have been trying to buy time before the vaccines could be rolled out, using tests to identify cases and stop chains of infection. Doing this without causing significant disruption to education, society and the economy was a huge challenge. Some countries and regions managed to strike the right balance. Others did not. Once vaccines arrived in December 2020, the objective shifted. Instead of just containing the spread of Covid-19, health authorities began trying to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. Countries that pivoted quickly to this strategy, such as New Zealand and South Korea, managed to avoid major loss of life. Those that continued trying to contain the virus without promoting vaccines across their populations, such as China and Hong Kong, suffered a delayed wave of Covid cases and a high death toll. As a public health expert, a lingering question I now ask myself is whether something like this could happen again, within our lifetimes. Avian flu is spreading across the US and infecting birds and cows. Meanwhile, an unidentified illness found in bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already killed more than 50 people. Both of these examples show that outbreaks are inevitable and unpredictable. It would be over simplistic to claim that, as a society, we overreacted to Covid. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can prevent a similar pandemic from occurring again. Avian flu is currently one of the most concerning diseases. If it begins to spread among humans, and carries a high fatality rate, governments won\u2019t need to ask people to stay home. Those people will look around at their loved ones, hear what\u2019s happening to families and in hospitals, and make decisions about their safety for themselves. That\u2019s why collective amnesia is the wrong response to Covid. No matter how much we might wish to forget it ever happened, we should now be focusing on building resilience for the next pandemic, and investing in science, particularly vaccine programmes. That would be a far better way to honour the legacy of those who died from this disease. Rachel Shabi Author of Not the Enemy \u2013 Israel\u2019s Jews from Arab Lands and Off-White: The Truth About Antisemitism The stats alone show us the significance of Covid mutual aid groups. By April 2020, a month after Britain\u2019s first national lockdown was announced, a network of about 4,000 mutual aid groups was up and running. One survey in May that year reported that 10 million people in the UK were involved in some form of volunteering in response to the pandemic. Analysis of the impact of these groups has appraised them as having been essential in keeping society\u2019s most vulnerable afloat during the Covid crisis. Mutual aid plugged a giant hole left by a seemingly indifferent and incompetent government, whether by providing food deliveries, prescription-runs and dog-walks, or casting a mental safety net to the lonely and isolated, with regular check-ins across a (socially distanced) doorstep. Mutual aid, a term coined by the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, is a hyperlocal system of support premised on the slogan \u201csolidarity not charity\u201d. It is about horizontal, two-way support: the idea that we all gain from helping each other because humans are wired to collaborate and connect; to participate and to share. It is fundamentally a political idea, even if not always articulated that way by those involved. When I interviewed mutual aiders across the country, volunteers often described it as providing meaning and purpose in a way that regular paid work did not. While these groups were at their peak, there was talk of society being rebuilt from the bottom up, the process itself creating a new collective push for a different kind of party politics. It didn\u2019t really turn out that way, even though mutual aid itself did not go away when the worst of the pandemic died down. A report in 2022 suggested that four in 10 of the mutual aid groups set up during the pandemic were still going, with many focused on helping communities cope with the cost of living crisis. Today, we still see versions of mutual aid everywhere, from disaster-relief groups dealing with the fires that raged across Los Angeles, to the networks providing food, medical relief and safe zones in response the humanitarian catastrophe of Sudan\u2019s war. It springs up whenever a crisis meets an inadequate state response. In other words, mutual aid still thrives precisely because it is a way for people to connect and do something in response to multiple, spiralling global crises, even as they grow increasingly disengaged from party politics. It is both the failure of and alienation from big \u201cP\u201d politics that drives support for mutual aid, as governments do not meaningfully address the climate emergency or redress terrible social iniquities. It\u2019s hard to see how the dots between community organising and political pressure might connect. But perhaps that is to miss the point of mutual aid. The shift is in the tissue of the relationships forged, the practice of accountability to each other. Amid a global surge in far-right politics premised on competitive individualism, mutual aid builds awareness that societies can instead be founded on collectivism \u2013 and those that do will thrive. Helen McCarthy Historian and author of Double Lives: A History of Working Motherhood Women\u2019s working lives changed after March 2020 in complicated ways. Many found themselves on the frontline of the NHS. In other sectors historically dominated by women, such as retail and hospitality, workers were imperilled by restrictions, and millions were furloughed. Meanwhile, school and nursery closures meant that frazzled mothers now had to juggle Zoom calls with round-the-clock childcare. Five years on, how does the picture look for working women? As a historian, it is hard to resist comparisons with an earlier crisis, the second world war, which mobilised millions of women and helped kickstart the dramatic growth in their employment that swept the second half of the 20th century. Covid hasn\u2019t done anything like that. On the eve of the virus, the female employment rate was high \u2013 72% \u2013 and it has barely changed since. But that headline figure may mask the effects of the pandemic on older women, thousands of whom have moved out of the workforce into early retirement, or are now classed as \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d. This trend has also affected men, but women\u2019s reasons for not being in work are more likely to include caring for family or long-term illness, including long Covid, of which there are more female sufferers than male. These numbers also conceal the pressures experienced by mothers who are barely hanging on to their jobs owing to the lack of affordable childcare. The UK\u2019s problems with childcare did not start in 2020, but the chaos of lockdowns exacerbated staff shortages. Many workers left the sector for more stable and less stressful jobs, and costs have continued to spiral. At the start of the pandemic, there were hopes that the pivot to remote working would help working parents achieve a better balance by cutting out the commute and giving them more control over their time. Before 2020, only one in eight workers reported working from home. That figure has now risen to two in five. Here, there\u2019s an echo of the second world war, when part-time shifts were promoted to sceptical employers as a means of recruiting housewives to munitions factories that desperately needed labour. By the 1980s, about a third of working-age women were employed part-time. Those jobs were typically low-skilled, low-paid and carried fewer rights than full-time jobs. Today\u2019s hybrid workers, by contrast, are more likely to be well-paid professionals. They are also more likely to be men. Initially, there was a sense that fathers would embrace equal, hands-on parenting styles if they spent more time at home. If anything, workplace inequalities have persisted.\u00a0True, some mothers in white-collar occupations have undoubtedly benefited from hybrid working. But much larger numbers of women remain in jobs that are less amenable to home-based work, including\u00a0those in hospitals, care homes and supermarkets. It is cruelly ironic that one of the few positive legacies of the pandemic is mostly unavailable to those whose essential labour got Britain through the crisis. Samira Shackle Journalist and the author of Karachi Vice In July 2023, the US politician Robert Kennedy Jr was filmed saying that \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d and that the US \u201cput hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes\u201d. Now, in February 2025, Kennedy is US health secretary. It is a stark example of a much broader phenomenon: in the five years since the Covid pandemic began, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringes of society to the centres of power. During the pandemic, more people began to doubt authorities, expertise and elites. Populist movements, including some explicitly rooted in conspiracies, already existed before Covid \u2013 but the pandemic significantly broadened their appeal. QAnon began in 2017, as a response to (false) claims that Hillary Clinton was the leader of an elite cabal of paedophiles, but by 2020, its supporters were campaigning against masks and vaccines. This is indicative of the way in which conspiracy movements adapt and cross-pollinate; during the pandemic, we also saw longtime conspiracy grifters such as David Icke and Piers Corbyn taking on Covid as a cause, as that\u2019s where a new audience lay. When I reported on the rise of Covid conspiracies in the miserable locked-down spring of 2021, it struck me that many of the people I spoke to had started with reasonable concerns. They were isolated, angry, and suffering financially and emotionally as a result of lockdowns. They had a sense that something wasn\u2019t right, and the idea that the pandemic was being exaggerated, or was cover for something more sinister, provided an explanation. (As the writer Naomi Klein has said: \u201cConspiracy culture gets the facts wrong, but the feeling is right.\u201d) I spoke to some people over the course of a few months, and as they became more immersed in the online world of conspiracies, their initial views became more extreme \u2013 perhaps a shift from questioning the origins of the pandemic to full-blown vaccine scepticism. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely fallen out with the government, and I will never, ever trust them again,\u201d one woman told me. The pandemic vastly expanded the number of people who feel this way. As a general rule, once someone has engaged fully in one set of conspiracy theories, investing time and energy in them, and probably losing real-world friends in the process, they become more receptive to other conspiracies too. And those who peddle these theories online adapt their views according to what is most popular or expedient. People who came to prominence talking about the pandemic have since moved on to other issues, taking their audience with them. A number of British Telegram groups set up during the pandemic to oppose lockdowns and vaccinations have switched to far-right messaging, for instance. The pandemic and associated lockdowns may have receded from the public imagination, but people who really bought into the conspiracies swirling around it haven\u2019t gone back to thinking how they did before. In an increasingly fragmented media environment, and with conspiracists sitting in positions of huge political power in the US, this is a problem for us all. Rachel Clarke Palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Almost exactly five years ago, Dave Jones, an ICU consultant in Wales, posted a tweet that made NHS colleagues cheer. \u201cThe NHS reminds me of a hippopotamus. It might sometimes appear slow, maybe a bit bloated and somewhat unresponsive. But my god, this last week or so has shown that like a hippo, it can move bloody fast and have some awesome power when it needs to.\u201d He had captured brilliantly the breakneck transformation \u2013 unprecedented in NHS history \u2013 of every inch of the health service to cope with the onslaught of Covid. Hospitals ripped up the rules and demolished conventions to double or treble their ICU capacities. In under a month, 33,000 extra patient beds were created \u2013 the equivalent of building 53 new district general hospitals across the country. Barriers dissolved, silos vanished. Red tape \u2013 this time of the literal kind \u2013 suddenly reconfigured our A&E into \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d zones \u2013 the kind of thing that in the NHS normally takes 26 committees and two years to achieve. Money and bureaucracy, for once, were no object. We all worked together to do what was right. What shocks me today is how little of that mind-blowing dynamism remains.\u00a0Then, staff\u00a0were unleashed to transform our systems to help patients. Now, we\u2019re back in the old quagmire of inertia, bureaucracy and system-says-no because there\u2019s no money to do anything differently. A new government has promised an NHS revolution, but patients are still dying on trolleys in corridors. Social care \u2013 yet again \u2013 isn\u2019t a government priority. Trusts still can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, pay for doctors to fill the rota gaps to keep patients safe at night. Staff struggle against the system to give patients the care they deserve. In particular, it astounds me that five years after an airborne virus wreaked such deadly havoc, NHS England has failed to act on all the lessons learned. This winter, NHS leaders loudly blamed a viral \u201cquad-demic\u201d for the appalling crisis conditions in our hospitals, as though somehow natural forces had tied the government\u2019s hands. Yet three of those four viruses \u2013 influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Covid-19 \u2013 are spread through the air. Why haven\u2019t Hepa filters been installed in all our hospitals and GP surgeries\u00a0when we know they effectively remove the virus particles breathed in by staff and patients?\u00a0Where were the universal mask mandates for staff to help reduce the spread? Why was the default mask for staff the flimsy paper variety, not the significantly more protective FFP2 kind? It is surely the falsest of economies to stick to cheap paper when you know this will lead to higher rates of staff infection, endangering patients and causing staff to be too unwell to work. As the Covid inquiry creaks on, I have been unnerved to find myself agreeing with Dominic Cummings\u2019s testimony. Cummings has excoriated the groupthink, inertia and monolithic assumptions that dominate the actions of government, the civil service and the NHS. He\u2019s right. We often talk about those electrifying months, five years ago, when we were liberated \u2013 and supported \u2013 to make the radical changes our patients needed. If only the same were true now.",

Tricky triangle What is the length of AD, the dashed line? Solution: x = 1 The reason that most people fail to solve this one is because the triangle is degenerate: it is, actually, a line, not a triangle. The horizontal side has length 8. The other two sides add up to 8, so these two sides will lie on top of the horizontal line. People who spot that the triangle is degenerate still get the puzzle wrong, as they immediately assume that the distance between A and D is 0. A moment\u2019s reflection, and you realize it is 1. 2. Rockin\u2019 rectangles It\u2019s easy enough to divide a square into five rectangles. But can you: i) Divide a square into five rectangles such that no two rectangles share an entire side in common \u2013 i.e. the sides of abutting rectangles never start and finish at the same points? (The rectangles do not need to be the same size or shape.) ii) Divide an 11 x 11 square into five rectangles in such a way that the ten side lengths are the whole numbers from 1 to 10? Hint: if you have solved part i) use this arrangement of rectangles. Solution i) You can change the size of the rectangles, and flip the ones around the side to go the other way, but this is the only pattern that works. ii) There are two solutions, both have a kernel of 4x7. You will get there by trial and error, and by observing the constraints. The side length is 11, so there must be four sets of two side lengths that add up to 11. The area is 121, so the sum of the areas of the 5 rectangles adds up to 121. In other words, how can you divvy up the numbers from 1 to 10 into pairs, the sum of whose products is 121?

        "text": "The answers to today\u2019s prime teasers Earlier today I set two puzzles involving prime numbers \u2013 in particular 3, 7 and 11. Primes are on this month\u2019s cultural radar thanks to the Apple TV+ thriller Prime Target, which stars hunk du jour Leo Woodall (above.) Here they are again with solutions. 1. Prime power Without using a calculator, what is the last digit of 3 to the power of a million, i.e 31,000,000? Solution: 1 When you multiply 3 by itself, the final digit of the answer cycles through the digits 3, 9, 7 and 1. Since a million is divisible by four, the final digit of 3 to the million is 1. 2. The 7-Eleven A shopper walks into a convenience store and buys four items. The cashier says the total is \u00a37.11. \u2018How funny,\u2019 says the shopper. \u2018That\u2019s the name of the shop.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s also funny is that I multiplied the prices of the four items together,\u2019 says the cashier. \u2018Aren\u2019t you supposed to add the items together?\u2019 replies the shopper. \u2018You can do if you like \u2013 the total is exactly the same.\u2019 What are the prices of the items? Solution \u00a33.16, \u00a31.25, \u00a31.20 and \u00a31.50 Let the prices be a, b, c and d. Then we know [1] a + b + c + d = 7.11 [2] a x b x c x d = abcd = 7.11 We can assume that the prices in the shop are in pounds and pence, so lets multiply each of them by 100 to get rid of the decimal point. [3] 100a + 100b + 100c + 100d = 711 [4] 100a x 100b x 100c x 100d = 100,000,000abcd = 711,000,000 To keep things neat, let A = 100a, B = 100b, etc, so we can rephrase the above. [3] A + B + C + D = 711 [4] ABCD = 711,000,000 We need to solve these two equations, and we do this by first finding the prime factors of 711 million. (In the post where I set the puzzle I explained that all numbers can be broken down into their constituent prime numbers.) The prime factorisation of 711 million is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 79. ( I said you were allowed to use this site to find prime factors) Now we work out which of these prime factors make up A, B, C and D. You do this through trial and error, which can be time consuming so at noon I gave the hint that \u00a33.16 was a solution. This corresponds to 316 (since we multiplied the prices by 100). The prime factors of 316 are 79 x 2 x 2. So lets say A = 79 x 2 x 2. The hint also said that the other three prices divide by 5p. Thus we know that 5 is a factor of B, C and D. We also know from [3] that B + C + D = 395. By playing around with the prime numbers in our factorisation, we get B = 5 x 5 x 5 = 125, C = 5 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 120, and D = 5 x 5 x 3 x 2 = 150. Thus the prices are \u00a31.25, \u00a31.20 and \u00a31.50. Check them if you dont believe me! They add up and multiply to \u00a37.11. What\u2019s great about this puzzle not so much the solving of it, but the fact that it is amusing to find such an arithmetical gem in a global brand. I hope you enjoyed the puzzles, I\u2019ll be back in two weeks. Thanks to Steve Thompson who suggested the first puzzle, and to the PR team at Apple TV+.

The cashier says the total is \u00a37.11. \u2018How funny,\u2019 says the shopper. \u2018That\u2019s the name of the shop.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s also funny is that I multiplied the prices of the four items together,\u2019 says the cashier. \u2018Aren\u2019t you supposed to add the items together?\u2019 replies the shopper. \u2018You can do if you like \u2013 the total is exactly the same.\u2019 What are the prices of the items? I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. (And I\u2019ll add some hints at noon.) Hint: one of the prices is \u00a33.16 and the others are divisible by 5p. UPDATE: Read the solutions here. Thompson had the idea for Prime Target two and a half decades ago when he was head of maths at a grammar school in Kingston-upon-Thames. The science writer Simon Singh presented a talk in his school in which he explained how prime numbers are used in cryptography to make the internet secure. Prime numbers are considered the building blocks of maths because every whole number can be expressed as the product of a unique combination of primes. For example, 100 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5. Or 102 = 2 x 3 x 17. But prime numbers occur in a way that looks random \u2013 and this lack of a pattern can be harnessed to keep data secret. If a pattern is found in the primes, however, these secrets will no longer be secure. The idea captured Thompson\u2019s imagination: \u201cHere was a quest to find a number pattern that had been going on for thousands of years, and yet here we were in the 21st century, basing all of computer security on the fact that no pattern existed. It made me realise \u2013 if someone were finally to discover a pattern, then our whole digital world would be at risk.\u201d Shortly after Singh\u2019s visit, Thompson quit his job to try his hand writing plays. He then become a celebrated screenwriter, with TV credits including Sherlock and Dr Who. But he never forgot about his prime number idea, and it became Prime Target, which was released on Apple TV+ to positive reviews last month. Thompson\u2019s contribution above is his favourite puzzle, which features 3, a prime number. You can\u2019t use a calculator for the first puzzle, but you can for the second one. You will need to find the prime divisors of a large number, for which you are allowed to use this site here. NO SPOILERS. Please discuss your favourite primes. I\u2019ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.",

        "text": "Complete your personal information for a more tailored experience Home Don't miss out Subscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industry By Isabella Cueto Feb. 28, 2025 Chronic Disease Reporter Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted a document Friday proposing to strip public participation from much of the business his department conducts. The move comes during a time of major upheaval across federal health agencies, and as the public waits to see how Kennedy will enact his pledge of \u201cradical transparency\u201d at the department. The statement, placed in the Federal Register, said HHS would rescind its longtime practice of giving members of the public a chance to comment on the agency\u2019s plans.\u00a0It is set to be formally published in the register on Monday, March 3. advertisement \u201cThis is a direct attack on the idea that HHS \u2014 a gigantic agency \u2014 should have to tell the public everything that it\u2019s doing,\u201d said Alex Howard, an open government advocate and former director of the Digital Democracy Project at Demand Progress Educational Fund. Normally, before issuing a new rule or regulation, the public is given an opportunity to submit written comments in support or in opposition to government proposals. This has been the case for years under the Administrative Procedure Act. However, Kennedy and HHS are arguing they don\u2019t need to seek public input when the agency is making decisions about \u201cagency management or personnel,\u201d or related to public property, loans and grants, benefits, or contracts. HHS can also choose to cut out public participation when it deems the process \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,\u201d per the law. advertisement The move is \u201chugely concerning and will almost certainly be challenged,\u201d said a former high-level HHS official in the Biden-Harris administration. \u201cThis includes grants, loans, and benefits, which is a large portion of what HHS does.\u201d HHS did not immediately respond to STAT\u2019s request for comment. Since 1971, HHS has chosen to involve the public in its rulemaking about the listed issues, and to err on the side of sharing more publicly \u2014 to forego the process \u201csparingly.\u201d This decision, referred to as the Richardson Waiver, has made it so anyone could read through notices in the Federal Register of what HHS planned to do, and offer feedback. HHS says it is rescinding the little-known waiver because the public participation process imposes too many responsibilities on the department, \u201cbeyond the maximum\u201d requirements of the law. Those obligations \u201care contrary to the efficient operation of the department, and impede the department\u2019s flexibility to adapt quickly to legal and policy mandates,\u201d Kennedy wrote in the document. Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science at University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, said the justification Kennedy provides for his decision is \u201cinaccurate\u201d because agencies have always been allowed to go above and beyond the Administrative Procedure Act. \u201cThis is really troublesome in that it represents a backsliding on good government practices and it doesn\u2019t really provide any justification for that backsliding,\u201d he said. If the policy is implemented, it would mean HHS \u201ccan simply announce changes,\u201d Coglianese said.\u00a0It was not immediately clear what all would be covered under the proposed change, or why Kennedy is moving to rescind the waiver now. \u201cWhat does a public benefit, exactly, entail?\u201d said Jeffrey Davis, a director at McDermott+ and a former HHS adviser who worked with senior officials on Medicare budget and policy. \u201cThe terms are pretty broad.\u201d The decision stands in contrast to Kennedy\u2019s repeated promises to make HHS an agency whose processes and data are so accessible that public records requests would not even be necessary. advertisement \u201cWe\u2019re going to work together to launch a new era of radical transparency,\u201d Kennedy said on Feb. 19. \u201cOnly through radical transparency can we provide Americans with genuine informed consent, which is the bedrock and the foundation stone of democracy. Transparency allows diverse parties to establish common ground of mutually trusted information.\u201d In the 1980s, HHS attempted to overturn the same rule in order to skip public participation on decisions related to loans, grants, benefits and contracts. It faced intense backlash, according to a write-up at the time by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. Dozens of members of Congress wrote a resolution asking the health secretary to withdraw his proposal. Around that same period, officials were considering changes to public benefit programs, including to Medicare. HHS attorneys eventually walked back their proposal. From a legal standpoint, HHS can decide to do less public engagement than it had done in previous decades under the APA, Coglianese said. And there is still room for individual agencies to engage the public more deeply, but it would be on a case-by-case basis instead of across the board. \u201cIt will, if nothing else, give the appearance that the department wants to undertake some changes that would be politically unpopular and might think that it would have a greater chance of making those decisions without a lot of public controversy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s often foolhardy to short-circuit public engagement. It\u2019s not even good regulatory practice, quite frankly.\u201d While the waiver change may not immediately end up in court, RFK Jr.\u2019s decision could face pushback from Congress or from the public. HHS makes decisions that affect millions of Americans\u2019 lives, so involving the public is essential, said Doug Linkhart, president of the non-partisan National Civic League. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit at a desk in Washington and imagine what works best for people across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, it makes the policies better and probably speeds things up by avoiding problems down the road, like lawsuits.\u201d advertisement Sarah Owermohle and Lizzy Lawrence contributed reporting.

I will see you in the brackets. advertisement When measles struck New York in 2018 and 2019, federal health officials uniformly preached the power of immunizations. President Trump, himself, implored people to get the shot. But several years later, public messaging has dramatically changed, writes STAT\u2019s Andrew Joseph. At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, a reporter asked Trump about the rapidly growing outbreak centered in Texas \u2014 over 124 confirmed cases, including the country\u2019s first measles death in a decade in an unvaccinated child. Trump passed the question to his health secretary, and longtime vaccine critic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who downplayed the outbreak and misstated the death toll. The lack of messaging from the executive branch is an early sign that Trump\u2019s embrace of prominent anti-vaccine critics like RFK Jr. could usher in a period of greater skepticism of basic public health tenets. \u201cWhat I\u2019m struck by is the near total silence from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in communicating about this outbreak, talking about the importance of vaccination, providing its own perspective and voice on the outbreak,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, an expert on vaccine policy at the Yale School of Public Health. advertisement Late Thursday, the CDC quietly released a statement about the outbreak, burying it on its website instead of sending an email to reporters. While it emphasized that \u201cvaccination remains the best defense against measles infection,\u201d the statement lacked the full-throated defense of vaccines present in prior administrations. Read more from Drew\u2019s excellent story. Some rare good news from the Department of Stuff We Wish We Had More Time To Write About. There were three vaccines-related studies in this week\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, published Thursday by the CDC. Two were vaccine effectiveness studies that estimate the differences in outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. \u2014 Helen Branswell The National Institutes of Health usually welcomes around 1,200 students onto its campuses each summer, but this year will be an exception. In an internal email obtained by STAT, the agency announced that it is cancelling its Summer Internship Program, also known as SIP, even though some students had already been accepted. The program has for years given students interested in research careers hands-on experience and career counseling, including interns from groups underrepresented in science. The agency did not provide an explanation for the move, but it comes at a time when NIH has also stopped recruiting postdoctoral researchers; Ph.D. students; and postbacs, who are recent college graduates. \u201cThis was a challenging decision, and I know some of you will disagree with us; however, we are following the path we feel is best for the students and this institution,\u201d wrote Sharon Milgram, director of the agency\u2019s Office of Intramural Training and Education. \u2014 Jonathan Wosen Everyone\u2019s down to support a colleague in crisis, but nobody wants to dish on their own mental health troubles at work, according to a new poll from the National Association of Mental Illness and Ipsos. People want mental health support in the workplace, but nearly half of the 2,376 adults surveyed worry that their careers would suffer or that they would be judged if they talked with their colleagues about their mental health. The stakes remain high, even if the stigma tamps down conversation surrounding mental illness: a similar poll in 2024 found high rates of burnout among women, young workers and mid-level employees.

Sivasailam and his colleagues tested Grok and other LLMs by showing them 10 X-ray images of fractures. The technologies struggled to identify breaks or only partially identified others. For these technologies to improve, they need to boost their high-resolution image processing and more training on large datasets of medical images, curated by radiologists.

        "text": "Complete your personal information for a more tailored experience Home Don't miss out Subscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industry By John F. Crowley Feb. 28, 2025 Crowley is the president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO). With the right policies, advanced science, and strong leadership in government agencies, President Donald Trump has the power to save more American lives from rare diseases than any president in history. That might be a bold statement, but it is based on my prior conversations with him as well as his public statements and actions in his first term. And such leadership and change cannot come soon enough for so many in need. Eight years ago this week, my family and I met with the president just before his first address to a joint session of Congress \u2014 on World Rare Disease Day. In that Oval Office meeting, we discussed how reforming, modernizing, and streamlining the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u00a0approval process for rare disease therapies could create a wave of new cures and therapies for the millions who suffer \u2014 most of them children. And we discussed the need for strong and bold leadership at the FDA. advertisement That evening in Congress, as we were guests in the presidential box in the gallery, the president recounted the story of our daughter Megan, then a sophomore at Notre Dame, who was born with a rare, often fatal genetic disorder known as Pompe disease. Thanks to a lifesaving therapy pioneered by my own biotech start-up, Megan was by our side during that speech. She remains healthy and vibrant despite the physical disabilities caused by her disease. She is now a social worker with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \u201cIf we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government,\u201d the president said that night, \u201cthen we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.\u201d Now that he is in the White House again and sprinting forward, the president has a renewed chance to put this vision into action. He has the power to advance the ecosystem in this \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of innovation that will lead to more cures not only in the rare genetic diseases, but in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, autoimmune disease, and many other maladies. advertisement Simply slashing personnel at federal health agencies, however, does not equate to removing outdated restraints and modernizing an important regulatory body. Some of the administration\u2019s recent efforts to reform the federal government through aggressive and often indiscriminate personnel cuts have lacked the strategic insights necessary to modernize and reform our nation\u2019s health care agencies, especially the FDA. Instead, the administration should build on what works at agencies like the FDA while fixing what is broken \u2014 trimming redundancies, upending bureaucracies, enhancing a patient-focused culture, and utilizing state-of-the-art regulatory science to accelerate cures. And we need regulators at the FDA who have a mindset that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d and that our nation\u2019s biotech companies are partners in this shared vision for newer and better medicines in the rare genetic diseases, and beyond. This approach would create a regulatory environment that spurs breakthrough treatments at an unprecedented pace and ensures that lifesaving medicines reach all patients as quickly as possible. The president demonstrated his ability to accelerate lifesaving medical innovation during his first term. Operation Warp Speed delivered the first Covid-19 vaccines in record time, helping to end the pandemic faster than many expected and literally saving countless lives. If the FDA and other agencies lose their most knowledgeable employees, though, they will struggle to evaluate and approve new medicines quickly \u2014 or even at all. Patients in need will suffer. It will curtail biotech innovation and needlessly cede our biotech dominance to China. In my years as a biotech entrepreneur, I struggled mightily at times with an FDA that, in rare diseases, was often failing Americans. Delay and denial frequently equaled prolonged suffering, and sometimes death. As the president correctly observed in that 2017 speech to Congress, \u201cOur slow and burdensome process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.\u201d advertisement A properly staffed, experienced, expert, and strongly led FDA is essential to advancing our most promising new therapies in development to reach those in need. As the Trump administration has already acknowledged, bold procedural changes that greatly speed and transform the agency\u2019s regulatory review process \u2014 such as modernizing the clinical trial framework to better reflect medicines\u2019 development in the 21st century \u2014 are also critical. So is the use of all available tools, like biomarkers, to predict clinical benefit and accelerate approvals. In just the past year, we have finally turned the corner on accelerating rare disease medicines at the FDA. We cannot lose that momentum. Last year, Peter Marks at the FDA led the creation of the first ever Rare Disease Innovation Hub. It allowed multiple programs in the rare diseases that were stuck at the FDA for many years to finally move forward. Marks has said, \u201cWe would rather approve a product based on a review of preclinical and clinical data than leave patients without options.\u201d Marks\u2019 leadership and vision, particularly in the cell and gene therapy space for rare and other diseases, is vitally important to this continued momentum. His leadership will also be critical to the success of the president\u2019s highly qualified choice to be the new FDA commissioner, Johns Hopkins\u2019 Marty Makary. Thankfully, these reforms all align with the Trump administration\u2019s larger agenda to Make America Healthy Again. The president has proven his commitment to speeding medical innovation as well as eliminating bureaucratic inefficiencies and bolstering the most dynamic parts of our economy. And he has proven his commitment to helping those living with rare diseases. Indeed, the mark of a great society is how it cares for the weakest and most vulnerable among us. Few are collectively more vulnerable than those living with rare diseases, especially our children \u2014 including those with pediatric cancers, which by definition are all rare diseases. advertisement But none of these aims can be achieved through indiscriminate cuts to federal health regulators. What\u2019s needed is a more precise approach to streamline and modernize agencies like the FDA so that they work both better and faster for all those in need. That\u2019s what it will take to unlock the full potential of America\u2019s life sciences sector and to build the nation of miracles that our children need \u2014 and deserve. John F.

        "title": "STAT Health Tech: Google's new FDA clearance, Teladoc earnings",
        "text": "Complete your personal information for a more tailored experience Home Don't miss out Subscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industry By Mario Aguilar Feb. 27, 2025 Health Tech Correspondent You\u2019re reading the web edition of STAT\u2019s Health Tech newsletter, our guide to how technology is transforming the life sciences.\u00a0Sign up to get it\u00a0delivered in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. With Google\u2019s annual health-focused PR event coming up in March, the company this week announced a flurry of updates. advertisement First, Google announced that the Food and Drug Administration cleared a loss of pulse detection feature for its Pixel 3 smartwatch. It\u2019s a 510(k) clearance, and as of writing, it\u2019s not posted to the FDA\u2019s website. The feature uses the wearable\u2019s sensors to detect that your heart has stopped beating \u2014 Google cites cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, and overdose or poisoning as reasons why this might happen. After a brief check-in period, the smartwatch sounds an alarm and starts a countdown. If there\u2019s still no response, the watch uses uses built-in cellular or a connected smartphone to contact emergency services with context and location. Google plans an education campaign with emergency services groups so they know what exactly to make of these new calls. The feature is not meant for people with preexisting heart conditions or who need cardiac monitoring. Google this week also published a Nature paper describing the development of the loss of pulse feature. Since it\u2019s not feasible to hand out wearables and sit around waiting for hearts to stop, the company used simulated events to train its model, including planned testing of implanted defibrillators by electrophysiologists and using a tourniquet to cut off circulation to an arm. There was concern that false positives would put undue strain on emergency services, so Google opted for absolutely certainty of crisis in its design. The feature has sensitivity of 67.23% and a specificity of 99.987%. In other words, roughly 67 out of 100 loss-of-pulse events will be detected, but the product will only improperly flag an event .013% of the time. The company claims there was only one errant emergency call in its prospective testing. My big question when this feature was announced last fall was how big a difference it could make. As the Nature paper notes, unwitnessed cardiac arrest is \u201cnearly unsurvivable.\u201d CPR needs to be started almost instantly or brain damage and death quickly follow. I imagined collapsing alone in my home while making my mid-morning toast. Even if the feature detected I was in trouble, by the time emergency services arrived and got in, I myself would be toast. But Jake Sunshine, a research scientist at Google, pointed out to me that many times, loss of pulse happens unbeknownst to people around who can help \u2014 maybe your spouse in the next room or sleeping in bed next to you. If they hear an alarm, your chances might greatly improve. Given the feature was designed with a low false positive rate, I admit, I find myself thinking \u2014 why not? advertisement Also this week, Google released a report about the company\u2019s \u201cimpact on health,\u201d which provides a nice survey of the company\u2019s disclosed work. On Wednesday, Teladoc Health reported that its 2024 revenue dropped 1% to $2.57 billion. The company projected a revenue range between $2.47 billion and $2.58 billion for 2025, meaning Teladoc expects a sliver of\u00a0growth at best, and another yearly decline at the lower end of the projection. Teladoc\u2019s virtual mental health company BetterHelp continues to be a drag on overall financial performance, recording an 8% drop in revenue compared to last year. Looking ahead, Teladoc expects another yearly revenue decline of between 3.75% and 9.75%. BetterHelp\u2019s direct-to-consumer model is dependent on pricy advertising to draw in new users who can be cost sensitive and quick to churn out. On the company\u2019s earnings call, CEO Chuck Divita cited product improvements to keep users engaged, international expansion, and a new weekly pricing model as initiatives that could lead to stability and growth. BetterHelp\u2019s struggles overshadow Teladoc\u2019s modicum of success with the integrated care services it sells to health plans and employers, which grew 4% in 2024. The company said it could grow between o% and 3% in 2025. Teladoc experienced huge growth during the pandemic but has since struggled to turn its tremendous user base into a profitable business. Since taking over last year, Divita has been making changes he claims will right the ship. \u201cI am confident that the actions we\u2019re taking this year will provide a strong foundation for us to deliver improved performance over the longer-term,\u201d he told investors. Analysts, writing after the earnings call, speculated that things could start looking up in 2026. Smart ring maker Oura announced a number of\u00a0 new women\u2019s health-focused initiatives. First, a study with Scripps Research Digital Trials Center to investigate physiological changes during pregnancy and complications in hopes of identifying possible warnings signs. The study hopes to enroll 10,000 participants. (The research reminds me of the BUMP study that I wrote about a few years ago, which used, among other sensors, an Oura ring.) advertisement The company is also working with researchers at Stanford on a Study on Typically Ignored Groups of Menstruating Adults, which will aim to recruit people typically not represented in women\u2019s health research. Finally, the company announced that the readiness score that it shows users \u201cnow takes into account the biometric changes that occur throughout the menstrual cycle.\u201d The change will prevent naturally occurring fluctuations in physiology from registering as signs of strain. Hyfe, which develops cough-detection technology, this week announced a new deal with Japanese pharma company Kyorin to develop a digital therapeutic to address chronic cough for the Japanese market. The treatment will deliver Behavioral Cough Suppression Therapy, which includes education and suppression strategies. Hyfe\u2019s cough-detection technology, which can be embedded in smartphones and other devices with microphones, will be used to track cough counts, frequency, and bouts, which the company hopes will increase efficacy by promoting, \u201cengagement, motivation, and adherence.\u201d Kyorin distributes Merck\u2019s drug for chronic cough, gefapixant, in Japan and for right now, the company plans to market the new digital treatment independently of the drug. The FDA rejected gefapixant in the United States, and Hyfe sees an untapped opportunity here. The company eventually hopes to bring its digital treatment through the FDA and is open to partnerships to bring it to the U.S. market.

Can you believe the temperature in Boston hit the 50s yesterday? It\u2019s the first false start to spring, and I\u2019m sure that there are more cold days ahead of us. But still, it was so, so sweet. advertisement A \u201cschool-aged child\u201d in Texas has died from measles, officials announced yesterday. It\u2019s the first death from the disease in the U.S. since 2015. We know that the child wasn\u2019t vaccinated, but other details like their gender, exact age, and previous health status have not been disclosed. So far, 18 people have been hospitalized in this outbreak of what STAT\u2019s Helen Branswell writes is one of the most infectious diseases known to humankind. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared to try to downplay the news in a press conference yesterday, noting that \u201cwe have measles outbreaks every year.\u201d Read more from Helen on the case. And in other infectious disease news: The USDA announced yesterday an additional $1 billion to help the country\u2019s poultry industry fight the accelerating outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that has devastated farmers and driven the price of eggs to record highs. advertisement STAT readers already know that bird flu has been a problem in the country\u2019s dairy cows for close to a year, since the first outbreak was confirmed in Texas last March. But the USDA plan does not include any additional efforts to curb the spread among cattle, signaling that the Trump administration is approaching the disease as primarily an issue of economic concern, STAT\u2019s Megan Molteni and Helen Branswell\u00a0write. But it\u2019s more than economics: The ongoing spread among cows has raised fears that bird flu could become an endemic pathogen in a species that has considerable contact with people \u2014 which then would increase the odds that it could evolve in ways that make it easier to spread among people. Read more from Megan and Helen. Between 2017 and 2021, female physicians died by suicide at more than 1.5 times the rate of females in the general public, according to a study published yesterday in JAMA Psychiatry. The rates were significantly higher before the Covid-19 pandemic began, but comparable after, the study authors write. In the same time period, male doctors died by suicide at lower rates than men in the general public. Out of everyone in the study who died by suicide, physicians were more likely to have experienced depressed moods, mental health issues, and legal problems than non-physicians. It\u2019s a commonly-cited statistic that doctors die by suicide at twice the rate of the general population. And while there\u2019s persistent evidence that medical professionals, especially doctors, suffer poor mental health broadly at higher rates than the public, the evidence on suicide rates specifically has varied. Many studies use older data, and there\u2019s a powerful stigma around mental illness in medicine, making suicides particularly difficult to track. (This study used data from the National Violent Death Reporting System to analyze the deaths.) The Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, passed by Congress in 2022 in honor of a physician who died by suicide, aimed to support health care workers\u2019 mental health needs. It expired last year, and Congress has yet to reauthorize it. advertisement Two weeks ago, the NIH released a bombshell proposal to cap what it pays research grant recipients for overhead costs (indirect costs) at 15% of the grant amount. While that\u2019s a fraction of what most universities receive from the federal government, it\u2019s close to what private foundations pay for indirect costs \u2014 part of the justification put forth by the NIH in making the change. But several scientific funding experts told STAT\u2019s Anil Oza that the comparison isn\u2019t a fair one. Part of it is historical precedent, as universities have come to rely on federal funding \u2014 and accept less than is needed from private sources because of that. On top of that, sometimes a private foundation will allow researchers to label certain costs as \u201cdirect\u201d that the government would deem \u201cindirect.\u201d Read more from Anil on the distinctions between private and public funding for academic research. In December 2020, at the end of President Trump\u2019s first term, Congress allocated $1.15 billion to the NIH for research on the lasting health consequences of Covid-19. Now, a little more than four years later, Trump has disbanded the HHS secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Long COVID. In a new First Opinion essay, physician Steven Phillips argues that the decision could signal the end of meaningful federal involvement in fighting the disease for millions of long Covid sufferers. But it\u2019s not only a Trump thing, Phillips says. The demise of the committee \u201cencapsulates the strikingly unproductive federal government long Covid track record of the past four years,\u201d he writes. Read more on what Phillips sees as the admittedly bleak outlook for the long Covid ecosystem in today\u2019s political environment. Following complaints from constituents, a New York congressman is launching an examination of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s management of large physician groups in the state\u2019s Hudson Valley region. The inquiry seeks to gather information from community members about the quality and accessibility of health care services since UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum subsidiary purchased two local medical groups in 2022 and 2023. advertisement The statement announcing the examination cites STAT\u2019s yearlong investigation, titled Health Care\u2019s Colossus, that found UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance arm pays Optum\u2019s medical groups higher rates than competing practices for common services, raising costs for consumers and undermining competition.

The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a\u00a04-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).

        "text": "A five-day mass polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip concluded on Wednesday, reaching nearly 603 000 children under 10 years of age with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) following comprehensive, simultaneous access to all five governorates during the ongoing ceasefire. The campaign was conducted as part of emergency efforts to end an ongoing poliovirus outbreak and prevent further spread in the Gaza Strip. During this round, an additional 40 000 children were vaccinated as compared to the previous two rounds conducted in September and October 2024, after poliovirus was detected in the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire enabled health workers to reach more children who had missed vaccinations due to displacement during the phased approach, living in areas that previously required special coordination for access, or being unreachable during the October 2024 round due to insecurity in North Gaza, including Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun. Strong community engagement and awareness of vaccination benefits had maintained high immunization rates in the Gaza Strip, where 89% of children received the third dose of oral polio vaccine in 2023, before the conflict.\u00a0 This round drew upon 1660 vaccination teams, 1242 of which were mobile, and deployed 1242 social mobilizers. Despite bad weather conditions, families welcomed the initiative and brought their children to points where they could receive the polio vaccine. The campaign was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners. As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative\u2019s commitment to mount a robust poliovirus outbreak response, surveillance for disease in children and for virus circulation in the environment has also been intensified since July 2024. It was this timely surveillance that detected ongoing environmental circulation of the virus, and the need to conduct additional vaccination to protect children. As the ceasefire provides an opportunity to resume critical public health functions, working to recover Gaza\u2019s previously strong disease surveillance and routine immunization are the best ways to protect children from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Ending polio hinges on fully vaccinating every last child with polio vaccines.\u00a0 Ensuring uninterrupted access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and proper nutrition will protect children from many diseases including polio. WHO, UNICEF and partners continue to call for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term health and peace. Media Contacts WHO Media Team World Health Organization UNICEF Media  Related News",

Previously, no safe listening guidelines or standards existed for video gameplay devices or software. \u201cEveryone can take steps today to ensure good hearing health throughout their life,\u201d said Dr J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases. \u201cThe WHO/ITU safe listening standard supports governments, manufacturers, civil society, and other stakeholders to foster safe listening environments, so that\u202fpeople of all ages can protect their ears and hearing, and even\u202fwhen playing video games, do not risk hearing loss.\u201d Video gameplay and esports are rapidly becoming one of the largest entertainment industries worldwide. About 3 billion people play video games on devices such as personal computers, video game consoles, and mobile phones, yet most devices and games lack safe listening features to protect users from harmful noise. However, gamers risk permanent hearing loss from prolonged exposure to loud sounds while gaming or listening to music. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their lower sound tolerance and growing interest in gaming. Through the provision of information, warnings and safe listening features, the new standard aims to inform video game players of the risk to hearing loss from loud video gameplay activities and raise awareness about how they can practice safe listening. \u201cAs video gaming and esports continue to grow and gamers use a wider array of devices to access their content, safe listening standards are vital to help protect the hearing of users, especially children, from sounds which could damage their hearing,\u201d said Seizo Onoe, Director, Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, International Telecommunication Union. \u201cCreating effective technical standards requires\u202fcollaboration which leverages each other's strengths. We are grateful to our partners at WHO for their insight and experience advancing safe listening, and are pleased to launch this update on World Hearing Day.\u201d The WHO-ITU Global standard on safe listening for video gameplay and esports is designed to protect hearing for all types of video game players, across a wide range of gameplay scenarios and equipment. The standard provides separate guidelines for video gameplay devices (video game consoles, handheld or mobile devices and personal computers, headphones and headsets), and video game software. For video gameplay devices, the standard recommends: For video gameplay software titles, the standard recommends: The new standard was developed under WHO\u2019s\u202fMake Listening Safe\u202finitiative which seeks to improve listening practices especially among young people, drawing on the latest evidence and consultations with a range of stakeholders including experts from WHO, government, industry, consumers, and civil society. In addition to the new global standard released today, two other standards for safe listening were launched in 2019 and 2022, including the H.870 WHO-ITU Global standard for safe listening personal audio devices and systems and the WHO Global standard for safe listening in venues and events (also adopted by ITU in 2024).

With this initiative, WHO is embracing a new approach by leveraging crowdfunding to support its mission. For the first time, WHO is activating its existing infrastructure \u2013 spanning 150 country offices \u2013 alongside the WHO Foundation\u2019s reach, to amplify this grassroots movement. This strategic shift not only strengthens community engagement but also aligns with WHO\u2019s broader strategy to diversify funding sources and support its ongoing Investment Round. Since its launch in early 2025, almost 5000 people from over 140 countries have contributed to the campaign through the WHO Foundation, created to bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of WHO. The high level of success and engagement demonstrates that there is a broad sense of solidarity and shared commitment to global health. This campaign is not just about crowdfunding \u2013 it\u2019s about people standing together to remind us that health is a right, not a privilege. \u201cThe power of the 1 Dollar, 1 World movement comes from the people. In particular, I would like to thank my colleague Tania Cernuschi for her inspiration to launch this initiative,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIt shows that in times of crisis, people everywhere can unite and commit to protecting and promoting the health of others. WHO is proud to stand behind this initiative, which embodies the values of solidarity, action, innovation and hope.\u201d The challenges global health has faced in recent years \u2013 from pandemics to humanitarian crises \u2013 make it clearer than ever that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement is a chance for people everywhere to turn concern into action and show that solidarity, just like health, knows no borders. \u201cThis campaign started with one person, but it belongs to all of us,\u201d said Tania Cernuschi, the WHO staff member who launched the original initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s proof that individuals can make a difference, and that together, we are stronger.\u201d Media and the public are invited to support and share this movement. Every action \u2013 whether a donation, a post, or a conversation \u2013 helps spread the message that health should be for all, not just for some. Every stakeholder \u2013 whether a person, an organization, a community or a government \u2013 has a role in building efficient and effective collaboration for health. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement invites everyone to take action for global health in three simple ways: All donations, collected by the WHO Foundation, support lifesaving efforts around the world, with a strong focus on country-level initiatives. These resources are essential in driving impactful implementation where it matters most based on the decisions of WHO\u2019s 194 Member States. Together, we can drive real change.

        "title": "\r\n\tMass polio vaccination campaign to continue in the Gaza Strip\r\n",
        "text": "The emergency polio outbreak response in the Gaza Strip is continuing, with a mass vaccination campaign scheduled from 22 to 26 February 2025. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk. Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection. Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region. In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now. No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024. The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April. The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners. Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak. WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital have commenced distribution of critically-needed childhood cancer medicines in 2 of 6 pilot countries, through the Global Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines. Currently, these medicines are being delivered to Mongolia and Uzbekistan, with next shipments planned for Ecuador, Jordan, Nepal and Zambia. The treatments are expected to reach approximately 5000 children with cancer across at least 30 hospitals in these countries within this year. The Global Platform is a first initiative of its kind. Countries in the pilot phase will receive an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines at no cost. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), childhood cancer survival rates are often below 30%, significantly lower than those in high-income countries. Six additional countries have been formally invited to join the platform. The initiative is poised to become the largest, with the goal of reaching 50 nations in the next 5 to 7 years. It aims to eventually provide medicines for the treatment of approximately 120 000 children with cancer in LMICs, significantly reducing mortality rates. \u201cFor too long, children with cancer have lacked access to life-saving medicines,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cThis unique partnership between WHO and St. Jude is working to provide quality-assured cancer medicines to paediatric hospitals in low-and middle-income countries. WHO is proud to be part of this joint initiative with St. Jude, bringing health and hope to children around the world.\u201d Every year, an estimated 400 000 children worldwide develop cancer. The majority of these children, living in resource-limited settings, are unable to consistently obtain or afford cancer medicines. It is estimated that 70% of the children from these settings die from cancer due to factors such as lack of appropriate treatment, treatment disruptions or low-quality medicines. \u201cA child\u2019s chances of surviving cancer are largely determined by where they are born, making this one of the starkest disparities in global healthcare,\u201d said James R. Downing, MD, president and CEO of St. Jude. \u201cSt. Jude was founded on Danny Thomas\u2019 dream that no child should die in the dawn of life. By developing this platform, we believe this dream can someday be achieved for children stricken by cancer, irrespective of where they live.\u201d St. Jude and WHO announced the platform in 2021 to ensure children around the world have access to lifesaving treatments. The platform brings together governments, the pharmaceutical industry and non-governmental organizations in a unique collaborative model focused on creating solutions for children with cancer. The co-design approach addresses the broader needs of national stakeholders, with a focus on capacity building and long-term sustainability. The platform provides comprehensive end-to-end support, from consolidating global demand to shaping the market, assisting countries with medicine selection and developing treatment standards. It represents a transformative model for the broader global health community working together to tackle health challenges, in particular for children and noncommunicable diseases. To accomplish this, St. Jude and WHO partner with UNICEF Supply Division, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Strategic Fund. World Health Organization Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. WHO is the UN agency for health that connects nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations \u2013 leading the world\u2019s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. WHO\u2019s mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. On childhood cancer, WHO works with over 100 global partners through the\u00a0Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, to support governments in developing high-quality cancer centres and regional satellites that ensure early, accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for children with cancer. WHO also develops standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for diagnosis, treatment and palliative and survivorship care. Progress on childhood cancer, as well as on other noncommunicable diseases, are part of the agenda for the UN General Assembly Fourth\u00a0High-Level Meeting of the on noncommunicable diseases to take place in September 2025. St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and other life-threatening disorders. It is a non-profit organization based in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, and the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at\u202fSt. Jude\u202fhave helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to 80% since the hospital opened more than 60 years ago.\u202fSt. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes\u202fto help doctors and researchers at local hospitals and cancer centers around the world improve the quality of treatment and care for even more children.\u202fTo learn more, visit stjude.org,\u202fread Progress: A Digital Magazine and follow St. Jude on social media at\u202f@stjuderesearch.

        "title": "\r\n\tDire health and humanitarian crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo prompts escalation of efforts by WHO, partners\r\n",
        "text": "The recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to significant loss of life, trauma, displacement, and the destruction of critical health infrastructure, exacerbating an already dire situation for millions of people. The situation remains tense and volatile, and the health needs are immense. WHO remains on the ground, and has continued to respond to the health needs by providing lifesaving medical supplies, supporting health workers, and coordinating the emergency response. Hospitals and morgues are overwhelmed. Since 26\u00a0January, 3082 injured and 843 dead have been reported from 31 health facilities in and around Goma, North Kivu. With the alarming expansion of violence further south, 65 injuries were reported from 3 hospitals in South Kivu. These numbers are expected to rise further as more injured people are able to reach health facilities and more dead bodies are gathered off the streets. Wound infections are a risk for those who have not been able to reach health care facilities quickly, and as health facilities are running out of supplies they need to clean and disinfect. The sight of bodies lying uncared for is distressing. Though the bodies of people who have died from injury do not generally carry or spread disease, it is the right of the dead to be identified and receive proper burial, and important for the living to know their loved ones have received this care. Over 70 (or 6%) of the health facilities in North Kivu have been affected, with some completely destroyed and others struggling to restart operations. Some ambulances have also been damaged. A WHO-supported health clinic in North Kivu was temporarily occupied by armed groups. Health workers have had to flee in places, while in others, they have been working round the clock for days, with limited resources and overwhelming demand, and sometimes at risk to their own lives. Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and other routine services are also affected as medicines have run out and health workers are either absent or overburdened. The risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth has increased from already high levels. Given the insecurity, pregnant women cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Experience with conflict in the region has shown the drastic effect it has, with the rate of births attended to by skilled health workers dropping to near zero during periods of intense violence. The threat of infectious diseases has multiplied. Cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox and tuberculosis are among the infectious threats in the area. The water supply in Goma was disrupted and has only partially resumed, leading people to use water from the lake, and heightening the risk of cholera spread. Close to 600 suspected cases of cholera and 14 deaths were reported from North Kivu between 1 and 27 January. Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially South Kivu province, is the epicentre of the mpox outbreak that prompted the WHO Director-General to declare a public health emergency of international concern last August. The mpox response is heavily impacted. Ninety percent of the mpox patients (128 of 143) in isolation units in Goma had fled for safety, making it nearly impossible to provide them with care, and increasing the risk of spread. One in four people in the region was already facing emergency levels of hunger, with the recent violence expected to worsen the situation. Malnutrition and disease go hand-in-hand: malnourished people are less able to fight disease, while disease leads to further malnutrition. This vicious circle is especially concerning when it comes to children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Goma was home to over 2 million people, including 700\u00a0000 people displaced by this crisis. These people have had to flee yet again, in search of safety. They are in temporary settlements, with their health and safety at risk. A rapid assessment of 10 healthcare facilities in and around Goma showed a concerning rise in rape and other gender-based violence: there were 45 cases reported among the displaced, and 21 survivors of gang-rape admitted to two hospitals. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. These patients require medical care, psychological support, and support with maintaining their livelihood, especially when they are the sole providers for their families. WHO has deployed emergency medical supplies, hygiene and water treatment supplies, and tents to increase hospital capacity by 1000 beds. Supplies are being depleted rapidly, and more resources are urgently needed. WHO is preparing further deliveries as part a European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)-led effort to fly in critical supplies. For this, the Goma airport, a critical lifeline, must be urgently reopened. WHO is also exploring options to deliver critical supplies through other routes. WHO and partners were able to resume mpox vaccination in Goma on Wednesday, 5\u00a0February after a 10 day pause. The United States\u2019 recent decision to freeze foreign aid is significantly impacting relief efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year, the US contributed to as much as 70% of the country\u2019s humanitarian response. Additionally, the US is a major funder of the mpox response, and has pledged a million vaccine doses of its own stock to global efforts. While WHO\u2019s humanitarian response in the region relies on funding from other donors\u2014including the European Union, United Kingdom and the WHO\u2019s Contingency Fund for Emergencies\u2014reductions in overall aid will have repercussions on people\u2019s health. To meet immediate health needs in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, including for safe and dignified burials, WHO has spent US$\u00a0600\u00a0000. The overall response requires US$ 50 million. WHO calls for humanitarian access, the protection of health workers and facilities, and an end to attacks on health care. Health facilities, supplies, workers and patients should be protected. Ultimately, we call for peace, and an end to the unimaginable and long suffering of the people in this region.

        "text": "Female genital mutilation is a violation of human rights that inflicts deep and lifelong physical, emotional and psychological scars on girls and women. This harmful practice affects more than 230\u00a0million girls and women today. An estimated 27\u00a0million more girls could endure this violation of their rights and dignity by 2030 if we do not take action now. Today, on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, and in response to the theme \"Stepping up the pace: Strengthening alliances and building movements to end female genital mutilation\", UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO reaffirm our commitment to work together with countries and communities to end this harmful practice \u2013 once and for all. There is hope. Many countries have seen a decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation. We are witnessing progress in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where collaborative action and community-led initiatives are proving that by strengthening alliances and building movements, we can accelerate change. Since the launch of the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation in 2008, and in collaboration with WHO, close to 7\u00a0million girls and women access prevention and protection services. Additionally, 48\u00a0million people have made public declarations to abandon the practice, and 220\u00a0million individuals were reached by mass media messaging on the issue. In the last two years, close to 12\u00a0000 grassroots organizations and 112\u00a0000 community and frontline workers galvanized to effect change at this critical juncture. Yet the fragility of progress made has also become starkly evident. In the Gambia, for example, attempts to repeal the ban on female genital mutilation persist, even after an initial proposal to do so was rejected by its parliament last year. Such efforts could gravely undermine the rights, health and dignity of future generations of girls and women, jeopardizing the tireless work over decades to change attitudes and mobilize communities. Of the 31 countries in which data on prevalence are collected nationally, only seven countries are on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of ending female genital mutilation by or before 2030. The current rate of progress must accelerate urgently to meet this target. This requires strengthened alliances among leaders, grassroots organizations and across sectors spanning health, education and social protection \u2013 as well as sustained advocacy and expanded social movements with girls and survivors at the centre. It demands greater accountability at all levels to ensure commitments to human rights are upheld and policies and strategies are implemented to protect girls at risk and provide care, including justice, for survivors. It also requires increased investment in scaling up proven interventions. We are indebted to generous donors and partners who are supporting this life-changing work and call on others to join them. We all have a role to play to ensure that every girl is protected and can live free from harm. Let\u2019s step up the pace and act with urgency. The time to end female genital mutilation is now.  Notes to Editors About the UNFPA\u2013UNICEF Joint ProgrammeThe UNFPA\u2013UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation: Delivering the Global Promise works to eliminate female genital mutilation through interventions in 17 countries where the practice is prevalent.

        "text": "In a global first, Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners today launched a first-ever clinical efficacy trial for a vaccine from Ebola from the Sudan species of the virus, and at an unprecedented speed for a randomized vaccine trial, in an emergency. This is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola Sudan virus disease. IAVI, the provider of the vaccine, conducted trials for safety and immunogenicity. It is also the first clinical trial of the vaccine during an outbreak. The principal investigators\u00a0from Makerere University and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), with support from WHO and other partners, have worked tirelessly to get the trial ready in 4 days since the outbreak was confirmed on 30 January. It is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola disease due to Sudan virus. The speed was achieved through advanced research preparedness, while ensuring full compliance with national and international regulatory and ethical requirements. The candidate vaccine was donated by IAVI, with financial support from WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and support from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). \u201cThis is a critical achievement towards better pandemic preparedness, and saving lives when outbreaks occur,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\u2019s Director-General.\u00a0 \u201cThis is possible because of the dedication of Uganda\u2019s health workers, the involvement of communities, the Ministry of Health of Uganda, Makerere University and UVRI, and research efforts led by WHO involving hundreds of scientists through our research and development Filoviruses network. We thank our partners for their dedication and cooperation, from IAVI for donating the vaccine, to CEPI, EU HERA and Canada\u2019s IDRC for funding, and Africa CDC for further support. This massive achievement would simply not be possible without them.\u201d In 2022, during the previous outbreak of Ebola disease (also from the Sudan species of the virus) in Uganda, a randomized protocol for candidate vaccines was developed. Principal investigators were designated under the leadership of the Minister of Health, and teams were trained to allow such a trial to take place during an active outbreak. The randomized vaccine trial to assess the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) candidate vaccine was launched\u00a0at a ceremony in Kampala today by the Minister of Health of Uganda. WHO is co-sponsoring the trial. WHO was represented by Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme and Deputy Director-General, and the WHO representative to Uganda Dr Kasonde Mwinga, along with other colleagues. Three vaccination rings were defined today. The first ring involves about 40 contacts and contacts of contacts of the first reported and confirmed case, a health worker who has died. Although several promising candidate medical countermeasures are progressing through clinical development, as of now, there is no licensed vaccine available to effectively combat a potential future outbreak of Ebola disease from the Sudan species of the virus. Licensed vaccines exist only for the disease caused by Ebola virus, formerly known as Za\u00efre ebolavirus. Likewise for treatments, approved treatments are only available for Ebola virus. The vaccine for the trial was recommended by the independent WHO candidate vaccine prioritization working group. If the candidate vaccine is effective, it can contribute to controlling this outbreak and generate data for vaccine licensure. In 2022, the research teams were trained in good clinical practice (GCP) and standard operating procedures for such trials. They completed refresher training in recent days. WHO colleagues experienced in trials and in ring vaccination arrived in Uganda over the weekend to support the trial implementation and GCP compliance. The vaccine doses were pre-positioned in the country. WHO worked with the principal investigators and national authorities and the vaccine developer to review cold chain documentation and ensure the doses were stored correctly over the previous years. As part of the signed agreement with the Ministry of Health, WHO has a signed agreement with IAVI for additional doses of the candidate vaccine to be made available shortly. Notes to editors The trial is a ring vaccination cluster randomized trial designed to assess the effect of one single, promptly given, dose of the candidate vaccine whose safety and immunogenicity have already been demonstrated in Phase 1, in protecting recent contacts and contacts of contacts of a newly confirmed case of Sudan virus disease (SVD). Ring vaccination consists of the targeted vaccination of the recent contacts of an index case.\u00a0It might protect the individual vaccinated or help create a small buffer zone of immunized\u00a0people that could limit propagation of the infection. The ring vaccination trial involves a population at increased risk of infection as they have recently been in contact with a case of SVD, so it may well provide useful information about the protection of such case-contacts quickly, within just a few months. The same study design was used in the Ebola \u00e7a suffit trial in Guinea in 2015 by WHO and the Ministry of Health of Guinea to evaluate a now-licensed vaccine against a different species of ebolavirus. On 4 February 2025, a correction was made to the opening sentence of this news release as noted below. The sentence in the original news release read: In a global first, Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners today launched a first ever vaccine trial for Ebola from the Sudan species of the virus, and at an unprecedented speed for a randomized vaccine trial in an emergency.

        "text": "WHO and partners have immediately boosted their support to the Ugandan government\u2019s response to an outbreak of Sudan virus disease outbreak (SVD, part of the Ebola family), including by facilitating access to a candidate vaccine and candidate treatments. The first 2160 doses of the vaccine candidate and the treatments are already in Kampala, Uganda, as they were prepositioned as part of outbreak preparedness. The vaccine trial processes underway include orientation of the research teams on the trial procedures, and logistics arrangements. Research teams have been deployed to the field to work along with the surveillance teams as approvals are awaited. The candidate vaccine and the candidate treatments (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) are being made available through clinical trial protocols, which will make it possible to further document their efficacy and safety. As of 30 January, there was one confirmed case and 45 contacts who are being followed up. Uganda has experienced five previous SVD outbreaks. The last one was declared in September 2022 and ended in January 2023, with 164 cases and 77 deaths. During that outbreak, a WHO committee of external experts evaluated candidate vaccines and provided recommendations on their suitability for evaluation in Uganda, as part of a clinical trial against the SVD virus. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health of Uganda and its designated Ugandan Principal Investigators and their teams from Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, as well as worldwide filovirus and trial experts and regulators, to initiate the trials. The trials were designed via a global collaborative effort coordinated by WHO, that included developers, academic institutions, regulatory authorities, other experts and researchers from Uganda and other countries at risk of filoviruses outbreaks. The aim of the vaccine trial is to evaluate a potentially efficacious candidate vaccine, and if efficacious, to possibly contribute to ending the ongoing outbreak and protect populations at risk in the future. Those eligible to join the trial are those at highest risk of SVD, i.e. close contacts of a person who has been confirmed to have had SVD or who has died from the disease. The study sites will therefore be the locations where contacts of the case or cases reside. Study teams will be mobile and able to rapidly move to these areas to do their work using the ring vaccination approach. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and with Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, who will lead the trials\u2019 implementation. The development of the protocols and research priorities has been done via the MARVAC Consortium and the Collaborative Open Research Consortium (CORC) for the Filoviridae Family, and numerous developers facilitated the availability of the candidate vaccine and treatments: IAVI provided their candidate Sudan vaccine, Gilead provided remdesivir, an antiviral. Among those supporting the trials\u2019 implementation are the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre, the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and WHO. This rapid action is the result of tireless efforts to build international cooperation on research, innovation and evaluation and deployment of countermeasures in the face of dangerous pathogens. While outbreaks of SVD are controllable without vaccines, control can be achieved more quickly using safe and effective vaccines. In the meantime, a comprehensive outbreak response is underway in Uganda to rapidly halt transmission, identify contacts and carry out epidemiological investigations, while enhancing community awareness. WHO has allocated US$ 1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to help accelerate outbreak control efforts. Sudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates that is due to Orthoebolavirus sudanense (Sudan virus), a viral species belonging to the same genus of the virus causing Ebola virus disease.\u00a0 Case fatality rates of Sudan virus disease have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks. There are no approved treatments or vaccines for Sudan virus, but early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Sudan virus disease.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates Niger for having met the criteria for onchocerciasis elimination, making it the fifth country globally and the first country in Africa to be acknowledged by WHO for interrupting transmission of the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. Eliminating a disease is a significant achievement that requires tireless dedication,\u201d stated Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cI congratulate Niger for its commitment to liberating its population from this blinding, stigmatizing illness that causes so much human suffering among the poorest. This success is yet another testament to the remarkable strides we have made against neglected tropical diseases and offers hope to other nations still battling onchocerciasis, demonstrating that elimination is possible.\u201d Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease and is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, after trachoma. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infective black flies, primarily found in riverine areas. The disease primarily affects rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen, with smaller endemic areas found in parts of Latin America. Between 1976 and 1989, under the umbrella of the WHO Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP), Niger undertook vector control measures by spraying insecticides that significantly decreased levels of onchocerciasis transmission. Following the donation of ivermectin by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme (MSD), areas still affected by lymphatic filariasis (LF) underwent mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole from 2008 to 2019, followed by surveillance. Since ivermectin is effective against both diseases, and areas targeted for LF MDA were also endemic for onchocerciasis, this intervention also contributed to interrupting the transmission of the Onchocerca volvulus parasite. Niger started preliminary assessments on interruption of onchocerciasis transmission in 2014 after stopping LF MDA in most areas. This was followed by entomological and epidemiological surveys which revealed that the combination of medicine and vector control had successfully eliminated transmission of onchocerciasis, as evidenced by the reduction in prevalence from approximately 60% to 0.02%. In addition to the vector control interventions and the medicines donated by MSD, a key factor contributing to Niger\u2019s success is the partnership between the Nigerien government, WHO and nongovernmental organizations, which has helped mobilize resources and technical support. Continuous monitoring of the disease\u2019s prevalence and its impact has enabled timely adjustments in strategies and ensured the effectiveness of interventions. \u201cOnchocerciasis has long caused immense human suffering. It has also impeded the economic development of affected communities, driving people away from rivers, which are often lifelines for livelihoods,\u201d says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \u201cNiger\u2019s success ends this burden for its people. It also positions Niger as a model for the elimination of neglected tropical diseases in Africa. The country previously demonstrated its leadership in public health, by eliminating Guinea-worm disease in 2013. Today, it takes another historic step forward.\u201d Globally, 54 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Niger joins four other countries that have been verified by WHO for eliminating onchocerciasis, all in the Region of the Americas: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Guatemala (2016) and Mexico (2015). In the WHO African Region, 21 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Onchocerciasis is the second neglected tropical disease eliminated in Niger: the country was certified free of dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease) transmission in 2013.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates Guinea for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem. This form of human African trypanosomiasis, the only type transmitted in Guinea, is the first neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in the country. The news marks an important achievement in this public health field on the eve of the world Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, marked on 30 January. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is both a testament to the global progress against neglected tropical diseases and a beacon of hope for nations still battling human African trypanosomiasis,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by infected tsetse flies. Symptoms include fever, headaches, joint pain and, in advanced stages, neurological symptoms like confusion, disrupted sleep patterns and behavioural changes. In the 1990s, HAT resurged along Guinea\u2019s coast due to increased human activity in mangroves, driven by Conakry\u2019s economic and population growth. In response to the critical threat posed by HAT, Guinea\u2019s Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene established the National Programme for the Control of HAT in 2002, with support from WHO and the Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), and later from partners such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and the Institut Pasteur de Guin\u00e9e. The programme began with mass medical screenings to diagnose and treat cases effectively, marking a crucial step in controlling the disease. The programme introduced vector control interventions in 2012 aiming to interrupt contact between people and tsetse flies. Initially implemented in the Boffa-East area, this strategy expanded nationwide by 2016, with nearly 15\u00a0000 impregnated mini-screens (with insecticides to attract and kill the tsetse flies) deployed annually. However, Guinea faced significant challenges in its HAT elimination efforts during the Ebola outbreak and COVID-19. From 2013 to 2015, the Ebola epidemic caused a suspension of medical activities, leading to a resurgence in HAT cases. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic posed further disruptions, but the programme adapted by implementing door-to-door HAT screening to maintain control efforts. Collaboration with local communities played a critical role throughout these years, ensuring that interventions were culturally acceptable and widely supported. Advances in diagnostic techniques, treatment delivery, and consistent financial and technical backing from WHO and other partners bolstered the programme\u2019s impact. As a result, Guinea successfully reduced the number of HAT cases to below the WHO threshold of 1 case per 10\u00a0000 inhabitants in all endemic areas, achieving a major milestone in its fight against this neglected tropical disease. \u201cThe elimination of sleeping sickness is the result of many years of effort by the Guinean government, its partners and communities in the overall context of the national policy to combat all neglected tropical diseases,\u201d said Dr Oumar Diouh\u00e9 BAH, Guinea's Minister of Health and Public Hygiene. \u201cThe elimination of human African trypanosomiasis by Guinea is a significant public health achievement. Vulnerable families and communities can now live free of the threat posed by this potentially fatal disease,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \u201cI congratulate the government, health workers, partners and communities for this crucial milestone. \u201cWHO remains committed to supporting countries to eliminate human African trypanosomiasis and other neglected tropical diseases in Africa.\u201d With Guinea, seven other countries have been validated by WHO for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis: Togo (2020), Benin (2021), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (2021), Uganda (2022), Equatorial Guinea (2022), Ghana (2023) and Chad (2024). The rhodesiense form of the disease has been eliminated as a public health problem in one country, Rwanda, as validated by WHO in 2022. Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. These parasites are passed to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies, which acquire the infection from humans or animals carrying the pathogenic parasites. There are two forms of the disease: one caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, found in 24 countries in West and Central Africa and which accounts for more than 92% of cases; and another caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, found in 13 countries in East and Southern Africa accounting for the remaining cases. The main approaches to controlling sleeping sickness include reducing the reservoirs of infection and reducing the presence of the tsetse fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients earlier in the disease development. If diagnosis is made early, it is possible to avoid complicated and risky treatment procedures during the advanced stage, and to improve the cure prognosis.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) expresses deep concern about the implications of the immediate funding pause for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries. These programmes provide access to life-saving HIV therapy to more than 30\u00a0million people worldwide. Globally, 39.9\u00a0million people were living with HIV at the end of 2023. A funding halt for HIV programmes can put people living with HIV at immediate increased risk of illness and death and undermine efforts to prevent transmission in communities and countries. Such measures, if prolonged, could lead to rises in new infections and deaths, reversing decades of progress and potentially taking the world back to the 1980s and 1990s when millions died of HIV every year globally, including many in the United States of America. For the global community, this could result in significant setbacks to progress in partnerships and investments in scientific advances that have been the cornerstone of good public health programming, including innovative diagnostics, affordable medicines, and community delivery models of HIV care. We call on the United States Government to enable additional exemptions to ensure the delivery of lifesaving HIV treatment and care. The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\u00a0(PEPFAR) has been a flagship initiative of the global HIV response since its establishment over 20 years ago. The current funding pause for PEPFAR will have a direct impact on millions of lives that depend on the predictable supply of safe and effective antiretroviral treatment. PEPFAR works in over 50 countries around the world. Over the past two decades, PEPFAR funding has saved more than 26\u00a0million lives. Currently, PEPFAR is providing HIV treatment for more than 20\u00a0million people living with HIV globally, including 566\u00a0000 children under 15 years of age. Over the past year, PEPFAR and partners, including WHO, have been working on sustainability plans with countries for greater country ownership and reduced donor support up to and beyond 2030. A sudden and prolonged stop to programmes does not allow for a managed transition and puts the lives of millions at risk. WHO is committed to support PEPFAR and other partners, as well as national governments, in managing change processes effectively to minimize the impact on people living with HIV.

        "text": "Following a nearly century-long effort, Georgia has been certified malaria-free by the World Health Organization (WHO). With today\u2019s announcement, Georgia joins the ranks of 45 countries and 1 territory that have achieved this milestone. \u201cToday we congratulate the people of Georgia for their decades of targeted and sustained actions to eliminate malaria, one of the world\u2019s leading killers,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s commitment and success gives us hope that a malaria-free world is possible.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge milestone worth marking; with Georgia\u2019s achievement, the WHO European Region is another step closer to initiate certification as the first malaria-free region in the world,\u201d said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, this was made possible thanks to sustained investment, dedication of the health workforce and targeted efforts in prevention, early detection and effective treatment of all malaria cases.\u201d Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years. The Minister of Health, Mikheil Sarjveladze, noted that certifying Georgia as malaria-free is a recognition of the sustainability of its healthcare system, \u201cthis success means that Georgia can address important health challenges.\" Malaria has plagued Georgia since ancient times. Before the introduction of systematic control efforts in the early 1900s, at least 3 malaria parasite species\u2014P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. vivax\u2014were endemic in the country. In the 1920s, an estimated 30% of the population suffered from malaria caused by the P. vivax malaria species. By 1940, large-scale mosquito control programmes had helped reduce malaria cases significantly through improved access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. A few years later, however, World War II caused a surge again due to population movement and the strain on health facilities. In the post-war period, Georgia launched an intensive programme aimed at eliminating malaria, using newer medicines, insecticide spraying and robust entomological surveillance. The campaign successfully interrupted the transmission of P. falciparum by 1953, P. malariae by 1960 and P. vivax by 1970. Georgia remained malaria-free for 25 years, but by 2002, malaria had reemerged in the country with 474 cases reported. In 2005, together with 9 other countries in the WHO European Region, Georgia signed the Tashkent Declaration, reaffirming its pledge to eliminate malaria. The intensified interventions that followed significantly reduced malaria incidence in Georgia, with the last indigenous case recorded in 2009. By 2015, all 53 countries of the WHO European Region, including Georgia, reported zero indigenous cases of malaria. To prevent further re-establishment of malaria transmission in the region, the original signatories of the Tashkent Declaration issued the Ashgabat Statement in 2017 committing to take all efforts to remain malaria-free. T\u00fcrkiye is the only country in the WHO European Region remaining to be certified. In 2024, during the Georgia\u2019s malaria-free certification process, members of the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification, an independent WHO advisory body, noted that Georgia has a well-functioning and adequately resourced health system, strong public-private cooperation, and political commitment to maintaining a malaria-free status. WHO malaria-free certification The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification is made by the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification and validation from the Malaria Policy Advisory Group.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the Gaza ceasefire, hostage and prisoner release deal, which brings hope for millions of people whose lives have been ravaged by the conflict. The health challenges ahead are immense. The entire population of Gaza has faced multiple displacements. More than 46 600 people have been killed and over 110 000 have been injured. The real figures are likely much higher. Only half of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals remain partially operational, nearly all hospitals are damaged or partly destroyed, and just 38% of primary health care centres are functional. An estimated 25% of those injured \u2013 around 30 000 people \u2013 face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation. Specialized health care is largely unavailable, medical evacuations abroad are extremely slow. Transmission of infectious diseases has massively increased, malnutrition is rising, and the risk of famine persists. The breakdown of public order, exacerbated by armed gangs, raises further concerns. Addressing the massive needs and restoring the health system will be an extremely complex and challenging task, given the scale of destruction, operational complexity and constraints involved. Billions in investment are needed to support recovery of the health system, which will require the unwavering commitment of donors and the international community. WHO is ready to scale up the response together with UN health partners including UNFPA, UNICEF, UNRWA and 67 Health Cluster partners. However, it is critical that the security obstacles hindering operations are removed. WHO will need conditions on the ground that allow systematic access to the population across Gaza, enabling the influx of aid via all possible borders and routes, and lifting restrictions on the entry of essential items. Also essential are active protection of civilians and health-care workers, expediting medical evacuations through all possible routes for over 12 000 patients (and their companions) who urgently require specialized care, strengthening and speeding up the referral system to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and addressing road repairs, rubble removal, and the remediation of unexploded ordnances. WHO and partners will need a massive scale-up of funding to meet immediate health needs, and to begin to restore the heath system, including the workforce, supply chain and infrastructure. WHO and partners will implement a 60-day plan to support the urgent restoration and expansion of the health system. Focus will be on key priority response areas, including trauma and emergency care, comprehensive primary health care, child health, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). Given the immense needs, WHO is scaling up operations and mobilizing critical supplies and resources for delivery into Gaza. A priority will be the assessment and rehabilitation of partially damaged health facilities in high-need areas. Work is ongoing to urgently increase bed capacity across selected hospitals in northern and southern Gaza, together with the expansion of operational capacities, supporting the hiring and redistribution of national health workers, and increasing deployment of international health workers to fill gaps. Plans are underway to integrate prefabricated clinics and hospitals with existing health facilities to enhance service delivery in underserved and newly accessible areas. Efforts also are underway to strengthen referral processes for critical care within Gaza and facilitate cross-border medical evacuations. Given the high level of malnutrition and disease outbreaks, WHO is working with partners to expand infant and young child feeding programmes, enhance immunization efforts and reinforce disease surveillance systems for timely prevention, reporting, and outbreak management. WHO calls on all parties to uphold their commitment to fully implement the ceasefire agreement and to continue working towards a political solution to address the protracted crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory, which is essential for lasting peace.

        "text": "On 18 December 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified the first diagnostic test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency which can help to safely deliver WHO-recommended treatments to prevent relapse of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) infection. The prequalification of this G6PD diagnostic test marks a significant milestone in facilitating safe and effective P. vivax malaria treatment, reaffirming WHO\u2019s dedication to ensuring equitable access to life-saving health solutions globally. Some 500 000 people die each year from malaria, most of them children. The prequalification of this test immediately followed the prequalification, in early December, of two new tafenoquine products for anti-relapse treatment of P. vivax malaria, and these therapeutics were recommended in updated  WHO malaria guidelines released a few days earlier, in late November. This package of actions by WHO reflects the organization\u2019s recent adoption of synchronized and parallel processes for two key functions: developing recommendations for essential health products and overseeing their prequalification. While these processes remain entirely independent, their alignment aims to significantly reduce the time required to bring vital health products to low- and lower-middle-income countries. This streamlined approach underscores WHO\u2019s commitment to improving global health equity by expediting access to life-saving products. P. vivax malaria is endemic in all WHO Regions except the European Region, with an estimated 9.2 million clinical cases occurring in 2023. P. vivax\u00a0is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. G6PD deficiency, a genetic condition, affects more than 500 million people. While most people are unaware of their G6PD deficiency and go through life without suffering ill effects, certain drugs administered to prevent malaria relapse caused by P. vivax can result in acute haemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Without accessible and reliable G6PD testing, it has been challenging to safely provide anti-relapse treatments, limiting the widespread use of this effective therapy. \u201cThe prequalification of this G6PD enzyme test for patients with P. vivax malaria can help countries in enhancing access to much-needed quality-assured tests, enabling safe and effective treatment and prevention of this type of relapsing malaria,\u201d said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. \u201cCurrently, no other prequalification applications are received for this type of tests. We encourage the submission of additional products to expand the range of effective diagnostic tools available to countries in need.\u201d \u201cWider availability of the test can help strengthen the global malaria response by reducing the number of P. vivax infections due to relapse and in turn reduce onward transmission,\u201d said Dr Daniel Ngamije Madandi, Director of WHO\u2019s Global Malaria Programme. Testing devices that can accurately distinguish patients with G6PD activity levels above and below the normal levels provide critical information to clinicians to decide which of P. vivax anti-relapse treatment regimens is most appropriate, including low- and high-dose primaquine and single-dose tafenoquine.

In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, COVID-19 came to shape our lives and our world. At WHO, we went to work immediately as the new year dawned. WHO employees activated emergency systems\u00a0on 1 January 2020, and informed the world\u00a0on 4 January. By\u00a09-12 January, WHO had published its first set of comprehensive guidance for countries, and\u00a0on 13 January, we brought together partners to publish the blueprint of the first SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test. All along, we convened experts and ministries of health from around the world, gathered and analysed data, and shared what was reported, what we learned and what it meant for people. Read about WHO\u2019s actions in this  interactive timeline. As we mark this milestone, let\u2019s take a moment to honour the lives changed and lost, recognize those who are suffering from COVID-19 and long COVID, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from COVID-19 to build a healthier tomorrow. We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative. Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.

        "text": "The WHO  Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to \u00a0closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. In April 2024, the TAG-CO-VAC    recommended the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccine antigen as one approach to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its descendent lineages.\u00a0 Several manufacturers (using mRNA and recombinant protein-based vaccine platforms) have updated COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition to monovalent JN.1 lineage formulations (JN.1 or KP.2) and some of these have been approved for use by regulatory authorities. Previous statements from the TAG-CO-VAC can be found on the\u00a0 WHO website. The TAG-CO-VAC reconvened on 10-12 December 2024 to review the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2; immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination; the performance of currently approved vaccines against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; and the implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The published and unpublished evidence reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC included: (1) SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution with additional support from the WHO\u00a0 Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution\u00a0(TAG-VE); (2) Antigenic characterization of previous and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants using virus neutralization tests with animal antisera and further analysis of antigenic relationships using antigenic cartography; (3) Immunogenicity data on the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by currently approved vaccine antigens against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants using animal and human sera; (4) Preliminary immunogenicity data on immune responses following infection with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; (5) Available vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved vaccines during periods of circulation of XBB.1 and JN.1 lineages; and (6) Preliminary preclinical and clinical immunogenicity data on the performance of candidate vaccines with updated antigens shared confidentially by vaccine manufacturers with TAG-CO-VAC. Further details on the publicly available data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC can be found in the accompanying data annex. Unpublished and/or confidential data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC are not shown. Summary of available evidence The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of the available data: Given the breadth in immune responses demonstrated by monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccines against circulating variants, the TAG-CO-VAC advises retaining the current COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition, i.e. a monovalent JN.1 lineage variant (NextStrain: 24A, GenBank: PP298019, GISAID: EPI_ISL_18872762) as one approach to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its descendent variants (e.g., KP.3.1.1 and XEC). Other approaches that demonstrate broad and robust neutralizing antibody responses against currently circulating JN.1 descendent lineage variants, such as vaccine antigens derived from more recent variants or alternative formulations, could also be considered. As per the WHO Director General\u2019s\u00a0 standing recommendations for COVID-19, Member States are recommended to continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination based on the recommendations of the\u00a0WHO SAGE. Vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition; vaccination programmes can continue to use any available WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines. Given the limitations of the evidence upon which the recommendations above are derived and the anticipated continued evolution of the virus, the TAG-CO-VAC strongly encourages generation of the following data (in addition to the  types of data outlined in October 2024): As previously stated, the TAG-CO-VAC continues to encourage the further development of vaccines that may improve protection against infection and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The TAG-CO-VAC will continue to\u00a0closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. The TAG-CO-VAC will also continue to reconvene every six months to evaluate the implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. At each meeting, recommendations to either maintain current vaccine composition or to consider updates will be issued.

        "text": "The ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities took effect on 27 November, offering temporary relief for the millions of civilians caught in the conflict in Lebanon. But Lebanon\u2019s suffering did not end amid staggering unmet health needs. Bordering Syria and Israel, Lebanon\u2019s overburdened health system is reeling from the impacts of an economic crisis, political deadlock, refugee crisis and now war. The country is host to 1.5 million Syrian refugees: inevitably, events in Syria impact Lebanon and WHO operations. Syrian nationals are entering Lebanon at the same time as Syrian refugees are returning to Syria from Lebanon. \"An already decimated health system remarkably withstood this latest storm, but it has been further weakened. The challenges are complex and call for specialized, sustained support,\" said WHO Representative to Lebanon Dr Abdinasir Abubakar. The road ahead for Lebanon\u2018s health system is rocky and the future uncertain. Lebanon\u2019s cumulative real GDP has shrunk by 38% since 2019, according to the World Bank, with the war being the latest of many blows. As of today, more than 1 million people displaced by hostilities have returned to southern Lebanon where the physical and health infrastructure is in tatters. Several health facilities remain closed and most hospitals are running below capacity due to financial restraints and shortages of staff, long-standing challenges in Lebanon. More than 530 health workers and patients have been killed or injured in  attacks on health care\u00a0and thousands of health workers have been displaced or have emigrated leaving the hospitals and the health centres grappling to meet the health needs of the populations. In order to keep hospitals running, the need for health workers is dire. Water and sanitation systems have been severely disrupted, compounding the risk of disease outbreaks. With nearly 7% of buildings in ruins in the two southern governorates that were hardest hit, thousands remain on the move and won\u2019t be able to return home anytime soon. Those who have returned face the risks posed by explosive remnants of war, as well as greater overall health risks. Since 8 October 2023, more than 4000 people were killed and 17\u00a0000 injured in Lebanon alone. Since the ceasefire took hold and conflict-impacted areas have become more accessible, the death toll continued climbing as more bodies are found in the  16 000 buildings that have been partially or completely destroyed, leaving an estimated 8 million tonnes of debris. \"The physical destruction is similar to what you see after an earthquake \u2013 and that has resulted in complex injuries, open wounds and fractures. And since the treatment provided during the war was often not optimal, the injured end up needing multiple surgeries to prevent complications and disabilities, \u00a0\" said Dr Ahmad Alchaikh Hassan, WHO Trauma Technical Officer. One in 4 people with life-changing injuries will need long-term rehabilitation and, in some cases, assistive technologies and prosthetics. Specialized support will be required as the technical capacities in Lebanon cannot cope with the increasing numbers of people in need for these services and commodities. \"This need for specialized health care will persist for months and years to come. Lebanon needs reconstructive surgeons to treat the severely injured, eye doctors to treat the thousands of people injured in the pager attack, physiotherapists to start rehabilitating amputees and prosthetists to assist users of assistive devices,\" said WHO Representative Dr Abubakar. Ensuring a sufficient number of trained health workers with expertise in war-related trauma and plastic reconstructive surgery is a priority. Three weeks into an 8-week ceasefire, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health are working on replenishing medical supplies and restoring health services country-wide. \"WHO and national health authorities have carried out several mass casualty management trainings across Lebanon \u2013 resulting in stronger, more life-saving assertive responses. \u00a0Without these timely interventions, the outcomes would be unconscionable,\" said Dr Hassan, WHO's Trauma Technical Officer. The ongoing WHO operations include scaling up trauma care capacity, training surgeons on specialized trauma care in conflict areas, providing mental health trainings to health workers, capacity building for rehabilitation in post-conflict settings, replacing damaged equipment, identifying gaps in health coverage, and preparing for future scenarios and the subsequent health impact. WHO also provided 5000 contingency blood bags and reagents to blood banks and developed awareness material on unexploded ordinances and other health risks for first responders and civilians. WHO and the Ministry of Public Health run strong country-wide surveillance for disease outbreaks which pose a heightened risk in post-conflict settings. \"The road to recovery will be long and windy. Our aim is to assist the health system to bounce back, and be resilient and prepared. We are grateful to our many partners who have supported this response but this is not the end of it. This is the start and the need for technical and financial support has never been greater,\" concluded WHO Representative Dr Abubakar.

        "text": "Why do we laugh when tickled but are unable to tickle ourselves? Neuroscience has the answer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. For many of us, the tickling response is paradoxical \u2014 the playfulness it inspires is typically enjoyable, but the overstimulated nerves and loss of control can feel distressing. Whether you find it enjoyable, uncomfortable or somewhere in between, you can't tickle yourself. But why? The answer has to do with the brain already knowing about and downplaying the expected, predictable sensation of the self-tickle, experts told Live Science. \"It's because the brain is always predicting into the future,\" David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, told Live Science. \"Brains are not just reactive; they are trying to guess ahead at what's going to come next.\" Whenever you perform an action, the primary motor cortex, the part of your brain responsible for initiating the message, sends a copy of the command \u2014 an \"efference copy\" to many areas of your brain to prepare for the sensory information that's about to arrive due to your actions. Perhaps you want to pick up a pencil. Your brain sends a message to your arm and fingers, telling them to grasp the pencil and pick it up. But it doesn't just send the message to the muscles that will generate that movement. It simultaneously sends copies to your somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that processes incoming sensory information, and to your visual cortex, the part responsible for processing vision. Related: Why do people feel like they're being watched, even when no one is there? Konstantina Kilteni, a neuroscientist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, explains that the brain uses the signals it sends to muscles to anticipate how something we initiate will feel before we even experience it. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Kilteni runs the Somatosensation & Gargalesis lab, aptly nicknamed the Touch and Tickle Lab. Using brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and magnetoencephalography, she and her team investigate whether the brain perceives a touch made by oneself differently from a touch produced by something else. Kilteni told Live Science that people consistently perceive the intensity of their own touch as weaker than that of an external touch. It's not just perception; neuroimaging confirms that the brain responds less strongly to self-generated touches. Because these sensations are predictable, the brain tunes them down. Scientifically, we attenuate self-generated sensations. But if those predictions don't match what happens, your brain does notice. David Schneider, an associate professor of neuroscience at New York University who studies acoustic self-awareness, shared an example with Live Science. \"When you shut a car door, you expect to hear a predictable 'thump,'\" he wrote in an email. \"If you instead hear a 'clank,' your brain will instantly recognize that as an error, and you'll turn around and take the seatbelt out of the doorjamb.\" People are alert to external stimuli \u2014 detected by all of the senses \u2014 because noticing them could be crucial to survival. Imagine you are walking. Your footsteps make noises. Hearing your own footsteps is not important, so your brain reduces the noise. But somebody walking behind you could be a threat, so noticing that is important. This phenomenon is not unique to humans. Schneider can't ask the mice he studies if they hear their own footsteps, but he can record the neural activity in the auditory processing area of their brains. When he does, he finds that the neurons hardly react to their own footsteps. \"[I]t's not because the mouse can't hear them or the brain cannot detect them,\" he wrote in an email. \"Because if the mouse is standing still, and those same sounds are presented through a speaker, then those same neurons produce big responses.\" So why can't you tickle yourself? Place one hand in your opposite armpit. Your brain knows where your hand is going before you even move. It simultaneously tells the areas of your brain that will sense the fingers in your armpit that there's nothing important going on here; pay no attention. But if someone else \u2014 an external generator \u2014 comes at that armpit, the sensation is amplified, not attenuated. Your brain is not prepared. The tickle works. Not being able to tickle yourself is simply the consequence of a remarkable adaptation, fine-tuned for survival. \u2014Why is laughter sometimes scary? \u2014What is the Mandela effect? And have you experienced it? \u2014Can you die from laughter? \"For tickling, you require the surprise,\" Eagleman said. \"When someone else comes at you, you don't know precisely what they'll do. But since you predict your own action away, it's just not ticklish.\" There are some exceptions. People with schizophrenia struggle to recognize things they initiated from things they did not, which means they can tickle themselves. Eagleman hypothesizes this is a timing issue. They may be able to tickle themselves because they often struggle to predict their movements and the following sensations. \"Schizophrenia affects the brain's ability to distinguish self-generated actions from external actions,\" Eagleman said. \"If that prediction system falters, even your own touch can feel surprising.\" Roberta McLain is a science writer and science teacher based north of Boston, Massachusetts.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. What was life really like in Pompeii? This week's science news has revealed some weird details of the lives of the illfated city's inhabitants. First, archaeologists uncovered an extremely rare wall painting depicting an ancient, secretive cult centered around female followers of Dionysus, the god of wine. The fresco portrays a young woman being led by a part-goat, part-human creature through an initiation ceremony. The activities of this cult were kept secret from outsiders, so the fresco offers unprecedented insights into their mysterious practices. And speaking of mysteries, scientists may have caught a first glimpse of the enigmatic shell of icy objects that lies at the edge of our solar system. Scientists believe that, at the edge of our solar system, lies a spherical shell of icy objects, known as the Oort cloud. Exactly what this cosmic casing looks like is unknown, but now NASA supercomputers suggest that the Oort cloud may sport two spiral arms, resembling a miniature galaxy. To confirm the existence of this structure, scientists will need to track comets and objects originating from the Oort cloud directly, or monitor the light that they reflect, both of which are incredibly difficult tasks.

        "text": "Early data suggest that the 2024-2025 flu shots have effectively lowered rates of flu hospitalization and outpatient visits in vaccinated people. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. This year's flu shots have dramatically reduced hospitalizations for seasonal influenza, early data suggest. For kids and teens, the shots were at least 63% effective against flu hospitalizations, and up to 78% in some regions. That's according to data pulled from two networks of health care centers that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors to assess flu shot effectiveness. \"Vaccine effectiveness\" reflects how much a shot lowers the chances of a particular health outcome in the real world, and it's calculated by comparing how often that outcome occurs in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. So in this case, vaccinated kids had a 63% to 78% lower chance of being hospitalized for flu. For people ages 18 and up, the shots were 41% and 55% effective against hospitalization, respectively, in two of the networks. Related: Flu shots have changed this year \u2014 here's why The shots have also reduced the likelihood of outpatient visits for flu, which include normal doctor's visits, as well as urgent care and emergency department visits. For kids and teens, the level of effectiveness was 32%, 59% and 60% in three networks, and for adults, it was 36% and 54% in two networks. These estimates, shared Thursday (Feb. 28) in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), are subject to change as flu season progresses. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. At a glance \u2014 compared with estimates provided for last season's flu shots at this time last year \u2014 the 2024-2025 vaccines appear to be providing greater protection against pediatric hospitalizations. However, they may be less protective against outpatient visits for some kids. Adults' protection, on the other hand, appears to be slightly higher for both types of health care this season. \"Findings in this report show that vaccination with the 2024-2025 influenza vaccine reduced the likelihood of medically attended influenza and support CDC's recommendation that all persons aged \u22656 months be vaccinated against influenza,\" the MMWR noted. \"These findings also support the strong protective effect influenza vaccination has against influenza-associated hospitalization, demonstrating the importance of vaccination to reduce more severe influenza-associated complications,\" it concluded. The authors of the MMWR proposed that a subtype of flu known as H3N2 may explain why the shots have not been as protective against pediatric outpatient visits this season. Human influenza viruses come in two broad types \u2014 classified as either \"A\" or \"B\" \u2014 which are then divided into subtypes and variants. CDC data show that the vast majority of flu cases this year have been caused by influenza A viruses. Officials have genetically analyzed a subset of these A viruses and found that they fall into two subtypes: H1N1 and H3N2. At a national level, H1N1 and H3N2 are each responsible for roughly half of the influenza A cases. However, the ratio of H1N1 to H3N2 varies between regions, and thus different networks. The MMWR suggests that the shots were less protective against pediatric outpatient cases in areas where H3N2 was more prevalent. Lab experiments conducted with ferrets had already suggested that the shots were not nearly as good a \"match\" for the circulating H3N2 viruses as they were for the H1N1 viruses. Nonetheless, this season's flu shots are showing levels of protection \"consistent with those from the 2023-24 season and seasons associated with higher VE [vaccine efficacy] over the last 15 years,\" the MMWR says. Flu season in the United States can run through May, so it's not too late to get a flu shot. Meanwhile, the fate of the next round of flu shots \u2014 for the 2025-2026 season \u2014 is uncertain. Typically, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meets around this time of year to determine which strains should be included in the upcoming season's flu shots. That meeting, scheduled for March 13, has now been canceled without a given reason, Reuters reported, though notably, the newly confirmed head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a longtime vaccine skeptic. Members of the FDA advisory panel and other experts have expressed concern that this cancellation could throw off the carefully timed planning and production cycle for flu shots, The New York Times reported. \u2014The US is having its most active flu season in 15 years \u2014How to avoid bird flu \u2014How do people die of the flu? Flu shot production involves growing viruses in chicken eggs, and that takes time \u2014 there's typically a six-month buffer between the FDA selecting strains and the start of the vaccine rollout in late July or early August, according to NBC. Delaying that strain selection for the U.S. market could mean that manufacturers don't have time to make enough vaccine for the season's start, which could translate to higher rates of serious illness and death. The cancellation of the FDA advisory panel meeting follows the postponement of a different meeting of vaccine advisers to the CDC. That said, the CDC and FDA did recently participate in a World Health Organization (WHO)-led meeting about flu shots, despite the Trump administration's stated intention to withdraw from the WHO, STAT reported. The WHO meeting typically guides the FDA's strain selection for the U.S. market, although the agency can make its own selection for America's vaccines if it chooses. Time will tell if the FDA's vaccine advisers will meet as usual, allowing a window of time for public comment, or if strain selection might otherwise proceed without the meeting.

        "title": "Next ice age would hit Earth in 11,000 years if it weren't for climate change, scientists say | Live Science",
        "text": "Scientists have determined exactly how Earth's orbit and tilt affect glaciation and deglaciation, based on the length of these parameters' cycles and clues hidden at the bottom of the ocean. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Changes in Earth's tilt relative to the sun have governed the movements of giant ice sheets over the past 800,000 years, triggering the start and end of eight ice ages, new research suggests. The new study revealed an \"amazing correlation\" between Earth's tilt and ice sheet formation, said lead author Stephen Barker. Based on these findings, researchers estimated that the next ice age would be well underway in 11,000 years \u2014 were it not for human-driven global warming. \"The prediction is that the next ice age will begin within the next 10,000 years,\" Barker, a professor of Earth science at Cardiff University in the U.K., told Live Science. However, this result does not take into account our ballooning greenhouse gas emissions, which are heating the planet to the point of preventing ice ages, he said. Ice ages, or glacial periods, are extremely cold stretches of time that occur roughly every 100,000 years, covering much of the planet with enormous ice sheets for thousands of years at a time. Glacial periods are separated by warmer interglacial periods, when ice sheets retreat toward the poles. Earth is currently in an interglacial period, with the last glacial period having peaked around 20,000 years ago. Scientists have previously suggested that Earth's position and angle relative to the sun affect ice sheet formation. In the early 1920s, Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovitch proposed that slight changes in Earth's axial tilt and the shape of Earth's orbit could trigger massive glacial events. Researchers have been testing Milankovitch's theory for the past 100 years. Notably, a 1976 study found geological evidence showing that two of Earth's parameters \u2014 obliquity and precession, or changes in Earth's axial tilt and how the axis wobbles around itself, respectively \u2014 play a part in the waxing and waning of ice sheets. But the precise role of either parameter has remained unclear. Related: Giant ice age landforms discovered deep beneath North Sea revealed in amazing detail Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Now, Barker and his colleagues say they've finally untangled these parameters' effects. Earth's axis is currently tilted at a 23.5-degree angle away from vertical as it rotates around the sun, affecting how much solar energy hits each of the poles, in particular. But the tilt of Earth's axis naturally gets bigger and smaller in a cycle that lasts about 41,000 years. The axis also wobbles around itself like an off-center spinning top, affecting how much solar energy reaches equatorial regions during the summer within time periods of about 21,000 years. For the study, the researchers plotted known changes in obliquity and precession over the past 800,000 years. They also plotted the expansion and retreat of ice sheets during this period using existing data from microscopic shells, called forams, in ocean sediment cores. The relative abundance of certain types of oxygen in forams reveals how far ice sheets extended when the organisms were alive, Barker explained. The results from combining these plots were a \"fall off the chair moment,\" Barker said. \"We found this amazing correlation [...] that says there's a direct relationship between the phasing of obliquity and precession, and then the resulting duration of how long it takes the ice sheets to decay,\" he said. Put simply, ice sheet expansion from the poles toward the equator appears to be directly governed by obliquity. The retreat of ice sheets from the equator back to the poles, on the other hand, is more dependent on precession. The researchers revealed their findings in a study published Thursday (Feb. 27) in the journal Science. The results are perhaps unsurprising, given that obliquity and precession affect how much sunlight reaches polar and equatorial regions, respectively, Barker said. \"Depending on where you are on Earth, you'll find more influence from precession or obliquity,\" he said. \u2014Earth is wobbling and days are getting longer \u2014 and humans are to blame \u2014Earth\u2019s days once got 2 hours longer \u2014 and that may have triggered one of the biggest evolutionary explosions in history, study suggests \u2014Human impact on Earth's tilt leaves researchers 'surprised and concerned' The plots were so neat that the scientists extrapolated the data and estimated when the next glacial period would occur if the climate was changing only according to natural cycles, Barker said. More research is needed to pin the timings down, but ice sheets would likely start expanding in around 10,000 to 11,000 years and reach their maximum extent within the following 80,000 to 90,000 years. They would then take another 10,000 years to retreat to the poles. There is much debate around the timing of the next glaciation, but most experts agree that humans are disrupting these cycles through global warming. \"If CO2 stays high, you won't get a new glaciation,\" Barker said. That's not to say that cooking the planet is a good idea, Barker cautioned. \"What we don't want is for people who want to emit more CO2 into the atmosphere to jump on this,\" he said. Rather, the point of this study and future research is to build a picture of what the climate would do over the next 10,000 to 20,000 years without the impact of human activity, Barker said. The goal is then to provide a long-term estimate of humanity\u2019s impact on the planet, he said. Sascha is a U.K.-based staff writer at Live Science.

        "title": "'It's extremely worrisome.' NASA's James Webb Space Telescope faces potential 20% budget cut just 4 years after launch | Live Science",
        "text": "Such a dramatic cut to a flagship space telescope still in its prime will be felt across the mission's entire operations, affecting science. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. The scientists behind NASA's largest and most powerful space telescope ever built are bracing for potentially crippling budget cuts, and the observatory is only halfway through its primary mission. The team overseeing NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been directed to prepare for up to 20% in budget cuts that would touch on every aspect of the flagship observatory's operations, which are managed by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Maryland. The potential cut comes even as the space observatory is more in demand than ever before, with astronomers requesting the equivalent of nine years' worth of Webb observing time in one operational year. \"NASA is having budget constraints across the entire board, so the institute is being asked to consider a significant \u2014 about 20% \u2014 cut to our operational budget for the mission starting later this year,\" Tom Brown, who leads the Webb mission office at STScI, told a crowd of scientists last month at the 245th American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. \"So the impacts of that, if it comes to pass, pretty much cut across the entire mission.\" NASA's $25.4 billion budget request for 2025 set aside $317 million to fund the Webb space telescope, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory that together comprise NASA's currently operational \"Great Observatories.\" The Hubble Telescope program is facing a potential 20% budget cut of its own, according to SpaceNews. And Chandra is facing the end of its mission, with NASA's 2025 budget request including plans to wind down operations, with its budget dropping from $41.1 million this year to just $5.2 million in 2029. But unlike Hubble, which turns 35 this spring, and Chandra, which launched in 1999, Webb is in its prime, approaching the midpoint of a primary 10-year mission. It could last at least 20 years or more, NASA officials have said. The mission is an international partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. \"Frankly, this mission works far better than, really, most folks expected it to, you know,\" Brown said during the Webb town hall event on Jan. 15 at the AAS conference. \"It's extremely worrisome that, while we're in the middle of the prime mission, we're also maybe looking at significant budget cuts.\" The $10 billion Webb space telescope survived a tumultuous development process, one that included cost overruns and technical delays that nearly killed the observatory before it ever flew. Lawmakers with the House Appropriations Committee proposed cancelling the mission in 2011, a decade before Webb's Christmas Day launch in 2021, only to back down after backlash from scientists and influential politicians defending the observatory. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Since its 2021 launch, the Webb space telescope has outmatched even the most optimistic predictions for its performance. Its infrared optics have looked deep into the universe's past, observed distant galaxies and exoplanets, and even peered at our own local solar system planets closer to home. \"In a nutshell, it is truly fulfilling its promise,\" Macarena Garcia Marin, STScI's Webb project scientist, said during the same town hall event. \"Across every field, JWST is truly delivering cutting-edge science.\" Some of Webb's budget challenges stem from its operational costs, which were set \"idealistically low\" in 2011 when the observatory was saved from cancellation. Those costs, coupled with inflation rates that were much higher than expected and less flexibility in NASA's budget, have also contributed, Brown said. According to a presentation by Brown, a 20% cut to Webb's operational budget would definitely affect how much science the telescope could perform. The impacts would be felt across teams that review proposals for observing targets, data analysis, observatory efficiencies, and anomaly resolution when something goes wrong, not to mention the need to engage with the scientific community and public on Webb's science results. \"It's a huge cut. That's not like kind of trying to nibble away at the edges,\" Brown told Space.com. \"That impacts everything across the board, all the way up to how many modes we're offering to the observers.\" \u2014'Utterly cataclysmic': James Webb telescope spots 2 alien planets disintegrating before our eyes \u2014Space photo of the week: James Webb telescope reveals mysterious 'light echo' in the broken heart of Cassiopeia \u2014James Webb Space Telescope reveals how a cosmic 'Phoenix' cools off to birth stars Those impacts, Brown said, would likely be felt for the first time in October, when the next fiscal year begins. Brown's comments at the Webb observatory town hall at AAS came just before the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who in subsequent weeks created the Department of Government Efficiency headed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to reduce government spending. DOGE, as it's known, has worked to dismantle some entire agencies, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides aid to other countries during disasters and other emergencies, while also overseeing massive cuts to the federal workforce. Nearly 1,000 NASA jobs could be eliminated, though they appear to have been saved from layoffs earlier this week. Trump has nominated American billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who has flown in orbit twice on private SpaceX missions he financed himself, to serve as the next NASA administrator, though Isaacman has yet to be confirmed. The agency is currently being led by Acting Administrator Janet Petro, former director of the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Originally posted on Space.com.

        "text": "An outbreak of measles in Texas has infected 124 people so far \u2014 18 of whom have subsequently been hospitalized and one who has died. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. An ongoing outbreak of measles in Texas has so far hospitalized 18 people and infected 106 others, state officials say. One death was confirmed on Feb. 26 by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). On Feb. 26, Robert F. Kennedy Jr incorrectly said two deaths had occurred, but at that time, only the unvaccinated child in Texas had died. The deceased was a school-age child who was not vaccinated and was hospitalized in Lubbock last week. They are the first person to die of measles in the U.S. since 2015. As of Feb. 25, 124 cases of measles have been reported in the South Plains region in northwest Texas since late January, according to a statement from DSHS. Five of the cases occurred in people who had been vaccinated against the disease, while the rest affected people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. The majority of cases \u2014 more than 100 \u2014 have sickened people under the age of 17. The South Plains region includes two dozen counties, and of these, Gaines County and Terry County have been most affected by the outbreak, with 80 and 21 cases, respectively. \"Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,\" the DSHS said in the statement. \"DSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\" Related: 300 people possibly exposed to measles at California hospital Elsewhere in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has officially confirmed 93 cases of measles in eight states so far in 2025. These cases have occurred in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas. The CDC has stated that it would update this count every Friday beginning on Feb. 21, which may explain the potential discrepancy in case numbers with the DSHS. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Experts say that the spread of measles in Texas is likely due to low vaccination rates \u2014 for example, nearly 18% of school-age children in Gaines County have exemptions from at least one vaccine, NBC News reported. In addition, the rapid spread of the disease may be worsened by delays in diagnosis, as symptoms can take up to two weeks to emerge after exposure to the virus, and because the disease is extremely contagious. Here's what you need to know about measles, how it spreads and how you can protect yourself and your loved ones against the illness. Measles is a potentially deadly respiratory infection caused by a virus known as Measles morbillivirus, or simply \"the measles virus.\" The disease exclusively affects humans, meaning it does not infect animals. Measles is spread from one person to another via droplets in the air, which are released when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, for example. \"[Measles] is probably one of the most contagious viruses that's ever existed,\" Dr. Ashley Stephens, an assistant professor and pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, told Live Science. Once released into the air from an infected person, droplets containing the measles virus can remain airborne for two hours. Anyone who is nearby who isn't yet immune to the virus then has a 90% chance of also becoming infected if they then breathe in these droplets. The basic reproduction number of measles \u2014 an estimate of the average number of susceptible people that an infected individual would pass the illness to \u2014 is typically cited as 12 to 18. Estimates for seasonal flu, by comparison, fall between 1 and 2. People usually develop symptoms of measles within seven to 14 days of being exposed to the virus. Common initial symptoms of the disease include a high fever, cough and runny nose, as well as red, watery eyes. After a few days, the characteristic red rash associated with measles appears, typically first on the head before then spreading to the rest of the body. The rash starts out as flat, red spots, and later on, small raised bumps may emerge on top of the spots. The spots can end up joining together as they spread over the body. Some people additionally get small white spots that appear inside their cheeks and on the backs of their lips, known as Koplik spots. Measles can go on to cause serious complications, including pneumonia and swelling of the brain, known as encephalitis. These complications are more likely to happen in certain groups, such as children who are under the age of 5, pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems. Approximately 1 to 3 children per 1,000 who are infected with measles die of it, namely from respiratory or neurologic complications. \"Measles is a very dangerous virus, and many people that get infected \u2014 particularly children under age 5 \u2014 are at high risk of getting really sick from it,\" Stephens said. Unfortunately, there is really no good treatment for measles, Stephens added. The disease must run its course, which normally stakes between 10 and 14 days in those who survive. In the meantime, patients may be prescribed drugs to help manage their symptoms, such as acetaminophen for pain relief and to treat fever. For those who survive a bout of measles, they can still have ongoing health problems afterward. In particular, measles is known to induce a kind of amnesia of the immune system \u2014 people end up with immunity against future measles infections, but they become vulnerable to other germs they've encountered in the past. (This \"immune amnesia\" is most profound in unvaccinated people; the few vaccinated individuals that still catch measles don't suffer these same knock-on impacts.) Related: US has already had more measles cases in 2024 than all of 2023 According to the CDC, 16 outbreaks of measles were reported in the U.S. in 2024, while four were reported in 2023. An outbreak, in this context, means three or more related cases of the disease, the CDC notes. Before the measles vaccine became available in the U.S. in the 1960s, between three and four million people were infected with the virus every year, and about 500 died. Then, thanks to an effective national vaccination program and improved measles control across North and South America, measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. For a disease to be \"eliminated,\" its transmission must be stopped within a specific geographical area; \"eradication,\" by contrast, means a disease has effectively been made extinct worldwide. Measles is still prevalent elsewhere in the world, so cases can occasionally be imported into the U.S. This can happen when people get infected with measles while traveling overseas and then reenter the country, for example. These imported cases can then spark outbreaks within the U.S. The best way to avoid getting sick from measles is to be immunized with two doses of the measles vaccine. Most often, people are vaccinated with measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the DSHS said in their statement. Another option is the MMRV vaccine, which also protects against varicella, the chickpox virus. However, the MMR vaccine is generally recommended over the MMRV because it's less likely to trigger fevers in children. Children should get their first dose of the MMR vaccine when they are between the ages of 12 and 15 months old, followed by a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. The schedule for the MMRV vaccine is the same. Teenagers and adults who have received neither dose or only one dose of the MMR vaccine are also eligible to receive it, whereas the MMRV vaccine is only approved for people up to age 12. That said, certain adults shouldn't get a MMR vaccine, including people who are pregnant. One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, and that protection rises to 97% following the administration of the second dose. Evidence suggests that people who are fully vaccinated are protected for life against measles, without the need for a booster dose. Stephens said that anyone who is concerned about the risk that they or their children get sick from measles should contact their doctor. Their health care provider will also be able to answer any questions concerning the MMR vaccine, she added. \"We understand that many people have found misinformation, so they might have seen something about the MMR vaccine that made them concerned,\" she said. \u2014Measles deaths jumped over 40% from 2021 to 2022, CDC reports \u2014Maine sees its 1st measles case in four years \u2014Measles-infected person exposed 'undetermined' number of people at huge Kentucky spiritual revival One piece of misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine is that it causes autism \u2014 a claim that originated in the late 1990s after a now thoroughly debunked paper was published in the journal The Lancet. The paper purported a link between the vaccine and autism, but its methods were flawed, its data deliberately falsified and its author had a clear conflict of interest. The paper was ultimately retracted. Despite the overwhelming evidence against it, the link between vaccines and autism is still used by anti-vaccine campaigners to smear the MMR vaccine \u2014 a sentiment that has previously been echoed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the current United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. Anti-vaccine campaign groups are also presently inaccurately suggesting that the vaccine itself is causing the current outbreak in Texas, NBC News reports.

        "text": "Cancer vaccines harness the power of the immune system to stop tumors in their tracks. They work a little differently than regular vaccines intended to prevent infectious diseases, like measles or the flu. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Vaccines for infectious diseases have changed the trajectory of humankind. In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed more than 300 million people worldwide, and polio killed or paralyzed half a million people each year. Today, thanks to vaccines, smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, meaning it's essentially extinct; and polio has been eliminated in many countries, so the disease is no longer endemic to those places. With the success of vaccines for infectious diseases in mind, scientists have wondered if it might be possible to similarly harness the power of the immune system against other conditions. Now, researchers are working to develop vaccines for cancer. But what, exactly, are cancer vaccines, and how do they work? Related: The 10 deadliest cancers, and why there's no cure Vaccines, broadly, are substances that train the immune system to defend the body against a dangerous invader. They help the immune system recognize a pathogen by exposing the body to key features of that germ, such as proteins from a virus's surface. These features are called antigens, and when they're introduced through a vaccine, the immune system learns to recognize them as a threat. Once the immune system becomes familiar with antigens from a virus or bacterium, it will then be able to quickly mount an attack against that pathogen if it ever comes into contact with the bona fide germ. That's how vaccines stop people from contracting infectious diseases, such as smallpox or measles. If a vaccine doesn't completely block an infection from happening, it can still make the resulting illness much less dangerous \u2014 think of the annual flu shot. \"They [vaccines] harness the inbuilt ability of our immune systems to recognize something that is foreign to our bodies,\" Dr. Vinod Balachandran, director of the Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, told Live Science. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Some common vaccines against infectious diseases already help prevent cancer. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, for example, protects against the strains of HPV that are most likely to cause cervical cancer, and the hepatitis B vaccine protects against liver cancer caused by chronic hepatitis B infections. But these vaccines don't actually target the cancer itself; they instead take aim at viruses that increase the risk of cancer. In contrast, when scientists talk about a \"cancer vaccine,\" they're referring to a vaccine that targets cancer directly, rather than using the indirect methods mentioned above, Balachandran said. Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer with a vaccine is tricky, though, because vaccines rely on the immune system's recognition of a pathogen as a foreign invader. But cancer grows from our own cells \u2014 and that means the genetic and molecular compositions of a cancer cell are relatively similar to those of a healthy one. However, certain molecules are found only in cancer cells, and researchers are attempting to use those molecules to train the immune system to fight cancer. They call these molecules neoantigens, and they're introduced to healthy cells through processes such as genetic mutation. \"If you can identify the neoantigens in a cancer that the immune system can recognize, you can teach the immune system to recognize a cancer as foreign,\" Balachandran explained. There are some neoantigens that everyone with a certain type of cancer may have, but neoantigens can also be specific to an individual. Researchers are still investigating the most effective neoantigens to target for different types of cancer. Unlike vaccines for infectious diseases, Balachandran said, cancer vaccines will likely need to be designed for individual patients, or made in small batches, to ensure they're targeting these different neoantigens efficiently. In his own lab, Balachandran is conducting small trials with human patients to develop a vaccine for a deadly form of pancreatic cancer. After surgically removing patients' tumors, Balachandran gave the participants a regimen of immune-boosting and chemotherapy drugs alongside a personalized vaccine that targets specific neoantigens seen in their tumors. The vaccines contain mRNA, a genetic molecule that, in this case, carries blueprints for the neoantigens. Once inside the patient, the vaccine enables cells to build those neoantigens and show them to the immune system. Related: New mRNA vaccine for deadly brain cancer triggers a strong immune response Half of the vaccinated patients in the 16-person trial showed a boost in cancer-fighting immune molecules, and their cancers didn't return for the duration of the 18-month study. These results suggest that, at least in some patients, personalized cancer vaccines could decrease the likelihood that deadly cancers will return. Balachandran explained that currently, many cancer vaccines are targeted at what physicians call \"secondary prevention.\" This means that they're designed to stop cancer from returning in a person that's currently in remission, rather than preventing cancer from emerging in the first place. That said, there are also therapeutic cancer vaccines that can treat existing cancers. These work like immunotherapies for cancer, by revving up the immune system to fight tumors. As of 2025, one therapeutic cancer vaccine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This vaccine, called sipuleucel-T (brand name Provenge), helps direct the immune system to attack a typically incurable form of prostate cancer. The vaccine contains a patient's own cells, which have been \"activated\" in the lab through exposure to a prostate-cancer protein. Trials suggest the treatment extends patients' survival by a few months. \u2014'I've never seen anything like this': Scientists hijack cancer genes to turn tumors against themselves \u2014Cervical cancer deaths have plummeted among young women, US study finds \u2014New treatment for most aggressive brain cancer may help patients live longer Scientists are investigating many more cancer vaccines, including some for brain cancer and skin cancer, in clinical trials. Different vaccines are at different points in the clinical trial process; some are still in early research, whereas others, such as Merck and Moderna's vaccine for melanoma, are in the final stage of clinical trials.. If current efforts to design cancer vaccines for secondary prevention are successful, Balachandran hopes that researchers could one day design cancer vaccines for primary prevention \u2014 stopping people from ever developing cancer in the first place. A vaccine for primary prevention would work more like a traditional shot for infectious diseases by blocking the condition from ever emerging. \"If we now know that the immune system can also recognize cancer, it should, in theory, be possible to develop a vaccine against cancer, like we have been able to do against pathogens,\" Balachandran said. \"It's an exciting time for the field right now.\" This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.

        "text": "A yet-unidentified illness has killed 53 people and potentially infected hundreds more in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The World Health Organization is investigating the outbreak. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. An unidentified illness has killed more than 50 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since mid-January, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Health officials reported the first cases of the mysterious disease in the northwestern village of Boloko. The start of the outbreak was traced back to three young children who died between Jan. 10 and Jan. 13. The children reportedly ate a bat before developing symptoms, which started as a fever, headache, diarrhea and fatigue and later progressed to more severe symptoms, such as vomiting blood, WHO's Regional Office for Africa reported. Additional cases of the illness appeared in Boloko over the following days, and more happened in the nearby village of Danda. By Jan. 27, Boloko had recorded 10 cases, including seven deaths, and Danda reported two cases and one death. Then, on Feb. 13, health authorities reported a second cluster of illnesses in Bomate, another village in northwest Congo. As of Feb. 15, there have been 431 cases and 53 deaths reported between the two regions, according to the report. Related: Inexpensive new malaria vaccine is a 'vital tool' to protect tens of millions of people This data reflects a case-fatality rate of just over 12%, with nearly half of the fatalities occurring within 48 hours of symptoms developing. However, the circumstances by which people become exposed to the illness have not been established, the report notes. Officials also haven't found clear indications of disease spread between the two outbreak locations \u2014 with Boloko and Danda in one zone and Bomate in another. In other words, the two outbreaks could potentially be separate illnesses. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. \"The remote geography and limited healthcare infrastructure exacerbate response challenges, with overwhelmed health facilities struggling to manage cases,\" the report says. \"Despite ongoing response efforts, significant gaps remain, including limited laboratory capacity, unclear transmission dynamics, and weak surveillance.\" There is currently little information about the illnesses in Bomate, Boloko and Danda, but the WHO investigation is ongoing. Notably, officials did send samples from 13 cases in the Bomate outbreak to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the nation's capital, the report states. The main symptoms seen in the reported cases have included fever, chills, headache, body aches, sweating, neck stiffness, cough, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some have also involved nosebleeds, vomiting blood and tarry, black stool. These symptoms can also be seen in hemorrhagic fevers, a group of diseases caused by several families of viruses found in animals, including bats and rodents. However, the samples from Bomate came back negative for common viruses behind hemorrhagic fever, namely Ebola and Marburg viruses, the report says. Five clinical samples from Boloko and Danda were also sent off for analysis, and those also came back negative for Ebola and Marburg. Some of the samples from Bomate did come back positive for the parasitic disease malaria, which is endemic to Africa and kills hundreds of thousands on the continent each year. In the fall and winter of 2024, an outbreak of illness in the Panzi health zone in southwestern Congo turned out to be caused, at least in part, by malaria. At first, it was difficult to attribute the illnesses to malaria, because at that time of year, many people in the area carry parasites in their blood but might not show symptoms. A lack of labs in the health zone made it difficult to run diagnostics and rule out other causes of the illnesses. There was also at least one case of what seemed to be hemorrhagic fever, which complicated the picture. Regarding the new mystery outbreaks, the WHO regional office said that diagnoses under investigation include malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis. \u2014New 'Camp Hill' virus discovered in Alabama is relative of deadly Nipah \u2014 the 1st of its kind in the US \u2014US reports 1st outbreak of 'highly pathogenic' H5N9 virus in poultry. Should we worry? \u2014Parasite lurking in woman's brain caused mysterious 'burning' leg sensation According to a 2022 WHO report, there was a 63% surge in the number of disease outbreaks spread from animals to humans in Africa between 2012 and 2022. Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers made up nearly 70% of those outbreaks, with most of the increase observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. Part of the increase could possibly be attributed to enhanced surveillance and testing in these countries \u2014 in other words, more outbreaks are being documented than before. But the WHO report also pointed to population growth and urban expansion leading to humans encroaching on wildlife habitats, potentially leading to more chances for diseases to jump from animals to people.

        "title": "'Have the cure and eat it' too: How cannibalism changed from a pagan rite to Christian medicine | Live Science",
        "text": "Cannibalism has been documented across Western Europe, from prehistory into the 1800s. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. The modern history of Western Europe is defined by opposition. Europe is presented as a beacon of civilization facing down the barbarous masses that populated the rest of the world, and one of the customs that, for centuries, stood between Europeans and the rest of the world was cannibalism. While it is often portrayed as one of the cruellest and most horrifying practices imaginable, my recent research shows that humans ingested other humans' body parts in Western Europe, both in prehistoric times and throughout the centuries that followed. The reasons for this practice ranged from nutritional needs to the religious and healing practices documented in various periods. In the Middle Ages, there are references to how cannibalism was recurrent in periods of famine, war, unrest and other testing times for social coexistence. However, there was also a form of cannibalism that considered some parts of the human body to serve a medicinal purpose. For centuries, the dismembered human body was seen as just another material to be used in all manner of remedies and cures. Between the end of Roman antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages, laws appeared in both the Codex Theosianus and the Visigothic Code referring to the prohibition of violating graves or tombs. It was also forbidden to desecrate them in order to extract any kind of remedy derived from the human body, such as blood. Therefore, from the 7th century onwards, there were already laws inherited from earlier times that regulated or punished seeing tombs and human remains as a source of curative materials. The Roman and Visigothic prohibitions were not the only ones in Europe, and over time, other normative texts appeared. These laws only existed, and proliferated, because the practice itself persisted. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Related: Ancient Europeans ate the brains of their dead enemies 18,000 years ago, researchers discover With the establishment of Christianity came the Handbooks of Penance: books or sets of rules listing sins and their corresponding penances. These reflected early medieval ecclesiastical concerns in regulating society \u2014 what was right and wrong, what could and could not be done \u2014 in terms of both violence and sexuality. For instance, the Hibernian Canons forbade drinking blood or urine, under penalty of seven years on bread and water under the supervision of a bishop. At the end of the 7th century, other penitentials determined the impurity of animals that had fed on human flesh or blood, and forbade eating them. The most famous penitential of its time, that of Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, makes two mentions of the prohibition of ingesting blood or semen, addressed in particular to women who drank the blood of their husbands for its curative properties. Once again, we see that these products are cited as remedies, just as in the Visigothic Code. This prohibition is repeated in the penitential of the Monte Cassino monastery. Likewise in Spanish penitentials, the ingestion of semen, or its addition to food, is again punished. The prohibitions affected women in particular and referred to the power they could obtain from male blood or menstrual blood, due to its therapeutic or magical character. Prohibiting such practices implied that there was a reality that needed to be regulated and controlled. From the beginning of Christianity, the ambiguity of its own rituals had led to misunderstandings, such as its practitioners being regarded as cannibals who ingested human sacrifices in honour of their God. In time, some Christians would come to direct this accusation against the Jews in medieval Europe. Allegations of cruelty were also directed at other 'heretics' such as the Cataphyrgians, whose eucharist supposedly consisted of mixing children's blood with flour. As local saints became more prominent, their miraculous character, as well as access to their burial sites, meant that their bodies were also used for cures and remedies after their deaths. However, in contrast to other practices that were totally forbidden, contact cannibalism \u2014 the ingestion of products that had merely touched the body of the saint or their relics \u2014 was permitted. Oils that had passed through the tomb, along with water and even dust and stones from holy burial sites, were ingested in order to seek the healing and the miraculous effects of these \"fragments of eternity\". There was thus a shift from consuming the dead (thanatophagy) to consuming the sacred (hagiophagy). One story that demonstrates the attempts by Christian literature to put a stop to these cruel, supposedly pagan practices is the legend of Pope Saint Sylvester I and the curing of Emperor Constantine's leprosy. The tale spread across Europe, not only through oral narratives recounting the miracles of the saint's life, but also in painting and sculpture. According to the story, Emperor Constantine suffered terribly from leprosy. On his doctors' recommendation, he decided to bathe in blood, which would be obtained by killing thousands of children. However, when Constantine was on his way to sacrifice the children, Saint Sylvester and the children's mothers managed to persuade him to abandon the cure and be baptised instead, which miraculously cured his illness. The story highlights pagan beliefs as cruel and lacking in respect for the human body, and is intended to convey the power of Christian faith in opposition to the vile superstitions that preceded it. From its possible Italian source, the legend travelled throughout Europe, and reached as far as the tenth-century monastic writings of northern Castile. \u2014Scientists discover what could be the oldest evidence of cannibalism among ancient human relatives \u2014Cannibal animals: 12 creatures that gobble up their own kind \u2014Decapitated woman found in Irish bog is 2,000-year-old ritual sacrifice In the Modern Age, and even in the 19th century, several dictionaries of materials \u2014 such as Jos\u00e9 Oriol Ronquillo's 1855 publication, which was in turn taken from another French dictionary from 1759 \u2014 still mentioned parts of the human body (fat, blood and urine) as having curative properties. These beliefs are closely linked to romantic literature, with its array of vampires, werewolves and other human-esque creatures hungry for flesh and blood. However, long before the 1800s, and even before the colonisation of America or Africa, cannibalism was a key part of the cultural struggle between supposed pagan barbarism and Christianity. Christianity, however, did not completely abandon the practice, but rather refined it, seeking in contact with relics, or even in their ingestion, a way to both have the cure and eat it.

        "title": "Trump executive order calls mental health prescriptions a 'threat' \u2014 why? | Live Science",
        "text": "A federal commission to examine U.S. chronic disease could undercut real treatment for kids with depression, ADHD and other mental health challenges When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Our teenagers are in trouble. Headlines have been ringing loud alarms around adolescent mental health, and the data are sobering. In 2023, 40 percent of high school students surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they persistently felt hopeless or sad in the past year. Nine percent had attempted suicide. Some of it is because of COVID. Some of it is related to social media. Then there is bullying, the pressure to succeed academically, the pressure to fit in. Being a teenager in the U.S. is hard. So it's perhaps heartening to see President Donald Trump address mental health in a recent executive order (EO) targeting chronic health issues in children, one released as soon as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was confirmed as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services. But nestled in this directive, which creates an RFK, Jr.\u2013chaired commission to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" are words that speak to the doubt that he and Trump have tried to sow around established science. This includes suggestions that the research funded by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies isn't \"gold standard\" and assertions that doctors are overprescribing medicines for conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression and that \"medical treatments\" might be part of the pediatric chronic disease problem. Perhaps most troubling is the language the administration uses to describe prescription medications for mood and behavior disorders \u2014 they are a \"threat.\" That language stigmatizes families who choose prescription medication to treat their struggling children. It undermines the expertise of medical professionals. And it opens the door for unproven, improperly studied treatments to gain legitimacy. The next era of snake oil dawns. Won't anyone think of the children? Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. According to the CDC, in 2021 and 2022, more than half of U.S. teens talked to a health care provider about their mental health. About 14 percent of teens reported taking medication to manage their emotional state or for concentration and behavior. Yet 20 percent said they have unmet mental health needs. The Affordable Care Act, and before it, the federal parity law, introduced a lot of Americans, including perhaps these teens' parents, to parity in mental health coverage \u2014 in theory, insurance plans can't deny mental health coverage, charge ridiculous rates for coverage that included mental health or put limits on the amount of mental health coverage a plan allows. But even if you have insurance, depending on where you live, finding mental health care for children can be incredibly difficult. Many providers, whether therapists or psychiatrists, don't take insurance, or don't take certain plans. This includes Medicaid but also large commercial plans. Many primary care doctors, including pediatricians, have limits on what aspects of mental health care they are comfortable managing, including medication. In rural parts of the U.S., there are hundreds of counties that do not have a single child psychiatrist. Related: At-home brain stimulation could be promising depression treatment, trial hints Then there is the public education system, bound to provide a suitable education for all children, thrust in the role of mental health adviser. For many children in the U.S., appropriate services first become available when a teacher, an aide, a counselor or another professional says, 'Hey, I think this kid needs help,' or when a kid demonstrates concerning behavior. This is admirable and necessary \u2014 one estimate says about 70 percent of mental health services that kids get happen at school. If you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, help is available. Call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or use the online Lifeline Chat. But now some states are suing the federal government to render Section 504 educational accommodations for those children, and others with disabilities, unconstitutional because it was modified by the Biden administration to recognize youth who are LGBTQ. This is the cruelty and the inconsistency of this executive order. Children who are LGBTQ have some of the largest rates of depression and anxiety in this country. Some 41 percent considered suicide in 2022\u20132023. And now we have a government trying to erase their very being from health care data, or at least to tell people who visit certain federal health care websites that the administration doesn't believe the science and evidence around gender. (Those stats from the CDC come from reports that were temporarily pulled down at the beginning of the Trump administration as part of a push to remove references to gender and sexuality that do not align with the male-female binary that drives conservative ideology.) So what might come of the Trump administration's decision to examine our children's mental health? Federal funding for conversion therapy to \"cure\" LGBTQ teen depression? RFK, Jr., steering taxpayer dollars to the addiction-treating labor camps that he calls \"wellness farms\"? Pushing clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine to treat mood disorders (remember this from COVID?) or promoting something like juicing as a treatment for depression? This is speculation, of course, but the broader question of whether Kennedy will, with the administration's blessing, use tax dollars to promote untested, ineffective or harmful treatments remains. Kennedy is a litigator who is now running our nation's most comprehensive health care agency. He is not a doctor, not a health care specialist, but a litigator \u2014 and one who kept saying during his confirmation hearings that he wanted to see the data that support the health care he has been desperately trying to undermine for the past decade. He is a litigator who once called people on certain antidepression drugs \"addicts\" and who has (falsely) claimed that it is harder to quit selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \u2014 drugs like Prozac \u2014 than heroin. Meanwhile the second Trump administration guts health care agencies when it could be doing what the first Trump administration did during COVID and facilitating telemedicine so that more children can access therapy and psychiatry. The administration pulls data and questions, just for the sake of it, the validity of what data we have. The EO says the administration will work with insurers to increase access, but what does that mean? Our medical schools are not graduating enough child psychiatrists.

        "text": "Animals can be born with genetic or developmental issues that make it hard for them to live normal lives. They also can develop mental health problems in response to conditions around them. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. Max was a fun-loving Labrador retriever who enjoyed going for car rides and greeting clients at his owner's office. But around age 16, Max suddenly started having accidents in the house and stopped sleeping well at night. He became irritable and seemed not to understand the words and commands he had long known. Max was showing symptoms of a disorder called cognitive dysfunction syndrome, which can affect cats and dogs as they age. In dogs, it looks very similar to Alzheimer's disease, which causes memory loss and dementia in humans, usually as they grow older. I study how humans and other animals learn, and my research involves working with many different species, from bees to pigeons and crawfish. Part of my work involves paying attention to conditions that can affect mental health in animals. Sometimes genetic or developmental changes affect how the brain is built, which can lead to mental disabilities or learning differences. In other cases, animals may be exposed to scary or stressful situations that can cause mental health problems. Here are some examples: Down syndrome is a common genetic condition that can slow down learning and thinking in humans. People born with Down syndrome may have a harder time learning new things, remembering information and making complicated decisions. Down syndrome is caused by changes to a chromosome \u2014 the strands in our cells that store our genes. Normally, people have 23 pairs of chromosomes; when someone is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21, it produces the effects of Down syndrome. Most animals can't have Down syndrome, because their genes are organized into chromosomes differently than human genes. However, our closest relatives, including chimpanzees and orangutans, do have a similar organization of genes. Conditions very much like Down syndrome have been observed in these species. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. One example, Kanako, was a female chimpanzee born in a research facility in Japan. She had vision and heart problems caused by an extra chromosome. Scientists don't know whether Kanako had trouble with learning, because her vision problems made that difficult to test. However, Kanako enjoyed socializing with other chimpanzees and lived a long life in a wildlife sanctuary. Wild chimpanzees are probably also sometimes born with genetic conditions like Down syndrome, but the effects make it difficult to survive in the wild, just like being born with a heart or a foot that doesn't develop normally. Kanako was able to live a healthy life thanks to the help of her human caretakers and good veterinary care. Related: 32 animals that act weirdly human sometimes Animals that are born healthy can also develop mental health problems in response to conditions around them. For example, just as soldiers may develop post-traumatic stress disorder after experiencing a life-threatening situation, working military and police dogs can develop a similar condition. Dogs with canine PTSD may cling to their owners, startle at everyday noises, or frequently act panicky or fearful. Veterinarians can prescribe anti-anxiety medication to help these dogs stay calm during scary events, like fireworks or thunderstorms. Owners also can use behavioral treatments to reward the dogs for staying calm and relaxed around things that seem frightening. Most traumatic events, like earthquakes or car accidents, can't be predicted in advance. However, in some cases, such as capturing and restraining a wild animal to relocate it, workers use tranquilizers or sedatives to make the animal sleepy, or cover its eyes and ears to reduce fear and prevent long-lasting problems. Another common cause of mental health problems in animals is daily stress. Animals held in captivity at zoos, farms or research labs may experience stress from sources such as traffic noises, uncomfortable temperatures or not being able to engage in certain natural behaviors. Animals have many signature behaviors: Penguins swim, meerkats dig, baboons socialize and chickens take dust baths. When animals can't do important behaviors, they may experience stress and mental problems. To keep this from happening, zookeepers and animal caretakers provide environmental enrichment \u2014 objects, structures and activities that stimulate the animals' minds and help keep them from getting bored. Sometimes it's easy to see when animals are stressed or anxious. They may pace back and forth, spend their days in hiding or be unusually aggressive. Getting sick frequently or losing weight can also be a sign of poor mental health. Certain hormones, called corticosteroids, can be measured from a poop sample to provide clues about whether an animal is under too much stress. Even pets in loving homes can experience mental health problems. Some dogs struggle with separation anxiety \u2014 extreme fear of being left alone by their owner. Lack of mental or physical activity can also produce anxiety symptoms. \u2014Are cats and dogs smarter than babies? \u2014Can animals learn another species' 'language?' \u2014Do animals have friends? Whether it means taking your dog to the dog park to run and socialize, or building puzzles that hide treats for your parakeet to find, keeping animals busy is good for them. In more serious cases, veterinarians can prescribe medication or behavioral treatments to help your pet feel better. Humans can use science to understand the many conditions that affect mental health in animals and find treatments to help them. We also can show compassion and care for others \u2014 whether human or animal \u2014 who experience mental problems. Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages.

        "title": "Dozens sickened and 12 dead in Listeria outbreak linked to frozen shakes | Live Science",
        "text": "An ongoing Listeria outbreak has mostly affected people living in long-term care facilities and people who were already hospitalized prior to becoming sick from the infection. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. An ongoing Listeria outbreak has so far sickened 38 people across 21 U.S. states, and 12 of the affected individuals have died since the start of the outbreak in 2018. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the outbreak Friday (Feb. 21), and the following day, the foodservice company Lyons Magnus issued a voluntary recall of two products: four-ounce Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial Frozen Supplemental Shakes. These frozen shakes were distributed primarily to long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, and were not available for retail sale, the recall notes. Listeriosis, the infection caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, is particularly dangerous for adults over 65 and for people with weakened immune systems. Newborns and pregnant people also face a higher risk of severe infections than the general public. In the current outbreak, the people affected have ranged from 43 to 101 years old. Listeria infections either affect the intestines, causing symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting, or can spread beyond the intestines to cause \"invasive\" disease, which is typically more severe. Invasive infections can cause fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures. Listeriosis is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., killing about 260 people a year. Related: How does E. coli get into food? The two affected brands of frozen shakes are distributed by Lyons Magnus and are manufactured and supplied by a second company, called Prairie Farms Dairy. Lyons Magnus initiated the recall after becoming aware of potential L. monocytogenes contamination at the Prairie Farms facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As of Feb. 24, federal health officials have connected 38 infections to the outbreak, and 37 cases resulted in hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 12 deaths affected people in California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. \"The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,\" the CDC noted. This is partly because symptoms of Listeria infection may take two weeks to appear, and it then takes additional time to link an illness to an outbreak. The earliest cases linked to the outbreak took place in August 2018, and the most recent was recorded on January 23, 2025. The CDC had actually looked into this outbreak before, but previously, investigations didn't reveal a source of the infection. \"CDC investigated this outbreak in 2018, 2021, and 2023,\" the CDC statement reads. Evidence at that time suggested that some sort of food served in long-term care facilities and nursing homes was the infection source, \"but there was not enough information to identify a specific food.\" The case was reopened in October 2024, when six more cases were reported, and finally in February 2025, the outbreak strain was found in samples from Prairie Farms. The recall was initiated shortly afterward. \u2014Over 150,000 pounds of ground beef recalled nationwide after E. coli contamination \u2014Which came first: Viruses or bacteria? \u2014'Vampire' bacteria thirst for human blood \u2014 and cause deadly infections as they feed Facilities that have purchased the recalled shakes should not serve them, the FDA warns. They should carefully clean and sanitize any surfaces or containers that the products touched and follow FDA's safe handling and cleaning advice to reduce risks of cross-contamination. \"Listeria can survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces,\" the FDA notes. Consumers who have any of the recalled products in their possession should quarantine the items, a public relations representative for Lyons Magnus told Live Science. Those with additional questions can visit the Lyons Magnus website or send an email to frozenshakerecall@lyonsmagnus.com. The lot numbers of the affected products can be found on the FDA website. \"Lyons Magnus' utmost concern is protecting consumers,\" the company's recall states. The company also recalled a number of products in 2022 \u2014 including Organic Valley and Oatly brand beverages \u2014 due to potential contamination with the microbes Cronobacter sakazakii and Clostridium botulinum. At that time, the company received a warning letter from the FDA after the federal agency inspected the Wisconsin facilities where those products had been produced.

        "text": "\"Even the strongest hurricanes in the solar system seem calm in comparison.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works. WASP-121 b is the definition of an \"extreme\" exoplanet \u2014 it's so hot that it rains droplets of liquid iron. Now, astronomers have discovered that this planet, located around 900 light-years away from us, is also ravaged by unexpectedly powerful winds.This represents the first time astronomers have been able to study the atmosphere of a planet outside the solar system in such intricate depth and detail.The WASP-121 b winds, discovered by a team of astronomers using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) located in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, carry elements like iron and titanium around the planet, therefore creating intricate weather patterns. \"This planet\u2019s atmosphere behaves in ways that challenge our understanding of how weather works \u2014 not just on Earth, but on all planets,\" team leader and Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur researcher Julia Victoria Seidel said in a statement. \"It feels like something out of science fiction.\" Many of the extraordinary features of WASP-121 b arise from the fact that it is an ultra-hot Jupiter, a gas giant planet with around 1.2 times the mass of its solar system namesake. WASP-121 b actually orbits so close to its star that a year there lasts just 30 Earth hours.This proximity also means that WASP-121 b is \"tidally locked,\" meaning one side of the world permanently faces its star (its scorching hot dayside) while the other (the nightside) is cooler because it faces out to space in perpetuity. Iron and other metals are vaporized on the scorching hot dayside and are blown across the planet to its nightside, where they condense and fall as liquid metal rains. Related: Surprise discovery in alien planet's atmosphere could upend decades of planet formation theory Delving deep into the atmosphere of WASP-121 b and creating a 3D map of its atmosphere, researchers found different kinds of winds in different layers of the world; they also observed a jet stream spanning half of the planet. As this jet stream gains speed, it appears to violently churn WASP-121 b's atmosphere high up in the sky as it crosses the line between the planet's nightside and dayside, moving toward the hotter half. Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. \"What we found was surprising: a jet stream rotates material around the planet's equator, while a separate flow at lower levels of the atmosphere moves gas from the hot side to the cooler side,\" Seidel said. \"This kind of climate has never been seen before on any planet. \"Even the strongest hurricanes in the solar system seem calm in comparison.\" This complex mapping of WASP-121 b's atmosphere was possible thanks to the VLT instrument ESPRESSO (Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations). The VLT combines light from different telescopes; it analyzes four times as much light as is available to a single instrument, and this allows it to obtain much fainter details of a planet's atmosphere. The team trained ESPRESSO on WASP-121 b for one full passage in front of its star's face, or one full \"transit.\" This let the researchers detect the signature of multiple chemicals in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter across different atmospheric layers. \"The VLT enabled us to probe three different layers of the exoplanet's atmosphere in one fell swoop,\" Leonardo A. dos Santos, team member and a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said in the statement. \u2014'Like a family photo of our solar system': The James Webb telescope is watching 2 alien planets being born before our eyes \u2014Newly discovered super-Earth orbits in and out of its star's habitable zone. Could life survive its extreme climate? \u2014'Supersonic jetstream' with winds 130 times faster than a Category 5 hurricane spotted in the Milky Way The researchers tracked the movement of iron, sodium and hydrogen, using these elements to track winds in the deep, middle and shallow layers of WASP-121 b's atmosphere. \"It's the kind of observation that is very challenging to do with space telescopes, highlighting the importance of ground-based observations of exoplanets,\" dos Santos said. One surprise this investigation delivered was the discovery of titanium lurking just below the jet stream. Previous observations of WASP-121 b have shown this element to be absent. The discrepancy could be because the titanium content was hidden deep in the ultra-hot Jupiter's atmosphere. \"It's truly mind-blowing that we're able to study details like the chemical makeup and weather patterns of a planet at such a vast distance,\" Bibiana Prinoth, a researcher at Lund University researcher and author of a companion paper detailing the titanium discovery, said in the statement.

These new tests provide the ultimate check-up Worse, these drugs only dampen down the body\u2019s general immune response, rather than addressing the causes of autoimmunity, meaning Santamaria had no expectation that taking them would ever cure his condition. As the years passed, Santamaria developed additional autoimmune conditions \u2013 and a determination to learn more about them. \u201cI just wanted to understand the diseases and mechanisms, with the hope I could eventually help others,\u201d he says. He has now made progress towards that goal. Working as an immunologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, Santamaria is at the forefront of a push to develop new therapies to reprogram the immune system and encourage the human body to end its destructive war against its own tissues. As those therapies move into clinical trials, there are promising signs. Indeed, some are so effective that a single dose has, in a few cases, left people symptom-free for years.

        "text": "Advertisement Spending more days in extreme heat seems to be linked to markers of increased biological ageing in people aged 56 and over, suggesting that it could raise the risk of age-related diseases By Carissa Wong 26 February 2025 A woman drinks water during a heatwave in Hyeres, FranceMagali Cohen/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images A woman drinks water during a heatwave in Hyeres, France Magali Cohen/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images Extreme heat seems to speed up biological ageing in older people, suggesting that it could raise the risk of age-related diseases. \u201cThis is one of the first large-scale studies to link long-term heat exposure to biological ageing in humans,\u201d says Eun Young Choi at the University of Southern California. \u201cOlder adults living in areas with more extreme heat days aged biologically faster than those in cooler regions.\u201d Read moreThe radical new theory that wrinkles actually cause ageing Read more The radical new theory that wrinkles actually cause ageing Advertisement Choi and her colleagues analysed genetic data extracted from blood samples collected by other researchers in 2006-7 from 3600 people across the US. All were aged 56 and over at the time. They estimated each participant\u2019s biological age using three so-called epigenetic clocks, which involves looking at patterns of chemical tags called methyl groups on DNA. These patterns alter as we get older and such changes have been linked to age-related diseases. The researchers also examined daily air temperature readings taken within a few kilometres of where participants lived for the six years before blood samples were taken. Get the most essential health and fitness news in your inbox every Saturday. They found that, for roughly every 200 days in that six-year period that participants were exposed to daily maximum temperatures of at least 32.2\u00b0C (90\u2109), their biological age was up to 3.5 months older, on average, than those in cooler areas. That figure varied depending on which clock was used. \u201cThis points to heat exposure increasing the speed of biological ageing,\u201d says Austin Argentieri at Harvard University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Previous studies on people in Taiwan and Germany have also found a link between extreme heat exposure and biological ageing. But epigenetic clocks don\u2019t perfectly capture the ageing process or people\u2019s risk of diseases, says Argentieri. \u201cMore work that can tie together both exposure to extreme heat, biological ageing from these clocks, and the influence on age-related diseases, mortality or lifespan itself, would really help drive home what we should take away from this.\u201d The shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageingA new understanding of our relationship with our \"friendly\" gut microbes shows they actually have a dark side and help cause ageing.

Here's how to fight back What\u2019s more, the study didn\u2019t account for access to air conditioning or how long participants spent outdoors, which would alter their personal exposure to heat, says Argentieri. The team did control for other factors such as age, sex, race, wealth, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, obesity and physical activity. Further studies should explore whether the results translate to younger people, or those living in different countries where people may have different approaches to keeping cool, says Argentieri. Pinpointing who is at most risk of ageing faster due to extreme heat could help policymakers develop and deploy measures to protect them, he says.

        "text": "Advertisement A waste-water surveillance network of strategic international airports could quickly detect outbreaks of new diseases \u2013 and provide early warnings of future pandemics By Jeremy Hsu 12 February 2025 A network of airports like Hong Kong International Airport could effectively detect disease outbreaksYuen Man Cheung / Alamy A network of airports like Hong Kong International Airport could effectively detect disease outbreaks Yuen Man Cheung / Alamy A global early-warning system for disease outbreaks and even future pandemics is possible with minimal monitoring: testing the waste water from a fraction of international flight arrivals at just 20 airports around the world. When passengers fly while infected with bacteria or viruses, they can leave traces of these pathogens in their waste, which airports collect from a plane after the flight lands. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the bathroom on an aircraft, and if you blow your nose and put that in the toilet \u2013 or if you do whatever you have to do \u2013 there\u2019s some chance that some of the genetic material from the pathogen is going into the waste water,\u201d says Guillaume St-Onge at Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Read moreHow worried should we be about a bird flu pandemic? Read more How worried should we be about a bird flu pandemic? Advertisement St-Onge and his colleagues used a simulator called the Global Epidemic and Mobility model to analyse how airport waste-water surveillance networks could detect emerging variants of a virus like the one that causes covid-19. By testing the model using different numbers and locations of airports, they showed that 20 strategically placed \u201csentinel airports\u201d worldwide could detect outbreaks nearly as quickly and efficiently as a network involving thousands of airports. The larger network was just 20 per cent faster but cost much more. To detect emerging threats from anywhere in the world, the network should include major international airports in cities such as London, Paris, Dubai and Singapore. But the team also showed how networks involving a different set of airports could provide more targeted detection of disease outbreaks that were likely to originate in certain continents. \u201cThis modelling study is the first to provide the actual number of sentinel airports required to support effective global surveillance while optimising resource use,\u201d says Jiaying Li at the University of Sydney in Australia. Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox. Airport-based networks could also provide useful information about disease outbreaks early on during an epidemic, including estimates of how quickly the disease can spread from person to person and how many people are likely to be infected from exposure to a single case, says St-Onge. Such waste-water surveillance could provide early warning for known diseases and possibly track new emerging threats too \u2013 if the bacterium\u2019s or virus\u2019s genomic data is available. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to look in the waste water and say: \u2018There is a new pathogen that\u2019s out there,\u2019\u201d says Temi Ibitoye at Brown University in Rhode Island. \u201cBut when a new pathogen is announced, you can very quickly look at that previous waste-water data and say: \u2018Is this present in our sample?\u2019\u201d A map of sentinel airports, with colours indicating how quickly this network would detect a novel disease outbreak originating at various sites around the worldNortheastern University A map of sentinel airports, with colours indicating how quickly this network would detect a novel disease outbreak originating at various sites around the world Northeastern University There are still some nuances to work out, such as how often to take waste-water samples to track different pathogens. Other challenges include figuring out the most efficient ways to sample waste water from aircraft and evaluating the system\u2019s real-world effectiveness, says Li. A long-term monitoring programme would also require cooperation from airlines and airports, along with a consistent source of funding, she says. Individual airports could hesitate to participate because of perceived risk to their operations if infectious disease statistics are made widely available \u2013 unless data-handling agreements could assuage such concerns, says Trevor Charles at the University of Waterloo in Canada. He emphasised the importance of coordinated international funding to offset \u201clocal political considerations\u201d. But even coordination through an international body like the World Health Organization carries its own political complications, given that President Donald Trump has initiated the US\u2019s withdrawal from the organisation, says Ibitoye. Still, research such as this \u201ccontributes towards making [the monitoring network] a reality sooner rather than later\u201d, she says.

We already knew that some people\u2019s well-being and life satisfaction dipped during the early years of the pandemic, but what happened later on, after most restrictions had been lifted, is less well understood. \u201cUnfortunately, most of the studies that were carried out did not continue [in the later years of] the pandemic, so there was a big gap in the research,\u201d says Paola Zaninotto at University College London.

Each participant completed a survey in the two years running up to the pandemic, a second one in the first year of the pandemic in 2020 and a final one between the end of 2021 and early 2023. More than 85 per cent of participants filled in this last survey in 2022, after most infection-control measures in England had ended. The team found that, before the pandemic, the participants rated their sense of purpose in life with an average score of 7.5 out of 10. This dropped to 7.2 in 2020, before rising to 7.6 \u2013 above pre-pandemic levels \u2013 in the final survey. Get the most essential health and fitness news in your inbox every Saturday. Similarly, the participants reported an average life satisfaction score of 7.3 before the pandemic, and although this dipped to 6.9 early in the pandemic, it rose to 7.5 in the final survey.

It may be that the global outbreak reminded people of what is important in life, says Zaninotto. \u201cThe pandemic brought some challenges, but also a more broad appreciation for our lives \u2013 maybe for social connections and other meaningful activities,\u201d she says.

Mountains of research over the past decade demonstrate, time and again, that a decent night\u2019s rest is essential for everything from cognitive function to heart health, mood and more. Not getting good sleep or enough of it is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and hypertension, not to mention the hit to your cognitive function. For many of us, however, getting good sleep is often easier said than done. And much of the advice out there is probably familiar by now, if a little too generic: sleep for 8 hours, avoid bright light and anything stressful before bed, and so on. In reality, life is messier. For a start, we don\u2019t all need the same amount of sleep \u2013 our age, sex, personal habits and tolerances all influence what we individually need. We also all have different lifestyles, including work and travel, which might see us needing to adjust our sleep schedules on a regular basis. Getting good sleep is about more than just clocking up time spent in bed \u2013 but we also aren\u2019t great judges of the quality of the sleep we, a consequence of being unconscious when doing the thing we are trying to assess. Advertisement All of this means that following prescriptive messages about sleeping more can feel frustrating. The good news, as we explore in this special issue devoted to the subject, is that new research is revealing the benefits of a more holistic approach \u2013 some of the most important things you can do to improve your sleep don\u2019t happen in bed, no matter how comfortable that bed might be. Your sleep is affected by what happens during the rest of the day, such as what and when you eat, as well as your gut microbiome and hormonal production. Your personal chronotype \u2013 not only when you prefer to sleep, but also when you\u2019re most active during the day \u2013 plays a role in the quality and quantity of the sleep you get, too. What we need, then, is a 24-hour perspective on sleep. None of this changes how crucial our unconscious hours are, but it does give us fresh opportunities to improve them well before we lay down our heads.

        "title": "New device lets you taste food in virtual reality | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Mack DeGeurin Posted 15 Hours Ago Image: Malte Mueller / Getty Images Virtual reality can, in its own imperfect ways, transport a user into distant experiences. With a headset on, an everyday person can get a brief glimpse of what it\u2019s like to perform a surgery, tour the Louvre, or even make an arrest. One thing VR can\u2019t yet do, however, is simulate the experience of eating lunch. But that could change thanks to a new \u201cbio-integrated gustatory interface\u201d device called \u201ce-Taste.\u201d Researchers from Ohio State University detailed how their new device works this week in the journal Science Advances. They created a small electromagnetic pump connected to a liquid channel of chemicals that, when mixed in the right ratios, can approximate the taste of coffee, lemonade, cake, and other food and drinks. That newly crafted chemical liquid is then pushed through via a gel. Users ultimately experience the taste as a liquid that sits in their mouth. Researchers can then remotely control the gel\u2019s perceived intensity. And while an initial group of human test subjects struggled to accurately differentiate between different taste profiles, the study suggests a future VR steakhouse experience might not be as far-fetched as it sounds. e-Taste is composed of three distinct phases. The first phase uses a set of sensors to analyze a food or beverage and recognize common molecules like glucose and glutamate, which contribute to its unique taste. Various combinations of these chemicals correspond to the five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Once the sample is analyzed, the system encodes the data and transmits it wirelessly to the e-Taste device. Researchers do not need to be in the same room or even the same state to send this flavor data. In fact, the paper details how one researcher based in California submerged a sensor patch in a glass of lemonade and then sent the corresponding \u201cdigital instruction\u201d to a colleague operating the device in Ohio. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The second phase of the process focuses on replicating the initial sample flavor. A small electromagnetic pump contains multiple liquid chambers filled with chemicals that correspond to different taste sensations. These chemicals are combined in a \u201cmixing zone\u201d in proportions dictated by the estimated molecules present in the food or drink it is attempting to imitate. Once the desired flavor profile is achieved, researchers can adjust the timing of the pump\u2019s cycles to increase or decrease the flavor\u2019s overall intensity. The final mixture is then converted into a gel. Water flowing through the gel carries the tastes into the end user\u2019s mouth. (They don\u2019t swallow the chemical concoction). This process allows the user to perceive specific tastes even though no actual food or beverage is involved. Ohio State professor and study co-author Jinhua Li noted that chemical dimensions are still \u201crelatively underrepresented\u201d in virtual and augmented reality. \u201cIt\u2019s a gap that needs to be filled and we\u2019ve developed that with this,\u201d Li said in a statement. The researchers tested their new device on 10 volunteers and received mixed results. On the positive side, the test subjects\u00a0 were able to differentiate between various sour taste profile intensities with approximately 70 percent accuracy. The tests were less conclusive though when researchers asked participants to distinguish between flavors intended to represent cake, fried egg, coffee, and fish soup. That discrepancy is not necessarily due entirely to poor device performance though. Even in the physical world, taste is inherently subjective. Factors such as smell, memory, and visual cues can influence how we perceive food. Two people might experience the taste of the same meal slightly differently. \u201cTaste and smell are greatly related to human emotion and memory,\u201d Li added. \u201cSo our sensor has to learn to capture, control, and store all that information.\u201d Yizhen Jia, a Ohio State University phd student and paper co-first author, told Popular Science the testing process led to some unexpected laboratory moments. Some volunteers were surprised to taste liquid seemingly resembling coffee coming out of a device that looked nothing like a normal coffee maker. Jia himself said he at one point gave himself a higher dose of citric acid in one experiment than expected and quickly realized they needed to dial it back down. Figuring out the right amount of chemicals to add and for what duration was a constant process of trial and error. Interestingly, this is not the first attempt to bring taste sensations to VR. Last year, researchers from City University of Hong Kong developed a handheld, lollipop-like device designed to help people taste certain flavors in virtual reality settings. That device contained chemicals capable of producing nine different flavors. When a voltage was applied to its gel-like surface, the chemicals would travel upward as a liquid and mix with the user\u2019s saliva, creating a facsimile of the intended virtual taste experience. Details about that device were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Bringing taste to VR might be new, but the practice of trying to add in more senses to media dates back nearly a century. In the 1930s, several theaters experimented with releasing fragrance into the air throughout films. A Swiss advertising executive named Hans Laube then patterned a new system dubbed \u201cSmell-O-Vision,\u201d which used a complex system of pipes in a movie theater to release perfumed scent during certain cued points in the performance. More recently, researchers from Japan designed an at home television they dubbed the \u201csmelling screen\u201d that used gel pellets to send out vaporized streams of scent towards viewers. And just last month, Sony teased a future system they are working on where users can walk into a cube-like platform surrounded by LED screens to play iconic PlayStation games like The Last Of Us. In addition to a 360-degree visual experience, Sony said players will also be able to smell aspects of their environment. The e-Taste researchers believe their device could also have applications beyond video games. Theoretically, the technology could one day allow users to virtually taste-test items before ordering them. Medical professionals might also use the device to remotely assess whether patients have lost certain aspects of taste, which could be an early indicator of illness. Additionally, the device could serve as an aid in reintroducing taste sensations to individuals with certain neurological disorders or illnesses, such as long COVID, that have impaired their ability to taste food. \u201cThis concept is here, and it is a good first step toward becoming a small part of the metaverse,\u201d Li said.

        "title": "Patient's tingling feet turns out to be a rat-borne brain parasite | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted 15 Hours Ago A tingling sensation in your feet is usually the result of poor blood circulation. But every so often, it\u2019s an indicator of a much more nightmarish scenario: parasites setting up shop in your brain after previously incubating in rodents, slugs, and snails. This was unfortunately the recent situation for a 30-year-old woman, whose bout of angiostrongyliasis (also known as rat lungworm disease) was recently highlighted in a recent New England Journal of Medicine case study. Rat lungworm disease is caused by the body\u2019s immunoresponse to the parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis. A. cantonensis begins its life cycle after a rat eats an infected snail or slug. Once ingested, the parasite migrates to the rodent\u2019s lungs and lays eggs. After becoming first-stage larvae, A. cantonensis is excreted in the rat\u2019s feces that snails and slugs subsequently eat. The parasite larvae then matures inside the gastropods, allowing the cycle to repeat. But sometimes other animals\u2014and even plants\u2014can get involved, laying the groundwork for human transmission. Species like land crabs and freshwater prawns also snack on the infected slugs and snails, which can increase the parasite\u2019s spread. Meanwhile, larvae are sometimes deposited in gastropod slime as they move across fruits and vegetables. Humans can then become hosts after eating improperly washed leafy vegetables or undercooked crustaceans. Some combination of these reasons is likely how the patient contracted her bout of rat lungworm disease. In this case study, the patient\u2019s symptoms appeared relatively innocuous at first. A few days after returning from a three-week overseas trip that included stops in Japan, Thailand, and Hawaii, the woman began experiencing a mild burning sensation in her feet.The burning soon crept up her legs and was combined with acute fatigue. She originally attributed the issues to jet lag, but the pain eventually increased and she began to get severe headaches. Results from her first emergency room visit only showed a slight increase in white blood cell count, indicating she was fighting off at least some type of infection. With no solution and conditions worsening, the woman visited a different hospital a few days later, this time also with a mild fever. Intravenous anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety medications appeared to finally help her, after which doctors once again discharged her. The woman began packing for another vacation after waking up the next day. However, there was a bit of a problem\u2014she never actually booked a second trip. The patient\u2019s roommate noticed the confusion and encouraged her to go back to bed while informing the woman\u2019s partner of the concerning behavior. A few hours later, she found herself at the hospital yet again. Further blood tests and a CT scan didn\u2019t show any evidence of parasites. Finally, a lumbar puncture to assess her cerebrospinal fluid revealed signs of a rare brain infection caused by parasites known as eosinophilic meningitis. After reviewing her recent travels and ongoing, worsening symptoms, doctors finally believed they could confidently identify the culprit: Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Angiostrongyliasis can be serious if left untreated. In 2010, for example, a 19-year-old Australian man became ill after consuming a live slug on a drunken dare. The patient eventually entered into a nearly 14-month coma that left him paralyzed from the waist down until his death from related complications in 2018. In this recent case, the situation does appear to be much less dire. After six days in the hospital and a two-week drug regimen that included prednisone, albendazole, and other medications, the patient appears symptom-free and in much better health without the unwanted invaders in her body.

        "title": "March skygazing: A \u2018celestial smiley face,' a blood moon, and more | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Tom Hawking Posted 19 Hours Ago While February\u2019s grand planetary parade might be behind us, March will still afford good opportunities to see many of the parade\u2019s participants\u2014especially Mercury. The solar system\u2019s smallest planet will be relatively easy to spot during the first half of the month. There\u2019s also a full lunar eclipse to look forward to, and one of Venus\u2019 periodic transitions from evening star to morning star. Venus, in particular, will be strutting her stuff across the sky in early March. The planet will be blazing brightly enough to be easily visible with the naked eye. By contrast, Mercury\u2019s relatively small size and proximity to the sun typically makes it difficult to identify in the night sky. However, during the first two weeks of March, observers will have two excellent opportunities to see it. During this time, Mercury will be surprisingly bright\u2014the fourth brightest object in the sky.Its brilliance will only fall behind the planets Venus and Jupiter and the star Sirius. The catch is that it sets only 90 minutes after sunset, so you\u2019ll need to dash outside as soon as the sun goes down. While Mercury will be visible throughout early March, there will be two nights that provide especially good opportunities to see it: March 1 and March 7. On March 1, the position of the crescent moon will aid in spotting Mercury, according to Space.com. The easiest way to find Mercury will be to find Venus first\u2014which should be easy, as it\u2019ll be the single brightest object in the sky. Once you\u2019ve found Venus, look down and slightly to the left. Mercury will be hovering just above the horizon\u2014and a little further to the left, roughly between the two planets. The crescent moon will complete a celestial smiley face for the ages. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After March 1, the moon\u2019s trajectory in the sky will take it away from Mercury and Venus, towards another of the brightest objects in the sky: Jupiter. On March 5, the crescent will appear at its closest to Jupiter, making the planetary behemoth of our solar system easy to spot. The ever-essential Farmer\u2019s Almanac advises looking for both moon and planet an hour after sunset, and keeping an eye out for the orange star Aldabaran, which will be just below them. It\u2019s quite a month for the moon: as well as the aforementioned emoji-related hijinks, March brings the only full lunar eclipse of 2025. The event will fully last from 11:57 p.m.on March 13 to 6 a.m. EDT on March 14. Totality will occur between 2:26 and 03:31 a.m. EDT. Full lunar eclipses occur when the moon passes entirely into the Earth\u2019s shadow, and while they\u2019re not as spectacular as full solar eclipses\u2014which involve the Earth passing completely into the moon\u2019s shadow\u2014they\u2019re still events worth seeing! [ Related: How the blood moon gets its ghoulish hue. ] You may also see this event referred to as a \u201cblood moon\u201d, a name derived from the color the moon takes on during the eclipse. While a solar eclipse plunges the Earth into fleeting darkness, this doesn\u2019t happen for the moon: some light is refracted through our atmosphere onto the moon\u2019s surface. The light that reaches the moon is largely toward the low-wavelength, red end of the visible spectrum, because higher-wavelength light tends to be scattered by the atmosphere. Once it\u2019s reassuringly visible again in the night sky, the moon will reach its peak illumination on March 14 at 2:55 a.m. EST. March\u2019s full moon is called the Worm Moon, a name that\u2019s believed to reference the earthworms that begin to emerge from hibernation as spring starts to warm the earth again. Additional Native American names for March\u2019s full moon include the \u201cHard Crust on the Snow Moon\u201d (Anishinaabemowin), the moon of the Strawberry/First Leaves month (Cherokee) and the delightful \u201cThe Day is Cut in Two Moon\u201d (Oneida.) While it might have seemed like the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s winter was never going to end, the season will officially come to a close on March 20, with the vernal\u2013or spring\u2013equinox. This equinox (and its counterpart, the autumnal equinox, which heralds the start of fall) are the two days on which the Northern and Southern Hemispheres receive essentially the same amount of sunlight, because neither is tilted in relation to the sun. [ Related: Why 60 degrees in fall feels different than in the spring. ] Historically, Venus was sometimes called the \u201cmorning star\u201d. However, sharp-eyed readers will have noticed that earlier this month, the planet was decidedly uninterested in the morning, preferring to show herself off in the night sky. This occurs because Venus\u2019s position in the sky actually oscillates between morning and night, depending on how the planet is positioned in relation to both the Earth and the sun. March 22 marks one such transition. Venus will pass briefly between the Earth and the Sun, forming an alignment known as an \u201cinferior conjunction\u201d. By comparison, a \u201csuperior conjunction\u201d happens when Venus aligns with the Earth and the Sun, but is on the other side of the latter. After March 22, Venus will remain in the morning sky for the rest of 2025. Whatever cosmic wonders you plan to spy\u00a0 in March, remember that you\u2019ll have the best results if you get away from the lights of your city or town, and as far as possible from any other sources of light pollution. Once you\u2019re at your destination, set up your telescope (if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one!), or otherwise just find a nice spot to sit and gaze at the sky. Review our stargazing tips, give your eyes half an hour to get used to the darkness, then look aloft and immerse yourself in the beauty of the cosmos. Until next month!

Those days (unfortunately) are behind me, and I need a whole lot more than a keychain bottle opener to get through my day smoothly. These days, power is king since my iPhone doesn\u2019t stay charged up all day like it used to. That\u2019s why I\u2019m obsessed with the GoCable, an\u00a0all-in-one keychain that acts as a charger, bottle opener, and cutter. Another reason why I love it?

It\u2019s come in clutch more than once, saving me from driving home without directions or running errands without my favorite Spotify list playing. Since it\u2019s just six inches long, it takes practically no room in my pocket and tote bag. I can\u00a0finally ditch the annoying 3-foot charging cord I\u2019ve been toting around like a weirdo since I added the\u00a0GoCable\u2019s EDC phone cable to my keychain with the included carabiner clip. It even comes with\u00a0USB-C to USB-C or Lightning ends, meaning I can charge various devices\u2014including my friend\u2019s Android phone (shudder). Another reason why I love this keychain addition: The GoCable\u00a0keychain\u2019s cord supports up to 100W fast charging. I can also see exactly how my trusty iPhone 13 Pro (nope, I\u2019ll never trade it in) is doing while it\u2019s powering up with the integrated LED display. Not only can I give my devices a power boost, but this keychain lets me crack open a crisp Corona without cracking a tooth\u2014or my beer bottle\u2014when I\u2019ve forgotten my usual bottle opener. Plus, the safe-proofed cutter makes for yet another handy addition, letting me tear through my Amazon packages easily the minute they arrive at my door.

        "title": "Narwhals spotted using tusks for non-mating fun | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted Yesterday With their long, spiral tusks, narwhals (Monodon monoceros) look like something out of a fairy tale. Primarily seen in male narwhals, these single elongated teeth that can grow up to 10 feet. These gregarious whales typically travel in pods of two to 10 individuals, but are a bit elusive and difficult to study in the wild. Scientists believe that the tusks are primarily used in competition for mates, but that might not be the whole story. New drone evidence detailed in a study published February 28 in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science found that narwhals can use their tusks to forage, explore their surroundings, and even play. \u201cNarwhals are known for their \u2018tusking\u2019 behavior, where two or more of them simultaneously raise their tusks almost vertically out of the water, crossing them in what may be a ritualistic behavior to assess a potential opponent\u2019s qualities or to display those qualities to potential mates,\u201d Greg O\u2019Corry-Crowe, a study co-author and biologist specializing in marine mammals at FAU Harbor Branch and a National Geographic Explorer, said in a statement. \u201cBut now we know that narwhal tusks have other uses, some quite unexpected, including foraging, exploration and play.\u201d Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Equipped with drones, an international team of researchers in the Arctic spotted the first evidence of narwhales using their tusks to investigate, manipulate, and influence the behavior of a fish called Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). They use their tusks to hit the fish with such force that the fish are subsequently stunned\u2013and possibly killed. In total, the team representing scientists from Florida Atlantic University\u2019s (FAU) Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Canada\u2019s Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and Inuit communities in Nunavut in Canada\u2019s High Arctic captured 17 distinct behaviors in the narwhals. These actions shed some light on the dynamics between these photogenic Arctic mammals and the fish and birds that live alongside them.One of these dynamics came in the form of a kleptoparasitism\u2013or \u201cfood thief\u201d situation\u2013between a narwhal, fish, and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus). Additionally, they saw the first evidence of likely play in narwhals. They observed a type of play called exploratory-object play. During this type of play, animals handle an object as a way to learn. Human babies stacking blocks together and how dogs and cats play with toys are examples of exploratory-object play. They also show evidence of social learning, social instruction, and personality differences among individual narwhals. \u201cI have been studying narwhal for over a decade and have always marveled at their tusks,\u201d study co-author and Fisheries and Oceans, Canada research scientist Cortney Watt said in a statement. \u201cTo observe them using their tusks for foraging and play is remarkable. This unique study where we set up a remote field camp and spent time filming narwhal with drones is yielding many interesting insights and is providing a bird\u2019s eye view of their behavior that we have never seen before.\u201d According to the team, the narwhals showed remarkable dexterity, precision, and speed of movement of the tusk. They also regularly made adjustments to track a moving target. The tip of the tusk was used to interrogated and manipulate the target in short bursts. The fish typically responded to these brushes with the narwhal tusk. [ Related: Narwhal tusks are full of illuminating secrets. ] \u201cOur observations provide clear evidence of narwhals chasing fish and using their tusks to interact directly with the fish and to influence the fish\u2019s behavior,\u201d said O\u2019Corry-Crowe. \u201cSome of the interactions we saw appeared competitive in nature with one whale blocking or trying to block another whale\u2019s access to the same target fish, while others may have been more subtle, possibly communicative and even affiliative. None appeared overtly aggressive.\u201d Some of the social behaviors among the whales\u2013including learning from one another\u2013also suggests that these social processes might speed up the behavioral adaptation in response to changes in the Arctic.\u00a0 Some parts of the Arctic are warming three times faster than the rest of the planet, depending on the region and time of year. \u201cTo understand how narwhals are being affected by and adapting to the changing Arctic, field studies using innovative, non-invasive tools like drones are essential to observe them in their natural environment without disturbing them,\u201d said O\u2019Corry-Crowe. \u201cDrones provide a unique, real-time view of their behavior, helping scientists gather crucial data on how narwhals are responding to shifts in ice patterns, prey availability and other environmental changes. Such studies are key to understanding the impact of global warming on these elusive animals.\u201d Laura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she is particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology, nanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.

        "title": "'Poop pills' tested in pancreatic cancer patients | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted Yesterday A research team at Canada\u2019s Lawson Research Institute of St. Joseph\u2019s Health Care London and the London Health Sciences Center Research Institute (LHSCRI) is readying a two-year Phase I safety trial in which a small group of cancer patients will receive fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)\u2014aka \u201cpoop pills.\u201d Although the less-than-appetizing supplements are still in their early stages of development, the innovative approach has already shown promise in boosting recovery chances for other forms of cancer like melanoma. Pancreatic cancer remains difficult to treat, and is responsible for around 8 percent of all cancer deaths.It also has one of the lower longterm survival rates with only about 13 percent of patients surviving more than five years. Part of this is due to the ecosystems surrounding cancerous tumors, which possess their own microbial communities that include fungi, viruses, and bacteria. These systems can make certain cancers more resistant to chemotherapy regimens. In recent years, researchers began wondering if altering these microbial populations could make tumors more receptive to existing treatment options. Fecal transplants as a medical tool aren\u2019t new. In fact, increasing evidence suggests poop-based medications may improve people\u2019s resilence against superbugs and other dangerous health problems. Since the FDA\u2019s approval of the first fecal transplant pills in 2023, many experts are hopeful that adapting it and similar innovations could help treat particularly resistant cancers. Fecal microbiota transplantation isn\u2019t nearly as gross as it sounds. First, stool samples are collected from prescreened health donors before being processed in a lab. During the standard procedure, the stool is filtered for its helpful bacterial contents while the remaining material is discarded. The resulting odorless and tasteless solution is packed into LND101 capsules, The pancreatic cancer patients will take the pills on a specific dosage calendar. From there, experts will study how the gut biomes of trial volunteers change over time, and how that may affect their overall immune systems while battling cancer. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

According to trial collaborator Seema Nair Parvathy, earlier studies indicate fecal microbiota transplantation has helped improve outcomes for patients with advanced lung, renal cell, and skin cancers. But the team stressed their clinical studies are only possible through the help of poop donors. As they enter trials, researchers are seeking volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50 who haven\u2019t taken antibiotics in at least six months, are not immunocompromised, and do not have chronic gastrointestinal disorders.

        "title": "Six weeks, three moon landers: The era of private space exploration is here | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Mack DeGeurin Posted Yesterday Image: Fausta/Getty Images Moon exploration is undergoing a potentially transformative moment. Over the course of six weeks, three different lunar landers began a rocket-fueled space journey to learn more about Earth\u2019s nearest neighbor. All three landers are operated by private, and relatively newly-formed companies. That\u2019s a marked shift away from space exploration of the 20th century, which was dominated by state-backed, public institutions like NASA. If they complete their missions, these space upstarts could help pave the way for future planned human moon missions, and possibly, even a not-too distant lunar economy. As of this writing, the three lunar landers are either currently in the moon\u2019s orbit or hurtling their way toward it. The first two landers\u2014one operated by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace and another by a Japanese firm called ispace,\u2014launched as a pair on January 15, hitching a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket. The other, a spacecraft dubbed \u201cAthena\u201d by Intuitive Machines, blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday evening. The video clip below shows the moment Athena dislodged from the SpaceX rocket carrying it out of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Deployment of @Int_Machines IM-2 confirmed pic.twitter.com/67DVvpoZSS Intuitive Machines made history last year by becoming the first private company to successfully land one of its lunar landers on the moon\u2019s surface. The word \u201csuccess,\u201d however, might be a bit generous. An issue during the landing caused the spacecraft to tip over and land on its side. Here\u2019s what each of these three privately funded landers could accomplish during their respective visits to the moon. Intuitive Machines\u2019 4.73-meter-tall (15.3 ft) tall Nova-C lander \u201cAthena\u201d is currently on path to the moon following a successful launch this week. The vehicle is expected to touchdown on March 6 on a plateau near the moon\u2019s south pole. That is, of course, assuming all goes according to plan. Once landed, Athena will have a busy schedule. The lander\u2019s primary objective will be to collect samples in an area scientists believe could be stocked with water ice. Athena comes equipped with a drill that it will use to tap down into the ground 10 centimeters at a time until it reaches its target depth of 3.3 feet. In total, the lander is expected to spend 10 days on the moon\u2019s surface. Lighting the way to the Moon: As @Int_Machines\u2019 lander lifts off aboard a @SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, it takes with it NASA science and tech. Its mission? To help us better understand the lunar environment in preparation for future human explorers. pic.twitter.com/KIx5vnpHRC But Athena won\u2019t be alone on its journey. Stored inside the lander is another smaller \u201cMicro Nova Hopper\u201d propulsive drone, named after U.S. computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper. The Hopper drone will propel itself up and away from Athena and ultimately land in a deep, rugged crater shrouded in darkness. Like the lander, the Hopper plans to search for signs of water ice. Athena will also deploy a small, four-wheeled rover developed by Lunar Outpost, which will test a first-of-its-kind lunar cellular network from Nokia. (The network is, for now, intended to relay images, videos, and commands between the rover, Hopper, and Athena). And if that weren\u2019t enough, the Lunar Outpost rover will also deploy an even smaller, matchbox-sized robot called the AstroAnt to take temperature and other environmental measurements. The entire project is like a Russian nesting doll of highly advanced aerospace tech. Intuitive Machines did not immediately respond to Popular Science\u2019s request for comment. Athena, despite launching more than a month later, is actually expected to land on the moon just a few days after Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander. That model, one of the two that launched in January, entered the moon\u2019s orbit on February 12 and is gearing up for a March 2 touchdown on the eastern edge of the moon\u2019s near east side. As part of the public-private partnership Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), Blue Ghost will serve as the vehicle to transport 10 NASA science and tech instruments. Once landed, the lander will operate for roughly two weeks, collecting data about the lunar subsurface, which is made up of dust, loose rocks, and mineral fragments. That feeling you get when you look out the window and realize you\u2019re almost home! T-4 days until we land in the Moon. Blue Ghost will reach her final destination no earlier than 2:34 am CST on March 2. We\u2019ll start the joint livestream with @NASA at 1:20 am CST, approximately 75\u2026 pic.twitter.com/t5TN85zpmM Blue Ghost has already made significant contributions even without landing. Earlier this week, Firefly Aerospace released a series of video and photos taken by the lander in orbit that shows a close up view of the moon\u2019s farside. The images, taken around 74 miles above the lunar surface, are some of the best examples yet of an area of the moon not visible from Earth. In one of the videos (seen below), the faint silhouette of Earth can be seen in the distance. Earth rise, Earth set, repeat! Blue Ghost's third and final lunar orbit maneuver is complete!

The incredible @NASA science data Blue Ghost has captured, from record-breaking GNSS signals to magnetic field measurements, is already unlocking insights for the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/McR4DtWPGX The third lunar lander, launched at the same time as Blue Ghost, is operated by a Tokyo-based company called ispace. More than the other two companies on this list, ispace is looking for redemption. The company tried to send a lander to the moon in 2023 but a possible software issue caused it to malfunction and plummet three miles before crash landing on the moon\u2019s surface. Their new lander, called \u201cResilience,\u201d is on route to the moon and is expected to arrive sometime in May or early June. If Resilience can stick the landing, the plan is to deploy an 11-pound rover that will collect and analyze dirt samples. The lander will also carry various scientific instruments, including a water electrolyzer equipment and deep space radiation probe. Resilience will also send up a small model house designed by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg that\u2019s expected to sit mounted on the rover while it works. \u201cI feel very confident about the [Resilience] lander, which has steadily achieved milestones and is on track for success,\u201d ispace Founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada said in a recent statement. \u201cI look forward to watching the ongoing journey of [Resilience], navigating a low-energy orbit through deep space taking it as far as 1.1 million kilometers from Earth, before heading to the moon.\u201d The lunar lander achievements over the past month are the culmination of decades-long efforts to transition a greater chunk of space travel away from large, centralized government organizations and towards a more competitive private market. Household name rocket companies like SpaceX and Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin have been the most obvious beneficiaries of this pivot, but so have various startups and firms specializing in everything from shorter-range spaceplanes and satellites to luxury spacesuits. Partnerships with some of these privately funded firms has also allowed public organizations like NASA to send equipment up to space faster and at lower costs than if they were to manage every aspect of a mission. But the shift toward privatization has some potential downsides as well. Critics warn that the profit motives inherent in these new companies could lead them to prioritize more immediate, money-making ventures like tourism or industrial mining over scientific exploration, which can be harder to quantify in financial terms. Other long-term projects with less clear returns on investment, like deep space probes, might also get short shrift. There are also concerns that for-profit business models seeking to maximize value as quickly as possible could end up prioritizing speed over the safety of equipment\u2014or even future human crews. Regardless, recent events could mark the first chapter in a new era of space commercialization. Some startups, like Interlune and Karman+, have plans to one day mine the lunar surface for valuable minerals and send autonomous mining drones to far-off asteroids. Multiple companies have already proven that a market\u2014albeit a niche one\u2014even exists for sending billionaires on brief space vacations. Others, like Blue Origin, have envisioned a future where astronauts live and work in space. It\u2019s important to emphasize that all of these proposals are likely several decades away\u2014if they happen at all. Still, any success in these areas will likely build on the foundation laid by the private lunar lander launches of the past month.

        "title": "Should the International Space Station be dirtier? | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Lauren Leffer Posted Yesterday Far away from Earth, there\u2019s an entire intriguing world of microbes to explore. Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), quasi-extraterrestrial life is growing and replicating. Viruses, bacteria, and fungi carried on the bodies of astronauts, building materials, and food all make their way to the ISS despite best efforts to avoid contamination. Once aboard, certain microbes thrive, but a new study suggests it might not be the most ideal mix.The space station\u2019s microbiome represents an artificial extreme. It\u00a0lacks diversity and contains a disproportionate amount of antimicrobial resistance genes, according to research published February 27 in the journal Cell. At the same time, the ISS is full of unique and mysterious chemical compounds. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Together, the research team suggests these two factors may be contributing to the ailments and immune dysfunction many astronauts experience on the job. Skin rashes, sudden allergies, hypersensitivity, and re-emerging latent viruses like the kind that cause mononucleosis and herpes are common among space crews. A better understanding of the microbial and chemical conditions of space infrastructure could help engineers and scientists make improvements, and keep space-faring humans healthier in the future. \u201cWhat are astronauts exposed to? That was really the question being asked,\u201d Pieter Dorrestein, a co-senior study author, chemist and microbiologist at the University of California San Diego, tells Popular Science. \u201cThis is particularly important as we\u2019re starting to think about long-term space travel, or maybe even inhabiting other planets,\u201d he says. To explore the question, Dorrestein and his collaborators analyzed 737 surface swabs collected by astronauts from the United States Orbital Segment of the ISS, cataloging the microbes and chemicals collected in each sample. They then compared that dataset with control samples and prior data taken from different environments on Earth. They noted many interesting finds and patterns, but above all, they found a dearth. There\u2019s what astronauts are exposed to, and then what they aren\u2019t. \u201cOne way to describe the ISS environment is an extreme absence of molecules and microbes,\u201d Dorrestein says. That\u2019s not to say the entire ISS was uniform. The team found that , despite a shared air system and the close quarters, different modules within the space station had notably different microbial and molecular profiles. An area\u2019s function was the biggest determiner of the germ and chemical cocktail lingering on surfaces. For example, the h module used for cooking and dining was host to more food-derived microbes. The module that houses the waste and hygiene compartment contained more germs associated with human feces and chemical signatures of urine. But overall, the scientists documented low microbial diversity across surfaces in the United States Orbital Segment, compared with samples from Earth. The microbes found aboard the ISS encompassed only about 6 percent of the major clades on the bacterial phylogenetic tree. By comparison, homes on Earth host between 10 and 15 percent of these clades and outdoor environments nearly 30. Positioned along the spectrum of known microbiomes, the space station most closely resembles that of a COVID-19 isolation dorm or a highly sanitized hospital. [ Related: Six months in space is not that bad for your brain. ] As you might expect, the kinds of microbes present in natural settings were largely missing. Instead, most of the bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms were those associated with the human body. The most prevalent bacterial genus was staphylococcus, which generally lives on human skin and in our mucus membranes. The notable gaps in the space microbiome could be cause for concern, according to the study. It\u2019s well known that exposure to a wide array of microorganisms plays a role in immune system health. People who grow up in relatively aseptic city apartments are more likely to develop asthma and allergies than those who spend their childhoods on farms, for instance. It\u2019s possible that going without key microbial exposure for months at a time might trigger astronauts\u2019 immune systems to malfunction. Among the microbes that were found, the scientists identified more than 1,000 genes for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) circulating in more than 90 percent of the samples. \u201cIt is a lot. It is an increase over terrestrial environments,\u201d Dorrestein says. AMR genes, alone, aren\u2019t necessarily a problem. However, if they\u2019re acquired by a human pathogen, it could spell serious illness for space travelers. The space station\u2019s\u00a0 chemical profile proved a little more difficult to pin down. The researchers found hundreds of molecules in their chemical samples, but could only identify a small fraction. For 65 percent, the researchers were unable to even trace likely sources, let alone determine structure. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to understand space travel, we need to be able to [better understand] these molecules,\u201d says Dorrestein. Of the identified compounds, most were from bacterial sources (the products of standard germ metabolism). Others came from food, personal care products, cleaning supplies, or building materials. Notably, the scientists found industrial chemicals like PFAS and phthalates which are known to have negative human health effects. Despite the difficulty in identifying most of the chemicals, what could be distinguished echoed the molecular conditions of a highly urbanized, synthetic environment. \u201cThese findings further position the ISS as an extreme, human-input-dominated built environment,\u201d the authors wrote in the study.While the presence of certain chemicals is cause for concern, Dorrestein notes that the lack of certain other compounds could pose its own risk. Though less studied than microbiomes, molecular diversity may also confer health benefits. For example, certain dietary compounds are known to interact with gut bacteria to offer an immune boost, he explains. More research would be needed to understand how the specific chemical context of the ISS is impacting astronauts. However, one chemical finding stands out. In Node 3, the zone astronauts use for exercise and bathroom purposes, the chemical profile included a strong signal of cleaning products and disinfectants. At the same time, this node had the most diverse microbial environment\u2013 signaling a potential relationship between constant cleaning and microbe growth. Dorrestein notes the causality is unclear. It could be that there\u2019s more germs, and so the area is cleaned more frequently. Or, it might be that frequent cleaning fosters an environment where no single bug can take over. Though diverse microbiomes are good in many contexts, that might not be the case here, where many of the microbes seem to be evolving and passing around genes for antimicrobial resistance. Frequent disinfection could be upping the likelihood of hard-to-treat pathogens emerging. Thankfully, the study offers one potential way forward: Add some dirt. \u201cIntroducing an environmental non-saline soil matrix could potentially alter the microbial composition of industrialized built environments, including the ISS, to align more closely with the microbial communities found in environmentally exposed habitats,\u201d write the researchers. [ Related: There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the International Space Station\u2019s ocean grave.] That\u2019s a very roundabout, technical way of saying that (thoughtfully) bringing some literal Earth to space might make the conditions healthier for humans,\u00a0 Dorrestein explains.He doesn\u2019t envision laying down shovel-fulls of compost on the ISS floor, but perhaps sterilized, then carefully re-inoculated soil could be used to grow plants and spread beneficial microbes\u00a0 for the astronauts\u2019 benefit. Fermented foods like natto and kombucha might help too, he suggests. And alternate, less harsh and more probiotic cleaning methods may be another tool. Yet, to truly determine the best ways to boost space immunity, maximize astronaut health, and enable planetary exploration, more research is needed. The scientists view this work as a starting point. \u201cOur study really creates a resource to continuously learn from. There\u2019s a lot of signals we detect that we don\u2019t yet know how to interpret,\u201d Dorrestein says. \u201cWe still have a lot to learn about the microbes and chemicals in space travel.

        "title": "Mount Vesuvius eruption turned a victim\u2019s brain into glass | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted Yesterday The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE presented its surrounding ancient Roman communities with a number of terrifying ways to die: falling debris, collapsing buildings, asphyxiation from superheated dust plumes, etc.. And while attention is often focused on the destruction of Pompeii and its thousands of victims, the fate of nearby Herculaneum wasn\u2019t much better. According to recent analysis of unique samples recovered from the seaside archeological site, the Vesuvius eruption even caused one person\u2019s brain to flash-fry into a rare form of organic glass. The theory, laid out in a study published February 27 in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on examinations of tiny shards found in 2020 inside the skull and spinal column of an individual at Herculaneum\u2013a small port town with a population of around 5,000 people at the time. The victim is believed to have been a roughly 20-year-old man who worked as a guard at the Collegium Augustalium, a public building dedicated to worshipping Emperor Augustus. At the time of his death, however, the guard was laying in his bed\u2014and it was this environment that likely fostered the extremely specific conditions needed for brain and spinal fluid vitrification. While glass is a foundational component in many industries today,\u00a0 it only naturally occurs in rare circumstances. This is because glass is only created when its liquid state cools fast enough to prevent crystallization as it solidifies. In order to accomplish this, there must be a major temperature difference between the substance itself and its environment. Not only that, but the liquid material must also solidify at a much higher temperature than its surroundings. Because most organic matter is largely water, conditions rarely allow for natural glass formation given its freezing point.\u201cIt would therefore be impossible to find organic glass embedded in volcanic deposits that have reached several hundred of Celsius degrees,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors. Using X-ray analysis and electron microscopy, the team confirmed the guard\u2019s brain could only have turned to glass if it was heated \u201cwell above\u201d 950 degrees Fahrenheit (510 degrees Celsius) before quickly cooling. But the majority of the eruption\u2019s known after-effects cannot account for brain and spinal fluid vitrification. The eruption\u2019s pyroclastic flows, for example, did not exceed 869\u2109 (465 \u2103) and cooled far too slowly to create the glass. The study authors therefore concluded that \u201cthe body was exposed to the passage and vanishing of a short-lived, dilute and much hotter pyroclastic flow\u201d that offered an early, quick flash-heating before subsequent rapid cooling. \u201cThe glass that formed as a result of such a unique process attained a perfect state of preservation of the brain and its microstructures,\u201d they wrote, adding that it is now the \u201conly such occurrence\u201d known on Earth.\u00a0 And according to Guido Giordano, the study\u2019s lead author at Italy\u2019s Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre, it\u2019s unlikely they will find another example anytime soon. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. \u201cIn principle it is possible. There is more to be excavated below the modern city that may have preserved a similar occurrence,\u201d Giordano tells Popular Science. \u201cHowever conditions must have been very, very specific because the organic tissue must have experienced a heating fast enough not to entirely destroy it (which is instead the most common occurrence) and then fast-cool to turn into glass.\u201dGiordano believes the building and room in which the guard died offered just the right conditions. But if additional brain glass is to be found, it will be in the ruins of Herculaneum and not Pompeii. \u201cSuch [a] hot ash cloud hit Herculaneum during the night when Pompeii was still under the fallout of pumice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe early pyroclastic flows arrived and buried Pompeii the day after, but at lower temperatures.\u201d Andrew Paul is Popular Science\u2019s staff writer covering tech news.

        "title": "Why can some people wiggle their ears? | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Clarissa Brincat Posted Yesterday About one in five people can wiggle their ears\u2014while the rest watch in non-wiggly envy. But what makes this skill possible for some and impossible for others? Ear movement is controlled by the auricular muscles\u2014three muscles that connect the outer ear (or \u2018auricle\u2019) to the skull and scalp. Each muscle is responsible for a different movement: the anterior auricular muscle pulls the ear forward, the superior auricular muscle lifts it slightly, and the posterior auricular muscle pulls it backward. Together, these movements create what we recognize as ear wiggling. While everyone has auricular muscles, only a small number of people can consciously flex these muscles to wiggle their ears. But why? The ability to wiggle your ears may seem like a hereditary trait, but it\u2019s not that simple. A 1949 study found that while most ear wigglers had at least one parent who could do the same, five out of 24 cases showed that both parents lacked the trait. This suggests that ear wiggling doesn\u2019t follow the regular dominant inheritance pattern seen in traits like tongue rolling, freckles, or brown eyes. If it were truly dominant, we\u2019d expect it to be much more common. So, if genetics isn\u2019t the full answer, what\u2019s behind this intriguing ability? Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It comes down to the way our brains are wired. Some of the brain\u2019s neural pathways are naturally under conscious control, while others aren\u2019t. We know that auricular muscles are controlled by the facial nerve. But in most people, the neural pathway governing ear wiggling is not under conscious control, making the action impossible. A small 1995 study of 204 men and 238 women suggests that gender may influence ear wiggling ability. In the study, approximately 22% of participants were able to move one ear, while about 18% could move both ears simultaneously. Significantly more men than women were able to move both ears at the same time. To date, no further research has been conducted on this topic. You might be wondering if the ability to wiggle your ears offers any special advantage. For animals like dogs, cats, and monkeys, ear movement helps track sounds, which is crucial for detecting predators or prey. But over millions of years, humans evolved to rely less on hearing for survival. As a result, the auricular muscles became weaker and are now considered a vestigial feature\u2014an evolutionary leftover that\u2019s no longer necessary but hasn\u2019t completely disappeared. Despite its seemingly trivial nature, ear wiggling could offer real benefits. Neuroscientist Jerome Maller from Monash University in Australia believes that ear wiggling could be used to improve recovery after stroke or traumatic brain injuries. This ties into the concept of neuroplasticity\u2014the brain\u2019s ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning, experience, or following injury. Because ear wiggling involves a deep level of thought, it can promote neuroplasticity more effectively than simple, repetitive movements, Maller wrote in a paper published in the journal Medical Hypotheses. So practicing ear wiggling may help repair or regrow damaged brain pathways. Although the mechanism behind ear wiggling is complex, \u201cit is possible for potentially anyone to learn how to wiggle their ears because the necessary muscles and nerves are already in place,\u201d Maller wrote. \u201cThere are many anecdotal reports of people being able to teach themselves the skill by practicing in a mirror.\u201d Right now, Maller\u2019s theory remains a hypothesis. But if proven true, ear wiggling could become a novel tool in rehabilitation for those recovering from brain injuries. Maybe, ear wiggling is more than just a quirky party trick.

When we think about the best telescopes for beginners, we first and foremost think about approachable builds that have a lot of built-in stability for a good viewing experience. Then, there are certain kinds of beginners looking for telescopes that must be considered. For example, the parent wanting to share the universe with their child, the photographer who is tired of the terrestrial, and so on. As we prepared the best telescopes for beginners, we considered all these types of people. The following telescopes were chosen for being good telescopes for the amateur and for their consistent quality. This means that you\u2019ll see telescopes made for scanning the stars yourself, for being assisted by advanced tech, and even kid-friendly telescopes. You should also expect to see a lot of Celestron-branded telescopes; their products have been a favorite of ours for quite some time and are well-known for their quality builds and smart tech. (And they won\u2019t cost as much as, say, a Unistellar Odyssey Pro, which is amazing and highly automated, but at $3,999, it is far from what you\u2019d consider a good beginner pick.) Celestron Why it made the cut: This telescope allows you to work with your phone to find the most interesting sights of the night. Specs When you look up at the sky at night, you can see between dozens and hundreds of bright lights, which is the way our brain and eyes pair up to render the stars, planets, and other features of the night sky. You\u2019d think zooming in on them would be easy, but it isn\u2019t. Celestron\u2019s StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ teams up with your smartphone to guide you not only toward the stars and planets but also to specific stars and planets. Using your phone, you can choose a target or pick from selected astral bodies that are visible from your location on the given night you\u2019re stargazing. Then, place the phone in the Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ\u2019s holder. On-screen arrows will guide you in your targeting process; no complex astronomy terms or knowledge of constellations are required. In essence, this telescope acts like Google Maps driving directions for the stars. What might be intimidating about this telescope to the beginner is its large size. If you\u2019re not using it regularly, it\u2019s a lot of scope to haul around or host in your home. Nearly all of the other telescopes on this list are going to be smaller, so if space (in a very local sense of the word) is an issue for you, there may be better options on this list. Koolpte Why it made the cut: This Koolpte telescope allows phone mounting and remote picture-taking for stable shots. Specs The Koolpte 90900mm is made with picture-taking in mind, but we also think that you\u2019ll get the best value out of this scope as it is designed to ease you into more advanced shots from a solid beginning. The scope comes with a variety of lenses and eyepieces, ultimately giving you the ability to get a large magnification level (an advanced user\u2019s dream) when you\u2019re ready for it. While you shouldn\u2019t expect a photo to rival these James Webb telescope images, you can certainly get a shot worthy of your personal collection on it due to the ability to take photos via a remote button press\u2014you won\u2019t accidentally jiggle the telescope lens light years off track when you tap the \u2018take photo\u2019 button. Advanced fine-tuning features that let you alter the Koolpte 90900mm\u2019s aim by a single degree at a time will also allow you to frame a shot exactly as you wish. Celestron Why it made the cut: This telescope is made with young users in mind, making it easy for them (and their parents) to hop in quickly. Specs While telescopes for kids might seem simple and ready for beginners by design, some are better than others in this regard. The Celestron FirstScope series of scopes is definitely that way. They require essentially no setup, have a sturdy base as opposed to a typical tripod design (though this makes them shorter, and you might need to sit to use it), and let you get right to the fun. Coincidentally, this is also great for adults, too, and as a result this is the best telescope for beginners to share with their eager kids. A telescope typically isn\u2019t something you\u2019d consider sending with your child to a friend\u2019s house. However, the National Park FirstScope from Celestron weighs under 5 pounds, is only 13 inches at its widest, and costs under $100. That makes for easy movability and lowered fear about damaging a priceless object while out and about. Still, younger children should have some parental guidance, especially when it comes to what time to use the scope and safe usage of it. Celestron Why it made the cut: The Celestron NexStar 8SE finds things in the sky for you. Specs Celestron\u2019s NexStar 8SE uses smart technology to find out where you are, what\u2019s available to see, and position itself accordingly. You line up any three bright objects in the sky, let the telescope do its calculations, and then simply use the motor control to select what you want to look at. Then, the motors of the telescope move into position for you. In many ways, this is largely a skill-free high-powered telescope. If you travel or vacation often and want to see what you can see with less light pollution or the rapidly growing skyglow, you\u2019ll be delighted to know that the telescope breaks down into seven component parts, making for compact traveling. While discussing components, know that the included StarSense AutoAlign and Wi-Fi modules that are included in this kit are compatible with other Celestron packages and that you can attach a DSLR camera to its base for a unique picture-taking opportunity. Admittedly, this telescope is on the expensive side at $1,599. It\u2019s ideal if you\u2019re looking to jump into the deep end quickly and have no patience for fiddling around, however. Celestron Why it made the cut: This budget telescope has everything you need to really get started. Specs When we look at budget telescopes, the classic design and build of the Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ make it a quick favorite. It will look and feel like what you\u2019re thinking of when you think of a simple telescope, making it feel \u201cfamiliar\u201d right away, even if you don\u2019t have much or any experience with telescopes. This is a do-it-by-hand sort of machine and all of the smarts are going to have to come from you. But, with its affordable price and simple mechanisms, you\u2019re likely to be very happy with it. It\u2019s a lightweight machine and doesn\u2019t have pro-tier fine-tuning, which can make it somewhat fidgety when you\u2019re aiming for precision focus, but getting a good peek in is highly possible. Overall, this is a great starter telescope. Where do you even begin when looking for a telescope that will treat beginners right? If your first instinct is to think of the magnification, you aren\u2019t alone, but that isn\u2019t the only factor and (as you\u2019ll see) can be misleading when looking for a telescope that you can easily use right out of the box. Here are the most common things to think about from a beginner\u2019s perspective when buying your first telescope, as well as the generally accepted recommendations for what to get. Magnification is one of the hardest aspects of telescope usage for beginners to wrap their minds around. As one beginner has thoughtfully posted online, most beginners want max magnification. The problem? It isn\u2019t always useful, can increase blurriness if all other parts of the telescope aren\u2019t up to par, and makes stability (which can already be difficult for the beginner to manage) even more important than it already is. Instead, a magnification between 50X and 200X is probably more manageable for the beginner. To keep things simple, the above telescopes were chosen for their complete package so the beginner can expect to have a good shot right away. While magnification is important, and beginners care about it enough to make it worthy of mention, it isn\u2019t necessarily the defining trait of the best telescopes for beginners that you might think it is. There are many types of telescopes out there, often with naming conventions that invoke history textbooks and historical figures like Newton and Dobson. While it is important to figure out what sort of telescope you want, it is equally important not to get overwhelmed with a preliminary choice. Here\u2019s a primer on the telescope optical design types: Reflector: These telescopes use mirrors to reflect light into focus and are, therefore, shorter and often cheaper to make. When we looked at telescopes under $500, we interviewed Dr. Jason Aufdenberg, Associate Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, who suggested that Dobsonian reflectors are the best telescopes for beginners due to their high light collection. Refractor: These telescopes are longer and thinner, using lenses to peer straight at a target. They provide high stability but are typically somewhat expensive. Catadioptric: These telescopes use mirrors and lenses together to create a compact, portable telescope. While more complex telescopes will have similarly more complex mounting types, as a beginner, the best telescopes for you will likely not be too complex in this regard. In most instances, you\u2019ll get a telescope that fits on a standard tripod, which will almost certainly come with your scope. Based on your needs or desires, you may wish to ask yourself some of the following questions to determine if a given telescope for beginners truly fits your needs: Ultimately, the most important thing for your telescope mount will be the stability it provides. A wiggly, jiggly telescope is almost never going to be the best telescope for a beginner to dig into the hobby with. And a handheld telescope would likely be a disaster. Much like a distracted driver reading a text and migrating into another lane due to a small deviation in the car\u2019s direction, even small movements will provide completely different viewpoints in the distance from Earth to our moon and beyond. As a result, look for mid-bars (aka \u201cspreaders\u201d) that increase the strength of a tripod\u2019s legs by connecting them in the midpoint between the feet and the mounting area. Additionally, heavier telescopes might be better for you as a beginner, even if the idea of a heavy telescope might initially feel intimidating\u2014the extra weight will hold the telescope more firmly to the ground, increasing stability naturally. Finally, some telescopes have motorized controls, which make for smooth transitions and can even be programmed to target specific celestial bodies. This makes it easy for people, even beginners, to find what they want. As previously alluded to, we\u2019ve collected tons of telescopes under $500, so highly affordable telescopes are available. And, if you just want to explore the hobby, see a few sights, and possibly just have a conversation piece in your room that you pull out from time to time, this is a great place to start. But, like many hobbies, there are affordable places to start that can let you try out decent equipment so you can jump in with a more expensive (but still appropriate for beginners) product once you\u2019ve gained your footing. We highly recommend looking in your area for one of the many library telescope programs that are popping up nationwide to give you extra perspective while in this beginner\u2019s stage. Remember that if you\u2019re dedicated to the hobby, there\u2019s nothing wrong with paying a bit more for your first telescope, especially if it gives you access to beginner-friendly features that make your experience less frustrating. A final, often overlooked factor that beginners should consider is the size of the telescope. Beginners getting their first telescope can consider this problem from several angles. First, consider a full-scale telescope on a tripod. If you use it often, this large size really won\u2019t need to be considered as much in the same way that we don\u2019t concern ourselves with the space taken up by a washer or dryer. Some things are just the size that they are. Plus, a larger telescope will make for a more comfortable viewing posture while standing. But what if you aren\u2019t going to be using the telescope regularly? There\u2019s always this risk with a beginner hobby, as we\u2019re feeling things out and learning if we want to make them a regular practice or not. If the space taken up by the extended telescope and mount isn\u2019t too large for your space, they can make for an excellent display piece, and the conversations that your telescope will facilitate just might spark you into action, bringing out the telescope again with a buddy. Try to balance the space of your home and the telescope, or plan to put it away and store it somewhere. If you plan on putting it away and taking it back out regularly, it is essential that the mount is easy to put away and extend and that lens covers are sturdy and easily usable. A telescope for beginners can cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 or more. It all depends on what kind of beginner you are. If you want something cheap to embark on the hobby with, you can find it. However, if you want something that will automatically find objects for you and act as an on-demand expert guide, you can expect to pay more. Yes, telescopes are typically pretty easy to maintain and service if you\u2019re careful with them and don\u2019t drop them or scratch up the lenses. Most joints and moving parts are away from the precious lenses, meaning it is relatively easy to service them on your own. While lenses may be more tricky or expensive to maintain, the use of covers and proper procedures can act as \u201cpreventative service.\u201d Beginner telescopes run the full gamut, from fun telescopes with learning software that are meant for students to motorized telescopes with automatic celestial body-finding capabilities. The preceding list of telescopes will help you see the night sky and even some of the older stars in the universe on a more personal level, even as a beginner. Take your time, find a stable place to set up your scope, and get started. Using one of the best telescopes for beginners is a great way to elevate your armchair astronomy to the next level.

        "title": "See the first moments when 3 polar bear cubs emerge from their den | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted Yesterday It\u2019s a big world out there, especially for polar bear cubs emerging from their dens. An international team of researchers observed these special first steps thanks to nearly a decade of camera footage taken in remote Svalbard, Norway. The footage and its implications for polar bear conservation are detailed in a study published February 27 (International Polar Bear Day) in the Journal of Wildlife Management. Polar bear mothers in the Arctic generally give birth in early January around the start of the new year. The cubs are born completely blind, do not have their signature snow-colored fur, and generally weigh about one pound. After they are born, they begin to grow rapidly, nursing on milk that\u2019s about 31 percent fat. By the time they are ready to leave the den in the spring, they are up to 20 times bigger than they were at birth. The cubs begin to emerge from their birthing den sometime between February and April each year. The duration of the \u201cdenning period,\u201d the timing of when they come out of their dens, and the time spent at the den site after emergence can all impact the survival of polar bear cubs. Polar Bears International believes that fewer than 50 percent of cubs survive to adulthood. \u201cPolar bear mothers are having increasing difficulties reproducing due to climate-driven changes, and are likely to face further challenges with the expansion of the human footprint in the Arctic,\u201d Louise Archer, a study co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto Scarborough, said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re excited to introduce new tools to monitor bears during this vulnerable time and to gain insight into their behavior across the Arctic, so that we can work to protect cubs and therefore the species. Every den we monitored had its own story, every data point adds to our understanding of this crucial time and supports more effective conservation strategies.\u201d Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In this new study, female polar bears in Svalbard\u2013an archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole\u2013were fitted with GPS satellite collars. The devices recorded their location, activity levels, and body temperatures. The team then used the collar data to pinpoint where the dens were located. The team then trekked into Svalbard\u2019s mountains and set up timelapse cameras at 13 den sites from 2016 through 2020 and in 2023. The data from these cameras complemented the satellite tags with more detailed insights into maternal den behavior. The satellite collars are still accurate, but are more useful for monitoring the bears over extended periods and in more remote areas. The video footage and satellite tag data revealed some important behavioral information. Families emerged around March 9th in Svalbard and seemed to abandon the den earlier than previously observed in this population. More monitoring is needed to see if this is a trend, but changing the timing of denning could jeopardize cub survival since they have less time to develop before traveling to the sea ice. In some instances, the bears also emerged from the den for less than a minute before they went back inside. Other outings lasted several hours. As far as permanently leaving the den, the footage indicated that polar bears stay near their dens for an average of 12 days, but it varied between the families from two to 31 days. Additionally, some of the moms switched dens. They were observed leaving their original dens and then moving their family to a new den. The cubs also rely heavily on their mothers. They were only seen without their moms 5 percent of the time. Cubs in Svalbard generally depend on their mothers for up to 2.5 years. [ Related: How do polar bears keep ice off their fur? Grease.] According to the team, this combination of collar data and timelapse cameras show unique insights into very important denning behavior. Continued monitoring and the protection of known denning areas could help ensure the survival of future generations. \u201cThis study provides a rare glimpse into one of the most vulnerable and critical periods in a polar bear\u2019s life, offering insights that can help guide our collective conservation efforts,\u201d Megan Owen, Vice President of Wildlife Conservation Science at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said in a statement. \u201cBy combining innovative technology with long-term research, we\u2019re gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges polar bear moms and cubs face in a rapidly changing Arctic. Protecting denning habitats is essential for population health, and this study provides invaluable insights that will help guide protective management.\u201d Laura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she is particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology, nanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.

Learn more \u203a 64 ounces might sound like a giant water bottle and you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a lot of liquid. But, I\u2019ve been using a huge water bottle for years now and I\u2019ll never go back. Right now, Amazon has the black 64-ounce Hydro Flask Wide Mouth water bottle for just $29. That\u2019s 54 percent off of its regular $65 price tag. I have never seen it this cheap, even on shopping holidays like Black Friday. This will likely sell out before it ends, so grab one. Hydro Flask This is the classic Hydro Flask, with its wide-mouth opening that\u2019s compabitble with flat and straw lids.

        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 26, 2025 Recently analyzed fossils finally confirm a longtime paleontological theory: Flying squirrels the size of domesticated cats glided across the Bering Land Bridge roughly 5 million years ago. Although no longer native to North America, the ancestors to today\u2019s aerodynamic rodents likely made the most of the Early Pliocene\u2019s warmer climate. The new findings come from an international research team collaborating between East Tennessee State University and Spain\u2019s Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia, and are described in a study published on February 21 in the Journal of Mammalian Evolution. The discovery of a Miopetaurista webbi specimen at the Gray Fossil Site in Washington County, Tennessee, surprised paleontologists given what they previously understood about the creature\u2019s evolutionary journey. \u201cFinding Miopetaurista in North America was quite unexpected as this genus is only known from Eurasia,\u201d Isaac Casanovas-Vilar, a study co-author and Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia researcher, said in a statement. \u201cThere had been some uncertain reports from Florida, but the specimen of the Gray Fossil Site provided new information.\u201d Modern Southern Appalachia was much warmer during the Pliocene epoch, which lured\u00a0 prehistoric mammal species east after crossing the Bering Land Bridge. Due to its Eurasian origins, the Miopetaurista that eventually soared through the trees of Tennessee all the way down to Florida were more closely related to today\u2019s flying squirrels in China, Japan, and Indonesia than any North American squirrels. While roughly the size of a cat, Miopetaurista webbi only weighed about 3 pounds. Miopetaurista species are previously documented in areas of China, France, and Germany during both the Miocene (23-5.3 million years ago) and Pliocene (5.3\u20132.5 million years ago) epochs. But the discovery and dating of the Tennessee Miopetaurista webbi now means those flying squirrels were some of the last of their kind. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

        "title": "Krill or anchovy? Baleen whale songs may indicate what's on the menu | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted on Feb 26, 2025 For humpback whales in the Pacific, their songs may be a solid indicator of the type of food that is swimming nearby. By listening in on their songs from year to year, a team of scientists found variations in their tunes based on the species that are available for them to eat. The findings are detailed in a study published February 26 in the journal PLOS One. The Pacific Ocean is the largest body of water on Earth and monitoring populations of large marine mammals like whales can be challenging. According to NOAA, some humpback whales in the Northern Pacific migrate roughly 3,000 miles from Alaska to feed and then to Hawai\u2019i to breed. They can even complete this journey in only 28 days. Depending on the species, whale songs can also travel thousands of miles. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To monitor and track these baleen whales, scientists deploy underwater microphones called hydrophones. In the new study, the team monitored songs from blue, fin, and humpback whales. They followed the pods traveling off of the West Coast of the United States for six years, looking to see what song data might say about the health of their ecosystem. They found large variations in how often the whales were vocalizing over the six years of study. The humpback whale songs continually increased and were detected on 34 percent of days at the beginning of the study. They eventually rose to 76 percent of days after six years. This increase in song also consistently tracked alongside improved foraging conditions for humpback whales. Initially, there was a large increase in krill, shortly followed by a leap in anchovy abundance. By comparison, blue and fin whale song rose primarily during the years where krill was more plentiful. The increase of humpback whale songs is also consistent with their ability to switch between dominant prey. Skin biopsy samples confirmed that changes had occurred in the whales\u2019 diets. Other factors that may have contributed to the patterns include whether or not other whales were vocalizing nearby. However, the changes in foraging conditions were the most consistent factor in this study. [ Related: We finally know how baleen whales make noise. ] According to the team, these findings indicate that seasonal and yearly changes to the amount of baleen whale song might mirror changes in the local food web. A better understanding of the relationship between using whale song detection and the availability of krill, anchovy, and other fish may help researchers better interpret hydrophone data, \u201cSurprisingly, the acoustic behavior of baleen whales provides insights about which species can better adapt to changing ocean conditions,\u201d John Ryan, a study co-author and biological oceanographer at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute said in a statement. \u201cOur findings can help resource managers and policymakers better protect endangered whales.\u201d Laura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she is particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology, nanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.

        "title": "Morning lark or night owl? Prevailing ideas of mammal activity are outdated | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Lauren Leffer Posted on Feb 26, 2025 Squirrels are plentiful when the sun\u2019s out, while rats are a more common sight after dusk. Often, the former are described as diurnal, and the latter nocturnal. But for many animals, those labels are due for a revision. Most mammals\u2019 daily activity cycles aren\u2019t quite so cut and dry, according to a new study of global wildlife camera data. The rhythms of many species are more varied and flexible than previously thought, and those rhythms are shifting, in response to humans. The research, published February 26 in the journal Science Advances, combines nearly 9 million recorded observations into one of the most complete ever analyses of the timing of mammalian activity. It upends many commonly held assumptions about wildlife habits, and has consequences for conservation. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. \u201cYou see all these terms in the literature. This species is nocturnal, this one is diurnal. It sounds very authoritative, but we weren\u2019t so sure based on our collective field experience,\u201d Kadambari Devarajan, an ecologist and conservation biologist who co-led the study as part of her post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Rhode Island, tells Popular Science. \u201cAnecdotally, it seemed like there was a lot more plasticity,\u201d particularly in response to urbanization and human development. So, Devarajan and her collaborators took on the mammoth task of checking for themselves. The four core team members worked with hundreds of other researchers around the world to compile data from 200 camera trap projects across 38 countries. They organized and assessed this data based on factors like time of day, species, location, and daylight length given the date and geography. Then, they searched previously published research for mentions of each species\u2019 established activity pattern: nocturnal, diurnal, crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk), or cathemeral (active both day and night). Comparing the observational analysis with the research review revealed a significant mismatch. Just 39 percent of the 445 species captured on camera were accurately described in the previously published research. Common raccoons, for instance, are cataloged as nocturnal in the scientific literature, but hundreds of observations from around the Americas showed instances of raccoon activity in the day, night, and twilight. In many locations, the furry masked bandits tended towards nighttime movement, but in others they spanned the 24-hour schedule. Wider-ranging species tended to show more varied patterns. Between 60 and 73 percent of the species recorded in more than one project showed signs of at least two types of daily rhythms: some mixture of daytime, night, and twilight activity. Geography of any given population also had an influence: the farther animals were away from the equator, the more likely they were to be active during the day. Smaller species also tended to be more nocturnal overall, and increased daylight hours were correlated with more daytime animal activity. Amazingly, not one species included in the dataset showed an exclusively crepuscular pattern of dawn and dusk activity, as defined in the study, despite many animals being characterized as such in prior research. For example, white-tailed deer are generally described as twilight specialists, but according to the new photo evidence, they tend more towards intermittent bouts of both daytime and nighttime activity across much of their range. In some places, they seem to be active only during the day or only at night. Finally, where human environmental impacts like habitat loss and urbanization were more pronounced, animals were more likely to shift their schedules and display greater flexibility. In most instances, increased human influence tended to push wildlife towards nighttime activity, in agreement with past research. Striped skunks, gray foxes, and American porcupines\u2013 along with more than a dozen other mammals were more likely to be nocturnal in highly developed areas. A handful of animals, like the common tapeti (a species of South American rabbit) also demonstrated the opposite effect\u2013becoming more active during the day. All of the study\u00a0 results can be explored in detail via a publicly shared online tool. \u201cThe ambition of what they did in terms of the number of observations and also how they set out to test these typical classifications is novel and important,\u201d says Cole Burton, a conservation biologist and associate professor at the University of British Columbia who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research. Burton has previously conducted large camera trap studies of wildlife, including one assessing how animals responded to human activity amid pandemic lockdowns. Though more narrow in scope, his own work also showed that many mammals are flexible about their activity timing. In light of the new research, he wonders if there\u2019s any point in strictly defining mammalian patterns at all. \u201cMaybe we should be moving to a more continuous understanding\u2013a spectrum\u2013rather than trying to put the animals in these neat little boxes.\u201d Individual wildlife populations might be better understood via timetable than a label, Burton suggests. The idea goes beyond just terminology. Decades of\u00a0 previous scientific research has incorporated these apparently oversimplified animal activity categories into ecology models, to help scientists grasp animal\u2019s niches and interactions with each other. The new study implies species\u2019 previously understood ecological roles may not be so concrete and contained. \u201cBased on this camera trap data set, those old classifications often don\u2019t hold,\u201d says Burton. \u201cThat is a really important result for people to be aware of, especially those who are using those kinds of traits in their models.\u201dThen, there are the ramifications for wildlife itself. \u201cA lot of conservation studies have focused on spatial distribution patterns, but the temporal component may be just as important,\u201d says Devarajan. \u201cWhen an animal is active and when it needs access to certain resources could be critical for protecting a species.\u201d As the study title says, it\u2019s not just where the wild things are, but when. Everything from train schedules, traffic patterns, trash collection, and public park hours could either lead to human-wildlife conflict, or be adjusted with conservation in mind. Getting a better grasp on wildlife habits could allow land managers to preserve time slots as well as spaces for species to thrive undisturbed. [ Related: Mountain lions in Los Angeles become night owls to avoid humans. ] Yet first, more research is needed. Though sweeping and impressive, both Devarajan and Burton note the new study has limitations. The researchers didn\u2019t look directly at human activity to determine its influence on animals, using development and urban density as an imperfect proxy instead. The study is one of the first times scientists have tried to quantify each type of animal tendency, but in doing so, their definitions may have been overly restrictive.Their camera trap dataset is incomplete; it doesn\u2019t account for every region around the world and is biased towards dry season observations because of the difficulty of maintaining a camera through monsoons. These gaps mean they didn\u2019t directly model the effect of seasonal change for any of their data\u2013 despite the fact that animal activity is known to shift throughout the year. Finally, the study doesn\u2019t offer any insight into how these apparent shifts in animal activity are impacting wildlife. Follow-up research comparing specific populations of a species over time will be needed to understand if changing rhythms is a useful adaptation or detrimental in the long-term. \u201cWhat we really need to know is, is this working out for them,\u201d Burton says. \u201cOr is it too much of a cost?\u201d \u201cDespite mammals being relatively well studied, we need to maintain a certain humility. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Burton. \u201cI feel like animals are working hard to adapt to us and how we\u2019ve changed the environment. Being aware of that and trying to understand that helps us help them be successful in those changes, so they actually lead to coexistence.\u201d By Mack DeGeurin By Andrew Paul By Laura Baisas By Laura Baisas By Laura Baisas By Popular Science Team By Andrew Paul By Andrew Paul By Laura Baisas By Laura Baisas By Tom Hawking By Laura Baisas By Mack DeGeurin By Andrew Paul By Laura Baisas By Lauren Leffer By Laura Baisas By Andrew Paul By Laura Baisas By Laura Baisas By Lauren Leffer By Popular Science Team By Popular Science Team By Laura Baisas By Laura Baisas By Lauren Leffer Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

        "title": "Subtle differences identified in brains of people with schizophrenia | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Tom Hawking Posted on Feb 26, 2025 Schizophrenia might be among the most intensely studied mental illnesses. However, its causes\u2014and the way those causes manifest in the brain\u2014remain frustratingly elusive. A new study published February 26 in the American Journal of Psychiatry examines physical differences between the brains of people who experience schizophrenia and those who do not. Wolfgang Omlor, a study co-author and psychiatrist from the University of Zurich in Switzerland, tells Popular Science that \u201cwhile schizophrenia may have its own mechanisms shaping brain structure and function, these processes remain far from fully understood.\u201d To identify trends in physical features common to the brains of people with schizophrenia, Omlor and his team combed through data from the global Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) database covering 6,037 people. They saw two potential features: an increased uniformity of folding patterns in a part of the brain called the right caudal anterior cingulate region, and an increased variability in the thickness of the cerebral cortex. An immediate question is whether these features could contribute to causing schizophrenia, or whether they\u2019re caused by the condition. Similarly, it\u2019s not clear whether these features are innate, or develop over the course of a person\u2019s life. Omlor explains that because this study is \u201ccomparing individuals already diagnosed with schizophrenia to controls,\u201d it can\u2019t address the question of causation. As far as whether these features are something with which a person is born, or whether they develop over the course of life, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s likely a combination of both. Some features may be present from early development, while others can emerge later, influenced by factors like medication or chronic stress that reshape the brain through neuroplasticity.\u201d According to Omlor, cortical folding appears to fall into the category of features present from early development and is mostly established before birth and into early childhood. However, schizophrenia itself tends to manifest in late adolescence/early adulthood. This raises the possibility that these folding patterns represent some sort of predisposition to schizophrenia; whether or not this results in the onset of the actual condition, however, will depend on any number of other factors. The folding of cerebral tissue is one of the brain\u2019s most distinctive features. In general, \u201cfolding increases the brain\u2019s surface area in limited space and is thought to influence how neurons connect,\u201d Omlor says. Subtle differences in the nature of the way that brain tissue is folded are also a feature of other conditions, although it\u2019s difficult to identify what exact effect such differences have. \u201cSome neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism) also show altered cortical folding,\u201d he says. \u201cThe implications of such differences aren\u2019t fully understood, but the more uniform folding in schizophrenia\u2019s anterior cingulate could point to a more constrained developmental process in that region.\u201d Exactly how these folding patterns might interact with the development and nature of the condition remains an open question, but Omlor theorizes that \u201cthe uniform folding patterns may reflect a less flexible interplay between genes and environment at these earlier stages [of development].\u201d It certainly seems notable that the folds manifest in the right caudal anterior cingulate region, a part of the brain that integrates cognitive and emotional processes. However, a single role should not be given part of the brain. \u201cBrain regions generally work together in complex networks.So while we do see more uniform folding [in the right caudal anterior cingulate region] in schizophrenia, it\u2019s best not to think of [that region]\u00a0 as solely \u2018responsible\u2019 for any single task,\u201d he says.\u201cRather, it\u2019s part of a broader circuit linking thought and emotion.\u201d The study\u2019s second finding is a \u201cgreater variability in cortical thickness\u201d in individuals with schizophrenia. As an example of how nothing related to the brain is ever simple, this isn\u2019t merely a question of people with schizophrenia having \u201cbigger\u201d or \u201csmaller\u201d cerebral cortices. Instead, one person\u2019s cortex might be thinner in some parts and thicker in others, while another might be just the opposite\u2014so even though those two people\u2019s cortices might have the same overall volume, their internal make-up might be quite different. In people with schizophrenia, there is a broader spread of such variation in thickness. The subtleties involved here reflect the fact that the brain\u2019s dizzying complexity means it\u2019s rarely possible to draw simple conclusions. Even in this case, where a basic interpretation might be that schizophrenia is linked to the volume of the cerebral cortex, the answer is not that straightforward. \u201cGreater variability of cortical thickness in schizophrenia reflects a broader range beyond a \u2018more\u2019 or \u2018less\u2019 pattern, underscoring the disorder\u2019s complexity,\u201d says Omlor. However, it does appear possible to correlate these differences with the myriad ways in which schizophrenia presents. \u201cWe also found that variations in specific brain regions correlate with schizophrenia symptom domains, suggesting these structural differences mirror the diverse presentations of the condition,\u201d Omlor says. Ultimately, one key takeaway from this study is that the way in which schizophrenia presents in a person is as unique as that person themselves. Similarly, it appears that there\u2019s no single way in which schizophrenia can be reflected in a person\u2019s brain. If anything, there\u2019s perhaps a set of regions in which the condition manifests, but the ways in which it can do so appear to be many and varied. Approaching schizophrenia in this individualistic manner isn\u2019t merely an abstract consideration. Instead, a better understanding of how and why the condition varies from person to person could \u201cguide more individualized precision-medicine efforts\u2026 by recognizing these differences early on, clinicians and researchers can work toward treatments better suited to each person\u2019s unique profile,\u201d according to Omlor.

        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 26, 2025 Japan\u2019s high-speed bullet trains are famous for speeding across the country\u2014but China wants to set a new world record for the fastest electric passenger rail. Prototype tests are reportedly underway on the nation\u2019s upcoming line of CR450 trains, and according to the Ministry of Transport, they already can reach top test speeds as fast as 281 mph. The CR450 is the latest in China\u2019s line of Fuxing (\u201cRejuvenation\u201d) electric trains, and is expected to run at around 248.5 mph, surpassing the current CR400 trains\u2019 217 mph operational speeds. For comparison, Japan\u2019s Shinkansen electric trains typically max out at 186 mph, and while a modified version of France\u2019s Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse (TGV) maintains the world record for fastest wheeled train (357.2 mph), its standard version zips along at around 200 mph. The eight-car CR450 design relies on what\u2019s known as a water-cooled advanced permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) system that allows at least a 3 percent increase in energy conversion efficiency compared to previous models. Like all of China\u2019s other passenger rails, the trains will receive power through the country\u2019s network of 25kV 50Hz AC overhead catenary lines. They will also feature a storage battery array capable of providing the CR450 with a 110V DC power source. Each train houses over 4,000 sensors to monitor all the crucial moving parts, including its fire detection systems, car body, emergency braking, and pantograph\u2014the roof-mounted device that converts electricity from catenary line to the train itself. A video provided by CCTV offers glimpses of the new CR450 design, but no clear shots of it reaching the speeds expected. Instead, the clip mostly focuses on ongoing weight control work, which is important to ensure the train\u2019s overall mass won\u2019t cause any structural problems while in transit.

This involves structural changes and material innovations.\u201d As Interesting Engineering noted, the CR450 prototypes have so far passed static and low-speed dynamic tests for noise control, braking, and traction, with developers hoping to increase speeds over successive trial phases. The CR450 is expected to be delivered to China Railway by the end of the year, with a second line slated for 2027 that will run the 181 mi between the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing in under 50 minutes.

So, whether you\u2019re just getting ready to build your system or looking to expand your existing equipment, we\u2019ll explain some of the jargon and guide you toward selecting the best speaker wires for crystal-clear audio. To select the best speaker wires, we looked at wire material, gauge, and manufacturer to ensure reliability across the board. We looked at over 25 recommended brands, consulted research articles, and investigated first-hand user reviews, diving deep into the debate regarding the relationship between wire quality and price. We also looked at our personal stereo speakers and home theater systems, recommending wires we used to provide a personal touch. While it\u2019s ultimately up to you to determine whether you hear a significant difference in audio quality using particular wires, each of our picks will provide a strong, sturdy connection for excellent sound. There is much debate about whether expensive speaker wires perform significantly better than lower-priced models. The general consensus is no; listening tests and extensive research led by audio professionals agree that the quality of your speaker wire will likely be the same across the board. We recommend reaching for a speaker cable that is solidly in the middle of the pricing spectrum; the cheapest cable might not be built to last, while the most expensive cable may not improve the quality of your audio. Our recommendations let you save money for more critical pieces of gear. Why it made the cut: The Monoprice 12-AWG cable is a safe, affordable option for at-home and professional systems. The thick gauge is sturdy, and the clear PVC jacket means you can easily identify polarity. Specs This 12-gauge speaker wire is made from 99.95 percent pure oxygen-free bare copper that creates a low resistance pathway, allowing signals to pass through easily. The jacket is made from transparent PVC, which lets you watch the copper wire to look out for any signs of damage and distinguish polarity. Why it made the cut: InstallGear 14-gauge wire is thick enough to reduce resistance. It includes features to make installation easy, including a soft, colored jacket and the option for included connectors. Specs This InstallGear speaker wire is particularly popular for car speaker systems but can also be used for home systems where you want driving sound. The dual-colored jacket makes it easy to identify polarity, and it\u2019s made from soft PVC, so it\u2019s easy to maneuver under carpets, behind side panels, and through small openings (plus you can strip it quickly). You can also purchase InstallGear wires with banana plugs to simplify things even further. If blue and black aren\u2019t for you, InstallGear also offers wires with different jackets so that you can choose your preferred color combination, including clear, solid white, and solid black options. Why it made the cut: The MaxBrite speaker wire comes with features we love, including markings every 2 feet of wire for straightforward measurements and a polarity indicator. Specs This thin, 16-gauge wire is an excellent option for low-impedance speakers and shorter cable runs, like from a receiver to the front stereo and satellite speakers around the TV in a cozy, comfy living room. The OFC conductors are compatible with most available connectors and a visible red stripe helps to indicate polarity. There is a sequential marker every 2 feet, so you can more easily measure out the necessary length. Additionally, this wire is UL safety certified for home and commercial use. Why it made the cut: This Monoprice cable is a reliable four-conductor speaker wire for additional connectivity made from quality oxygen-free copper. Specs Where the other products listed here have two conductors for a one-to-one connection, this wire contains twice as many. Additional conductors can be used for bi-amping, a feature in some speakers allowing you to separately power drivers dedicated to specific frequencies. The Monoprice bi-wire organizes four colored conductors encased in a white, CL2-rated PVC jacket, allowing you to link the dedicated high- and low-frequency amplifiers with your speaker while only stringing one length. Why it made the cut: This GearIT wire is our top selection for outdoor use because it has a UL CL3 rating and is approved for direct burial. Specs If you want to run your speaker wires underground, you\u2019ll need a wire designed for direct burial to keep you and your connection safe. This wire from GearIT does just that, with an extra black, UV-resistant PVC jacket to keep things secure. This outer jacket also has sequential markings every foot for more accurate measurement approximations. Each wire has a color-coded jack inside the outer layer for polarity identification. This wire is also approved for in-wall installation and pairs easily with most connectors. Why it made the cut: The AmazonBasics speaker wire is an excellent budget-friendly option with glowing reviews that espouse its functionality. While it may not be top-of-the-line or feature pure copper, it will get the job done for at-home systems. Specs If you are putting together a home system and don\u2019t care to weigh in on the CCA versus OFC material debate, then going with this affordable option won\u2019t lead you astray. This 16-gauge wire is wrapped in a clear plastic jacket, with a white line down one side to indicate polarity. While this pick isn\u2019t as visible as color-coded jackets, you\u2019ll still be able to tell how to establish each channel\u2019s symmetry between amp and speaker. It\u2019s compatible with almost any connector and is neatly wrapped around a plastic dispenser. Tony Ware Why it made the cut: To get the most balanced sound, it helps to turn to a speaker cable with the most balanced construction. Specs Say you\u2019re investing in a pair of premium floor-standing speakers (like the GoldenEar T66 shown above). It\u2019s probably because you have a medium to large room and want to make the most of it with components that cast an enhanced soundstage. To ensure you can get that spacious reproduction, you should look to the gauge that will engage, and this speaker cable offers all the clarity you want with all the connections you need. This particular variant features single cold-welded banana plugs on the amp end, with a corresponding set of dual inputs on the speaker terminal side, as we currently don\u2019t use discrete amps for woofers and tweeters but prefer not to use jumpers. (We assume the type of speaker that would justify this admittedly pricey cable can and will be bi-wired, but there are other variations and lengths.) Internally, spiral bundles of shielded, uninterrupted conductors\u2014one dedicated to bass and one to treble\u2014maximize efficient transfer and minimize disruptive interaction. Additional insulation inside the red-and-grey braided cover helps dissipate interference. The end result is an easily integrated cable that will help you visualize each instrument\u2019s place in the mix in a form that\u2019s visually appealing enough to leave in plain view. Sure, it\u2019s a much higher cost, but you\u2019re investing in more low-level resolution in a robust product that\u2019s a low-lift compared to stripping and binding DIY interconnects. There are a seemingly infinite number of speaker wires to choose from, but the reality is that when connecting most speakers, most wires are fairly similar. To select the right speaker wire for you, it\u2019s essential to consider and understand the language manufacturers will use to describe them. We\u2019ll walk you through terms like impedance, gauge, and resistance to help you select from our recommendations. Speaker wire connects speakers to AV receivers and discrete amplifiers and links individual speakers together to deliver the electrical current signal for an accurate, energetic sound. While we refer to a speaker wire as a singular thing, there are actually two independently sheathed conductors (minimum) that connect every speaker. These separate positive and negative strands are typically marked in some way to indicate audio signal polarity so they can properly match the same terminals\u2014designated by + and \u2013 or typically colored red and black\u2014on both your amp and speaker. This assures they transmit/receive the correct voltage. Standard speaker wires are generally made from copper, copper-clad aluminum (CCA), and oxygen-free copper. The differences are relatively minute; CCA is cheaper with slightly higher resistance, while oxygen-free options come in several grades that suggest higher conductivity or durability. Silver and gold wires are also available, though the difference in efficacy is, once again, minimal. While there can be subtle differences in sound\u2014silver (or silver-plated copper) wire may convey a tighter treble and gold a rounder, warmer lower range\u2014the nuances aren\u2019t worth the increased cost except in the most high-end, specifically tuned systems. Speaker wire is often insulated by plastic like Teflon or PVC. However, some wires are sheathed in rubber (clear casings let you see the red/black polarity, typically indicated on the connectors of a preconstructed wire). A speaker wire\u2019s resistance is the most important specification when shopping. Low resistance allows the wire to energize more of the amplifier\u2019s power to activate the speaker\u2019s voice coil, which is wiring underneath the driver that produces a magnetic field when introduced to electricity, moving the speaker\u2019s cone when introduced to a waveform. (If you\u2019re interested in exactly what makes up a speaker, check out our primer.) In simplest terms, more signal equals cleaner, clearer sound. A few factors can affect a wire\u2019s resistance, including length, thickness, and impedance. Impedance is often listed in speaker product descriptions, measured in ohms (typically 4, 6, or 8). While you don\u2019t necessarily need to understand the science behind impedance other than to know that you should ensure the ohms of your amp/receiver and speakers correspond, know that the lower the impedance, the more critical it is to seek out a low resistance in your wire. A major difference between speaker wires is gauge, or diameter, also called thickness; the lower the gauge number, the thicker the wire. Measurements are based on the American Wire Gauge (AWG) standard, and you can find 12-, 14-, 16-, and 18-gauge speaker wire, 12 being the thickest. Generally, thicker wires reduce resistance but are only necessary for certain situations. If you have 8-ohm speakers and under 50 feet of cable run to the amplifier, you don\u2019t need a wire thicker than 16 gauge. If you need to cover a great distance or have low-impedance speakers, a thicker 12- or 14-gauge wire will lower resistance and make for a more stable, consistent conduit. If you\u2019re unsure what gauge you need, it is safer to use a thicker option to avoid sound degradation. Speaker wires can come with or without connectors; it\u2019s up to you to decide whether to purchase a package or get a raw wire spool and separately select your own termination. (And if you\u2019re doing that, don\u2019t forget to get a wire stripper/cutter.) A banana plug is best if your speaker has a binding post (circular sockets), but you\u2019ll need a pin connector for a spring clip terminal (square clips that slide up and clamp down on the wire). You can use bare wires for either connection, but they can be a bit of a pain to control. You don\u2019t need to worry about wire type if you are running speaker wire between bookshelf speakers or studio monitors, for instance. To run wire inside your walls\u2014if, say, you\u2019re building a home studio from the ground up\u2014look for a unit rated CL2 or CL3. If you are running wire outside and/or underground, look for a wire rated for \u201cdirect burial.\u201d Quality speaker wire can cost between $15 \u2013 $75 for spools that typically come in 50- or 100-foot lengths. High-end speaker cables are not necessarily worth the investment, especially when other areas of your sound system could benefit from an upgrade. As long as you select a low-resistance speaker wire that can support your system, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll notice a difference in your music when supported by an expensive cable. However, this is a hotly debated topic, and a handful of audiophiles feel differently. Ultimately, all that matters is how your material sounds to your ears; if you try out a few cables and notice a difference, go with what sounds best. You need as much speaker wire as you have distance between speakers and the amplifiers. For maximum accuracy, place a string or rope along the wire\u2019s intended path, then measure its length. We recommend adding a couple of inches on either end, just in case you need a bit of slack. Speaker wires can be easily trimmed with a wire cutter, but you can\u2019t add wire to a unit that\u2019s too short. Remember, if your cable run is longer than 50 feet, you\u2019ll want to pick up a thicker 12 or 14 AWG wire. You need a copper, silver, or copper-clad aluminum wire to conduct and carry electricity. If you want to run your wire inside a wall or underground, you\u2019ll need one specifically rated CL2 or CL3. If you want super easy installation, purchase a wire that comes with the appropriate connectors preinstalled, though using bare wire is not dangerous and will also work well. The best speaker wire will efficiently connect your system, deliver the appropriate amount of electricity, and aid in accurate audio reproduction. While there are many cables out there, in most situations, it\u2019s important to remember not to overthink this purchase and go with a mid-range option that will suit the needs of your amp and speakers. The wire should maybe be 5% to 10% of your system\u2019s budget. Of course, if you\u2019re an audiophile ready to test the limits of each type of wire, it might be worth it to conduct a test of your own with higher-end materials; however, many of us won\u2019t notice the difference between premium speaker wires and more affordable options as much as we\u2019ll notice the difference between music and no music. Just ensure you understand the proper length you need, line up your terminals and polarities correctly, and you\u2019ll be ready to pump up the jams in no time.

        "text": "By Jeremy Helligar, Brandt Ranj Updated on Apr 13, 2023 We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more \u203a If the shopping gods ever decide to compile a list of things you don\u2019t think you need but actually do, a laptop stand for your desk will probably nab a spot near the top of it. The benefits of them, though not necessarily endless, are indeed impressive. Most importantly, they\u2019re ergonomic\u2014these desk accessories bring laptop screens up to eye level, so you aren\u2019t constantly bending your neck downward and hunching your shoulders forward while you type. A laptop stand can improve your posture while you work as it eases the strain on your neck and back. They also make it easier to use an external keyboard with a laptop. You can place it at desk level, and if you have a dual-rise laptop stand, you can pull it forward over the keyboard while bringing the laptop screen closer to you. On the non-ergonomic side, a laptop riser will help prevent your laptop from overheating by allowing the air around it to circulate more freely. This slows down the drain on your battery and helps keep your laptop working more efficiently. Finally, some stands can be used to make your work area similar to a standing desk, which is a great way to tackle two functions in one item. Just extend it up to a comfortable height so that you can get off your seat and stretch your torso while continuing to reap the posture and back benefits of the best laptop stand for desks. At their core, laptop stands are single-use tools that function nearly identically to one another, so our research and testing focused on finding the ideal choice for your particular preferences. If you prioritize ergonomics (by way of height adjustment), want to reduce your laptop\u2019s footprint on your desk while it\u2019s connected to an external display, or aim to spend the least amount of money possible without making serious compromises, we have you covered. Our recommendations all come from well-known companies with a solid reputation, which means you shouldn\u2019t ever have to upgrade your laptop stand unless your needs or preferences change. When it comes to choosing the best laptop stand for desks, your options might not be quite as plentiful as they are when you\u2019re picking out a laptop to place on top of it, but that actually makes the task less daunting. Plus, you\u2019ve got us to help! And by the way, for those who do their best work while sitting up in bed, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got the perfect laptop stand for you, too. Specs You\u2019ll find a lot to like with Grovemade\u2019s Wood Laptop Riser. This stand is made up of two pieces: A combo of American black walnut and Eastern Hardrock maple plywood attached to a brushed aluminum frame. The laptop stand is guaranteed to improve the aesthetics of any desk without compromising ergonomics. This laptop stand doesn\u2019t support height adjustment, but it can raise your laptop to the perfect spot for use with an external display. If your computer monitor supports height adjustment, you can make your tweaks there. One of Grovemade\u2019s clever design decisions was to include a pair of holes in the aluminum part of this frame, which allows you to thread your charging cable through it. This is a nice touch that can help clean desk clutter and give you easy cable management. Aluminum laptop stands can scratch the bottom of your computer\u2014Grovemade accounted for this and covered the top of this stand with soft felt. The company offers its stand in walnut or maple finishes, so select the one that best fits the color of your desk and other tech accessories. We\u2019ve had the opportunity to check out this laptop stand for ourselves, and the pictures don\u2019t do it justice. The solid feeling of the wood alone can justify its high price tag. During our time with this laptop stand, we never once wished it was height adjustable, which speaks to the time Grovemade spent to make sure it was as ergonomic as possible. Yes, this laptop stand is roughly three times more expensive than most of our other recommendations, but it\u2019s also the best-looking and packs a lot of quality. If you\u2019re redoing your home office and don\u2019t want to make any compromises, Grovemade\u2019s Wood Laptop Riser deserves a spot on your desk. Specs Twelve South\u2019s HiRise was designed to match the aesthetics of Apple\u2019s laptops, and while it\u2019ll look best with a Mac, it\u2019ll work just as well with a PC. The all-aluminum laptop stand can be height adjusted between 3.7 and 5.6 inches, which doesn\u2019t seem like a lot\u2014however, that makes a big difference when it comes to comfort. The top of this laptop stand\u2019s V-shaped arms is covered with rubber, which will prevent the bottom of your laptop from getting scratched. This design has the added benefit of promoting constant airflow to keep your computer from overheating. We\u2019ve had the opportunity to try many of Twelve South\u2019s accessories and always found them to be constructed very well\u2014the company also says they\u2019re designed to last a lifetime. If you need a height-adjustable laptop riser, this is the one we recommend regardless of the computer you use. If you happen to have a MacBook, even better. Specs There are many vertical laptop stands available, but this one from Satechi has a unique design that helps it stand out. The stand\u2019s grips can be widened or tightened by twisting a knob on its right side. This allows the stand to grab your laptop snugly to prevent it from tipping over while in use. Satechi says its laptop stand is compatible with laptops between half an inch and one and a half inches, which basically covers about every laptop on the market. This laptop stand is made entirely from aluminum, except for the inside of its grips, which are lined with rubber to prevent it from scratching the lip of your computer. Your laptop will take up way less of your desktop\u2019s real estate with the help of this vertical laptop stand. That space can be used for other peripherals like a 4K monitor or wireless mechanical keyboard. This laptop stand also helps keep your work area clean, as you can route cables to the underside of your desk, or let them hang off the back. We\u2019ve tested this laptop stand for ourselves and found it works very well. It securely gripped our 13-inch MacBook Pro\u2014the computer didn\u2019t leave the stand when we performed a lift test. You can\u2019t use your computer\u2019s screen while it\u2019s inside the vertical laptop stand. If you have a big external display, this won\u2019t be an issue, but beware if you\u2019ve gotten accustomed to a two-screen work setup. If this isn\u2019t an issue, you can pick up this laptop stand with complete confidence. Specs If you like the idea of having a laptop stand everywhere you go, MOFT\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d option is right for you. The ultra-slim laptop stand attaches to the underside of your computer using an adhesive. It\u2019s thin and light enough that you\u2019ll still be able to fit it in the laptop pocket of a backpack, and won\u2019t notice it while you\u2019re walking around. When you need the laptop stand, you can flip it out and set your computer at a 15- or 25-degree angle. It can\u2019t be height adjusted, but we\u2019re glad this laptop stand has that ergonomic feature. If you\u2019re worried about MOFT\u2019s laptop stand being a permanent addition to your computer, don\u2019t be. You can peel this stand off of your computer at any time, though its adhesive will become less sticky over time. Ideally, you\u2019d keep this laptop stand installed indefinitely, but that may not always be possible. If you\u2019re fine with the idea of adding a smidgen of weight and bulk to your portable computer in exchange for never leaving your laptop stand at home again, this model from MOFT is the right choice. Specs Amazon Basics\u2019 Aluminum Portable Laptop Stand lives up to its name, but in this case, basic doesn\u2019t mean bad. Its kickstand flips out from the bottom to position your laptop at an 18-degree angle while lifting it by roughly three inches. When you\u2019re not using it, the kickstand can be retracted to save space. Layers of rubber on the front and back of this stand will prevent it from shifting around on your desk while you\u2019re using it. This is especially important with an angled stand since you\u2019ll likely be using your laptop\u2019s keyboard with it. Amazon designed its laptop stand with cutouts that both reduce its weight and leave wide open spaces for air to flow in and out continuously. This is a design feature that we wouldn\u2019t expect from a laptop stand that costs far less than $20. It doesn\u2019t have any bells and whistles, but Amazon Basics\u2019 Aluminum Portable Laptop Stand can improve the ergonomics of your home office at an extremely reasonable price. If height adjustability isn\u2019t a must-have feature for you, this laptop stand should suit your needs just fine. Despite having the same function\u2014hoisting your laptop to a more comfortable level\u2014no two laptop stands are made alike. Here\u2019s what to look for when shopping for a new laptop stand: Laptop stands can be categorized into three distinct types: risers, vertical holders, and angled. Don\u2019t worry, despite their differences, there\u2019s no wrong choice here. A riser will elevate your laptop to the height of an external display, so it\u2019s the best choice if you\u2019ve got a dual-screen work setup. Vertical holders will hold your laptop upright while it\u2019s closed, which will optimize your desk space but requires you to hook your computer up to an external display. Angled laptop stands will prop your notebook computer slightly upward, so you can continue to use its built-in keyboard in a more comfortable way. Part of a laptop stand\u2019s appeal is improving the overall comfort of working at a desk all day. Some stands are completely static, which means you can\u2019t adjust the height or angle of your notebook computer, while others give you the flexibility to change both. In our experience, laptop stands that don\u2019t support height or angle adjustments were designed to provide comfort in almost every scenario\u2014keeping your laptop level with most people\u2019s eye lines while sitting down. Still, if you\u2019re particular about the positioning of your laptop screen, this is something to keep in mind. Many of us consider a laptop stand computer accessory, and while that\u2019s true it\u2019s also a mini piece of furniture on your desk. This means you\u2019ll need to be mindful of how much space it takes up. If you have a large computer or standing desk, this won\u2019t be an issue, but it\u2019ll make a huge difference if you\u2019re working on a smaller space. You\u2019ll need to consider both the width of the stand\u2019s base, and whether you\u2019ll have enough vertical space for your laptop if you\u2019re using an external display. Value is always an important consideration when choosing a piece of gear, and laptop stands are no different. A majority of our laptop stand recommendations cost less than $50, with some options falling under $20. However, they can cost upwards of $200 if it\u2019s made of fancier materials, like wood. Although you can get years of use out of a laptop that\u2019s placed directly on top of a desk, a laptop stand is worth it because it boosts both your laptop and the way it functions while extending its lifespan. They\u2019re ergonomic, so your back and neck will reap benefits, too. The main qualities of a good laptop stand are portability, adjustability, and flexibility. You should be able to at least transport it around the house with relative ease and maneuver it to suit different workspaces and multiple users. A laptop stand should be high enough so that your eye level is one or two inches below the top of the screen when you\u2019re sitting up straight. The key is that you shouldn\u2019t have to hunch over and tilt your neck downward while looking at the screen. Yes. A vertical stand is a solid choice if you\u2019re low on desk space and don\u2019t need to use your laptop\u2019s built-in screen while you work. Yes. A laptop stand will lift your computer off a desk, where airflow is severely restricted, into the air, where the fans can continually cool down your machine more easily. The best laptop stands for desks can work ergonomic wonders for your neck and back while keeping your device safe from overheating. Spend a little bit more money for an adjustable model that the whole family can enjoy and a laptop stand that you can use when you\u2019re away from the desk, whether it\u2019s on the couch, at the dining room table, or in bed. You won\u2019t know how you got by for so long without one. Popular Science\u00a0started writing about technology more than 150 years ago.

        "text": "By Popular Science Team Posted on Feb 26, 2025 What\u2019s the weirdest thing you learned this week? Well, whatever it is, we promise you\u2019ll have an even weirder answer if you listen to PopSci\u2019s hit podcast. \nThe Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week hits Apple, Spotify, YouTube, and everywhere else you listen to podcasts every-other Wednesday morning. It\u2019s your new favorite source for the strangest science-adjacent facts, figures, and Wikipedia spirals the editors of Popular Science can muster. If you like the stories in this post, we guarantee you\u2019ll love the show. By Lauren Leffer Silver carp pose a big threat to freshwater ecosystems\u2026 and also recreational boaters in the U.S. The invasive fish, which can be more than three feet long and upwards of 20 pounds, feed near the water\u2019s surface and are easily startled. When boaters go by, the fish leap out of the water by the dozen, and are liable to hit anything in their path\u2014including people. Even when they go undisturbed by humans, the fish still manage to sow chaos. They outcompete native species for food, and cause a complete reorganization of local ecosystems in the waterways where they establish. Already, they\u2019ve triggered native species declines in the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers and watersheds. And they\u2019re on the cusp of gaining some big ground. Silver carp are less than 50 miles away from entering Lake Michigan. From there, they could subsequently spread through all of the Great Lakes and the rivers that feed into the lakes. Yet mysteriously, something has been holding them at bay for almost a decade. Unfortunately, science increasingly suggests that thing might be urban water pollution. What\u2019s a conservation manager to do? Listen closely to the latest episode of\u00a0The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week to ponder this environmental conundrum. By Rachel Feltman In October 1968, the deep-sea submersible Alvin was preparing for a routine dive off the coast of Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Then a crucial cable snapped. Luckily, the hatch was still open\u2014so everyone made it out okay. But unluckily, the hatch was open\u2014so the vessel sank 5,000 feet to the ocean floor. It would remain there for nearly a year before being recovered. Alvin made it back to the surface in surprisingly good shape\u2026 and so did some of its cargo. Inside the sub, researchers discovered a metal lunchbox packed with apples, thermoses of beef bouillon, and six bologna sandwiches, all remarkably well-preserved. The sandwiches were only slightly soggy, the apples looked \u201cpickled,\u201d and despite a grayish tint, the bologna was still pink in the middle. Scientists were baffled. How had this meal survived nearly a year without rotting? In this episode, we explore the incredible journey of Alvin, the strange science of deep-sea decay, and why microbes in the drink just don\u2019t seem up to the task of making a sandwich go bad. And, of course, we have to ask the question\u2014who in their right mind actually took a bite? By Laura Baisis We know that dolphins and even dogs can surf in the water\u2014according to viral videos in the early YouTube days. Apparently, bats can also surf. But instead of cruising through the water, the spooky little guys surf the air. A recent study published in the journal Science found that when some of these winged mammals take on long-haul journeys, they will surf along the warm fronts of storms so that they can make it further while spending less energy. They\u2019re working smarter, not harder, and taking advantage of the air to travel a longer distance with less work The study looked at a group of common noctule bats. These bats are found across parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa and are one of only four bat species that are known to migrate across all of Europe. Using tiny sensors, the team was able to track the bats\u2019 migration. They found that changes in air temperature had a strong association with migratory flight. The bats were more likely to begin their movements just before warm fronts came in, leaving on nights where the air pressure dropped and temperature spiked. They appear to be leaving before incoming storms and then \u201csurfing\u201d along the air movements that come with warm fronts, like drops in barometric pressure, temperature, and better wind. Importantly, these findings could have implications for bat conservation. Bats can be susceptible to injury from wind turbines, so knowing when migrating bats might be in the area could allow engineers enough time to periodically shut down turbines.

        "title": "Like babies and dancers, this robot learns from studying itself | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Mack DeGeurin Posted on Feb 25, 2025 Credit: Columbia Engineering Researchers from Columbia University have successfully developed an autonomous robot arm capable of learning new motions and adapting to damage simply by watching itself move. The robot observed a video of itself and then used that data to plan its next actions\u2014a practice the researchers refer to as \u201ckinematic self-awareness.\u201d This unique learning process is designed to mimic the way humans adjust certain movements by watching themselves in a mirror. Teaching robots to learn this way could reduce the need for extensive training in bespoke 3D simulations. It could also one day make future autonomous robots operating in the real world better equipped to adapt to damage and environmental changes without constant human intervention. The findings were published this week in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence. Humans are one of a select few species of animals that have evolved to recognize our reflection and learn from it. Young children acknowledge their bizarre new bodies in mirrors or ponds, take notes about what they are seeing, and create a \u201cmental model\u201d of themselves in 3D space. That observation can help the development of movement, coordination, and early language skills. This process, which the researchers call \u201cself-simulation\u201d doesn\u2019t just apply to children either. Dancers also regularly analyze their own reflections to correct their placement and receive instant visual feedback. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For this study, the researchers wanted to see if they could find a way to apply a similar self-simulation process to an autonomous robot. Normally, roboticists train AI models powering robots in highly detailed and curated virtual simulations. It\u2019s only after copious rounds of training are complete that a model is typically then applied to a physical machine. But that process is limiting in multiple ways. For starters, advanced simulations can take a long time to perfect and often require extensive engineering expertise. They are also somewhat restrained in terms of adaptability. If something unexpected happens to the robot in a physical world that\u2019s outside of the parameters it was trained on in simulation, it might have trouble properly responding. \u201cOur goal is a robot that understands its own body, adapts to damage, and learns new skills without constant human programming,\u201d Columbia University doctoral student and paper lead author Yuhang Hu said in a statement. To do that, the researchers developed a new \u201cself-supervised learning framework\u201d consisting of three separate deep neural networks. A coordinate encoder first processes a raw video of the robot captured by a single camera, a process the researchers liken to a human looking at themselves in a mirror. A kinematic encoder then converts that image\u2014which includes data highlighting the robot\u2019s joints and other areas of movement\u2014into a binary image. Finally, the predictive model completes the process by instructing the physical robot arm on how to move in the real world. The result is a robot that can continuously adjust its movements based on video data from a camera rather than relying on a virtual training simulation. The researchers tested their new learning framework by putting their robot arm through a few basic tasks. First, they demonstrated that the arm could avoid an obstacle (in this case, a cardboard-like divider) simply by watching a video frame of itself successfully swinging past the barrier. More interestingly, they also showed how the same model could help the robot adapt to damage. Researchers wanted to see how the robot would respond in a hypothetical scenario where an overly heavy load bent its limb. To test this, they 3D-printed a damaged limb and attached it to the robot. After watching a video of itself with the new arm, the model was able to refine its predictions and adjust the robot\u2019s movements to compensate for the simulated damage. \u201cOur results demonstrate that this self-learned simulation not only enables accurate motion planning but also allows the robot to detect abnormalities and recover from damage,\u201d the researchers wrote in a preprint version of the paper. The self-simulation method demonstrated in the paper could help improve a wide range of future autonomous robots that may one day be deployed for various tasks, from manufacturing work to environmental and industrial monitoring. The ability of these robots to learn from camera data and even adapt to damage could reduce downtime and prevent human repair workers from being unnecessarily exposed to potentially hazardous conditions. Self-repairing capabilities could become even more important in areas like robot-assisted elder and child care, where damage to the machines could have an immediate impact on a person\u2019s well-being. There are also more mundane advantages to this approach. The researchers note that a self-repairing vacuum robot, for instance, could theoretically use these techniques to adjust its movement after noticing it had bumped into a wall and knocked a limb slightly out of place. In other worlds, clumsy Roombas barreling through cluttered apartments might one day stand\u00a0 more of a fighting chance. \u201cWe humans cannot afford to constantly baby these robots, repair broken parts and adjust performance,\u201d Columbia Professor and paper co-author Hod Lipson said. \u201cRobots need to learn to take care of themselves.\u201d Contributor Mack DeGeurin is a tech reporter who\u2019s spent years investigating where technology and politics collide.

        "title": "US Fish and Wildlife is begging you to eat more invasive marsh rodents | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 25, 2025 The US Fish and Wildlife Service is asking Americans to step up as conservationists and make a meal out of cat-sized rodents. The plea is part of the agency\u2019s annual National Invasive Species Week (February 24-28), which highlights the numerous non-native animals wreaking havoc on local ecosystems across the country. Experts in this case are particularly focused on nutria\u2014an herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal that looks like a cross between a giant rat and a beaver. \u201cPlease consider the following slogan \u2018Save a Swamp, Saut\u00e9 a Nutria,\u2019\u201d the agency suggested in a Facebook post on Monday. Nutria are native to South America, but were first brought to Louisiana in the 1930\u2019s to help meet fur industry demands. By the early 1940\u2019s, hurricane damage to nutria farms accidentally allowed the voracious and rapidly reproducing animals to escape into the wild, where females average two litters of pups per year. A single adult nutria can weigh as much as 20 lbs, and is capable of consuming its own weight in vegetation every day, year-round. Prior to concerted mitigation efforts, nutria were estimated to annually devour as much as 90,000 acres\u2019 worth of coastal wetlands. The scope of their damage can affect everything from flood patterns, to agriculture, to public health. Thanks to decades of conservation campaigns (and $6-per-tail hunting season bounties), damage estimates dropped down to around 5,500 acres in 2024, but nutria continue to pose a problem if populations are left unchecked. Today, the rodents are also causing trouble along the Atlantic coast and in portions of California. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While rodents aren\u2019t a staple on many US dinner plates, nutria can be prepared a number of different ways depending on one\u2019s preference. Unsure of how to properly prepare nutria for your next meal? The US Fish and Wildlife Service has two words for you: nutria gumbo. \u201cTheir meat is lean, mild, and tastes like rabbit,\u201d they write. There are even entire cookbooks dedicated to nutria-based dishes. Nutria for Home Use, released in 1963, included recipes not only for gumbo, but \u201cmacaroni-nutria casserole\u201d and \u201cnutria chop suey.\u201d Like any wild game, however, it\u2019s important to prepare the meat properly to avoid contamination. It\u2019s also still necessary to check up on local hunting regulations to ensure you\u2019re collecting them legally. But if the thought of \u201cnutria-bacon rolls\u201d doesn\u2019t sound appetizing, National Invasive Species Week also highlights plenty of other options for the dedicated conservationist: the northern snakehead fish, invasive carp, feral hogs, and even green iguanas.

        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 25, 2025 There are thousands of officially registered Scottish tartan designs, but only one is dedicated to the \u201cwitches\u201d of Scotland. Certified earlier this month, the tricolor pattern is intended as a memorial honoring the thousands of women who were falsely accused of witchcraft during the 16th through 18th centuries. Most of the victims were hanged following sham trials and unjust convictions. Following their executions, their bodies were also burned and denied proper burial. Accusations of witchcraft have offered a convenient way to subjugate and silence persecuted people for centuries. In Europe, this frequently also stemmed from a growing stigmatization of folk medicine and midwifery, practices most often associated with women. \u00a0 The most recognizable example in the United States is the Salem Witch Trials of 1692-1693. Over 200 people were accused, resulting in19 hangings\u2013including 14 women. In Scotland, however, the Witchcraft Act of 1563 remained codified law for nearly 200 years, and helped justify the deaths of thousands of people. Witches of Scotland, an advocacy group campaigning for a formal governmental pardon and the construction of a national memorial, estimates around 84 percent of those cases centered on women. But while the organization secured an apology from then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in 2022, an official pardon and historic monument plans remain elusive. In the meantime, Witches of Scotland co-founder Claire Mitchell thought of another way to commemorate the Witchcraft Act\u2019s many victims. In collaboration with designer Clare Campbell, Mitchell created a new tartan whose tricolor scheme, weaving, and patterns all directly recall the Scottish witchcraft trials. Speaking with The Herald, Mitchell explained that the red threads represent the victims\u2019 blood, the gray serves as a reminder of the ashes left after authorities burned their bodies, while the pink mimics the color of the tape used to tie legal documents. Each black square contains 173 threads for every year the Witchcraft Act was enforced, while the thin lines have either 15 or 17 threads\u201415 is the sum of the digits of the year the Witchcraft Act was passed (1+5+6+3), and 17 for when it was repealed (1+7+3+6).

Mitchell and Campbell expect their Witches of Scotland kilts to launch in May. However, unlike other tartan patterns, wearers aren\u2019t restricted to a specific family or clan. Anyone can sport the pattern in support of the unjustly persecuted and vulnerable populations, both then and now. Andrew Paul is Popular Science\u2019s staff writer covering tech news.

        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted on Feb 25, 2025 Why did prehistoric people on the Iberian Peninsula sever the heads of some of their dead and put iron nails in their skulls? This question has been debated by archaeologists for years and we finally have some new clues. The nailed head ritual may have been as a way to intimidate their enemies and celebrate their ancestors. The findings published in the April 2025 issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports show that the practice differed in each settlement. It also offers direct evidence of how these Iron Age populations moved around the northeastern Iberian Peninsula\u2013modern Spain and Portugal. Severed heads like these were a unique funerary practice within the Iron Age Iberian world. For archaeologists and anthropologists, they offer a way to analyze these prehistoric communities. Most bodies were cremated at this time, so there is very little evidence of death rituals in the archaeological record. After death, iron nails were placed into the skulls of certain individuals. The skulls were then put out on exhibition for all to see. Archaeologists have recovered some of these skulls with signs of nailing and in some cases with the nail still embedded into the skull. Over time, archaeologists have debated if these skulls were war trophies, relics of important members of the community, or something else. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The male skulls were uncovered in two archaeological sites that date back to this period of the Iron Age\u2013Ullastret (about 84 miles north of Barcelona) and a settlement called Puig Castellar. The sites are roughly 60 miles apart and both hosted ancient cities that were abandoned when the Romans arrived towards the end of the third century BCE. \u201cOur results reveal that the individuals from Puig Castellar and Ullastret would not have been randomly selected,\u201d said de la Fuente-Seoane. \u201cThere would have been a homogeneous trend towards men in these rituals. However, the mobility and localisation patterns suggest a greater diversity, which could also imply social and cultural differences among the individuals of the two communities.\u201d [ Related: Medieval child \u2018vampire burial\u2019 exhumed near Polish cathedral. ] To take a more in-depth look at the skulls, the team combined bioarchaeology techniques and isotope analysis. They looked at the strontium and oxygen isotopes in the dental enamel recovered from the skulls, which can reveal details about the individual\u2019s diet. The team also took detailed samples of the sediment and vegetation collected near the sites to reference it with the data uncovered from the tooth enamel. This can tell scientists whether the food they ate was grown locally or further away and offers an educated guess at where the individuals were from. The analysis revealed that three of the four individuals found at Puig Castellar were likely not from the community. Ullastret had a mixture of non-local and local groups. \u201cThis result suggests that the practice of severed heads was applied in a different way at each site, which seems to rule out a homogeneous symbolic expression. But more research is needed to be sure,\u201d said de la Fuente-Seoane. According to the team, the fact that the Puig Castellar skulls were exposed in an area like a wall leads them to believe that they were displayed as a demonstration of power and coercion. This could have been for both internal repression and towards some group of outsiders. In Ullastret, the two local individuals were found in a street in the middle of the city. This suggests that they put on display on a wall or a doorway of the houses next to it. This supports the hypothesis that the skulls belonged to important community members. A third Ullastret skull\u2013potentailly of foreign origin\u2013was found in one of the external walls of the settlement. The team believes that this could represent a war trophy. The study shows some direct evidence of how prehistoric humans moved around the northeastern Iberian Peninsula during the Iron Age. It also offers some new perspectives on the territoriality in the region. Earlier studies suggested that there were major differences in how these societies used and exploited the resources surrounding them. The team from this study was able to use the Puig Castellar and Ullastret skulls to show different mobility patterns and values. The vegetation samples also show different resource management practices at each site. \u201cThis differentiation reflects a dynamic and complex society with important local and external interactions,\u201d said de la Fuente-Seoane. \u201cOur study is a first approach to this archaeological problem using a method that is revolutionising the way we study mobility in the past. At the same time, it suggests that the selection of individuals for the severed heads ritual was more complex than initially thought.\u201d Laura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she is particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology, nanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.

        "title": "Why is Mars red? Our old understanding might be wrong. | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted on Feb 25, 2025 The color red and the planet Mars go together like Earth and its oceans or Saturn and its rings. However, our understanding of how the Red Planet got its signature hue might be wrong. A new hypothesis focusing on ferrihydrite is detailed in a study published February 25 in the journal Nature Communications. The ferrihydrite might have formed back when there was still water on the planet\u2013potentially when it was habitable. In the decades that astronomers have been studying Mars, we\u2019ve learned that its distinct color comes from rusted iron minerals in the dust that covers the planet. At some point in the Red Planet\u2019s 4.5 to 4.6 billion year history, the iron bound up in its rocks reacted with water and oxygen in the air, similar to how rust forms here on Earth. The resulting iron oxide was then broken down into dust and was spread around the planet by winds. However, iron oxides come in different varieties. Astronomers have debated the exact chemistry of Martian rust for years. Figuring out how this rust forms is a crucial window into Mars\u2019 environmental conditions at the time of rusting. Closely linked to that environmental question is whether Mars has ever been habitable. Earlier studies of the iron oxide component in Martian dust that were based on spacecraft observations alone did not find any evidence of water within it. This led researchers to conclude that this particular type of iron oxide must be a mineral called hematite. [ Related: Europe\u2019s first Mars rover will use nuclear-powered heaters. ] This new analysis combining spacecraft observations with some newly developed laboratory techniques shows that Mars\u2019 red color is better matched by iron oxides containing water\u2013known as ferrihydrite\u2013and not hematite. Ferrihydrite typically forms quickly around cool water, which means it must have formed when Mars still had water on its surface. The ferrihydrite has kept this watery signature to the present day, despite being constantly ground down and spread around the planet for billions of years. While trying to create a replica of martian dust in the lab with different types of iron oxide, the team from this study was in for a surprise. \u201cWe found that ferrihydrite mixed with basalt, a volcanic rock, best fits the minerals seen by spacecraft at Mars,\u201d Adomas Valantinas, a study co-author and postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, said in a statement. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While Mars is still undoubtedly the Red Planet, this new finding changes our understanding of why it is red. \u201cThe major implication is that because ferrihydrite could only have formed when water was still present on the surface, Mars rusted earlier than we previously thought,\u201d said Valantinas. \u201cMoreover, the ferrihydrite remains stable under present-day conditions on Mars.\u201d Previous studies have suggested that ferrihydrite might be present in martian dust, but this research offers some of the first comprehensive proof with a unique combination of space mission data and lab-based experiments. In the study, they used an advanced grinder machine to create a realistic replica of the martian dust. The grinder can create a dust grain equivalent to the size of 1/100th of a human hair. The team then analyzed the samples using the same techniques that orbiting spacecraft will use in order to make a direct comparison. This pinpointed ferrihydrite as the best match. \u201cThis study is the result of the complementary datasets from the fleet of international missions exploring Mars from orbit and at ground level,\u201d Colin Wilson, the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express project scientist, said in a statement. Mars Express\u2019 analysis of the dust\u2019s mineralogy helped show how even highly dusty regions of Mars have water-rich minerals. Additionally, TGO\u2019s unique orbit allows it to view the same region under different lighting and angles. This allowed the team to disentangle particle size and composition, which proved essential for recreating the correct dust size in the lab. Other data from NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ground-based measurements taken by NASA Mars rovers Curiosity, Pathfinder, and Opportunity, also helped make the case for ferrihydrite. \u201cWe eagerly await the results from upcoming missions like ESA\u2019s Rosalind Franklin rover and the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return, which will allow us to probe deeper into what makes Mars red,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cSome of the samples already collected by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover and awaiting return to Earth include dust; once we get these precious samples into the lab, we\u2019ll be able to measure exactly how much ferrihydrite the dust contains, and what this means for our understanding of the history of water\u2013and the possibility for life\u2013on Mars.\u201d However, the samples from Perseverance are not expected to make it back to Earth until 2040, pushed back from the original target of 2031. So for now, we will still be debating just how Mars got so red.

        "title": "The best headphones for working out in 2025, tested and reviewed | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Julian Vittorio, Stan Horaczek Updated on Feb 25, 2025 We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more \u203a Using headphones for working out can transform your frame of reference and put you in the mood to grind like nothing else. Of course, exercise can be strenuous and involve tons of movement, so it\u2019s essential to find a pair that leaves you unencumbered by wires and fit securely enough that they won\u2019t be flung to the ground every time you move your head. In this list, we\u2019ll break down the best headphones for working out\u2014like our best overall, the Apple Beats Fit Pro\u2014and optimizing the circuit(s) with your favorite music and podcasts. The best headphones for working out are wireless, and Bluetooth requires power. And, in all honesty, the best headphones for working out are earphones, which is why they make up the majority of our selections. We picked pairs that offer at least five hours of single-charge battery life, and all of the earbuds include charging cases. Considering the battery life of your audio device is extremely important for keeping the flow going\u2014you wouldn\u2019t want the music to stop mid-workout. All of the selections on our list fit securely around the head or in the ear to ensure that they move very little or not at all during workouts. Everyday headphones made for walking or when you\u2019re stationary aren\u2019t typically designed with extreme movement in mind. Sound quality was also a big factor in considering headphones for this list, and many of the earbuds we picked either come with a full and balanced sound profile or offer the option to adjust their sound via an app.\u00a0Staying aware of the activity around you is always important while wearing headphones, especially if you\u2019re on the go. For our list, we picked headphones/earphones that either feature a transparency mode or are completely open-ear. Prepping for a workout is all about getting your mind and body in the right place, and apart from stretching, putting on the right clothes, and making sure you have a favorite water bottle and your fitness tracker, pumping up the jams properly can pump you up for a regular training run. One of our choices is sure to put a spring in your step the next time you go for a jog or lift weights. Why it made the cut: The Apple Beats Fit Pro features a snug fit, balanced sound, and seamless iOS connectivity that make them easy to add to any workout routine. Specs We\u2019ve thoroughly reviewed the Apple Beats Fit Pro, and they take the best overall award on this list thanks to their sound quality, workout-friendly design, and fantastic iOS compatibility. They contain the same proprietary H1 chip found in Apple\u2019s AirPods, which enables near-instantaneous pairing and steady, reliable connections to iOS devices along with battery life optimization. Like AirPods, the Beats Fit Pro earbuds are also fully compatible with iOS head-tracking and spatial audio features for simulated surround sound and immersive media listening. Their inclusion of active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency modes make them equally useful on the road and at the gym. We also love the range of colors these buds come in. The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are designed to sit securely in your ears using small rubber wings that rest comfortably against your outer ear along with three sets of variously sized ear tips. A quick optional setup step uses the earbuds\u2019 onboard microphones to test your fit for sound leaks. Once your optimal fit is achieved, the Beats Fit Pro can endure almost every exercise imaginable, including rowing, without budging. They\u2019re some of the best running headphones around. The earbuds\u2019 conveniently pocked-sized charging case brings their total battery life to around 24 hours. While it would be nice to see wireless charging in a product with this price tag, we appreciate that the case is chargeable via USB-C rather than Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning connector. While the Beats Fit Pro earbuds are unmistakably great for iPhone users, it\u2019s unfortunate that the instant pairing and steady connectivity of the earbuds\u2019 H1 chip aren\u2019t extended to Android users. For their price, it would also be nice to see features like multipoint pairing and more robust weatherproofing rather than the same IPX4 rating found in standard AirPods. Still, if you work out regularly and are an iPhone user, you\u2019d be seriously hard-pressed to find a better in-ear option. If you\u2019re sold on the Beats features but are looking for an option with earhooks, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds below are a solid choice. Stan Horaczek Why it made the cut: With built-in ear hooks and five different tip sizes, these high-end buds fit perfectly and stay in no matter what kind of workout you\u2019re doing. Specs When it comes to earbuds, nothing keeps them in place during a workout better than a full-on hook. Thanks to that form factor, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds reach over the back of the ear and lock in place for your workout. I had some of my fittest friends try them during exercises like burpees and pull-ups and no one could shake them loose (though they did get them very sweaty). The box includes five different tip sizes from which a hearing test helps you choose the right one for your specific ear holes. From a sound performance standpoint, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds offer many of the same qualities found in the AirPods Pro 2. You get active noise canceling, which works very well in most settings. Transparency mode, on the other hand, allows sound to come in from the outside world. That\u2019s important if you\u2019re working out in public or running on a road. The transparency isn\u2019t quite as effective as an open-back or bone-conduction option that doesn\u2019t obstruct the ear canal at all (for those, see below), but it\u2019s a closer battle than it seems. The onboard media controls rely on physical buttons, which are easier to press than touch-based controls during exercise. They can trigger some accidental inputs, though, until you get used to putting them in without accidentally hitting a button. Despite a few quirks, these are S-tier workout earbuds. They sound great. They fit impeccably. And the case isn\u2019t quite as chunky as the previous model, which felt like carrying a plastic Uncrustable around in your pocket. ely light, comfy option with IPX4 and a long battery life that makes them great for taking on a run. Tony Ware Why it made the cut: The unique design of the SHOKZ OpenRun 2 keeps your ears fully open so that you can stay aware of your surroundings and your motivating sounds. Specs The SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 is an open-ear headphones that sports a unique design that allows you to listen to music and podcasts while maintaining full situational awareness. Unlike traditional headphone designs, bone-conduction headphones employ a clever hack of human anatomy to transfer sounds directly to the inner ear by gently vibrating your facial bones from the outside in, leaving the entire ear canal unobstructed. The typical drawbacks to this design include that they provide no passive or active noise cancellation, and the vibrations may be audible to others, so they\u2019re not the best choice for quiet environments or taking public transit. Bone-conduction headphones also produce markedly less bass frequencies than traditional designs, making them less ideal for immersive music listening. However, the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 addresses this with a dual-driver setup it calls DualPitch\u2014using bone-conduction on your temples for the highs and air-conduction (aka an 18mmx11mm racetrack woofer) pointed into the ear for the lows. On the functionality side of things, the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 packs about 12 hours of battery life on a single charge (now via USB-C for cord convenience) and boasts a substantial IP55 rating\u2014protected from dust and water but not impervious, so don\u2019t submerge them (the company makes the OpenSwim Pro for that). They have a comfy 30g Ni-Ti headband design with easy-to-use control buttons that make them particularly suited for running and cycling in traffic. The end result is a set that is pretty comfortable, even if you have a helmet, wear a snood, or have a ponytail. You\u2019re not going to be bumping massive bass, but you can hear the beat and your surroundings. These aren\u2019t for you if you want to be drowning in music, but they\u2019re great if you want to keep an ear out for traffic. And you don\u2019t have to worry about them flying off if you hit a bump or turn your head really fast (a genuine traditional earbud issue). Oh, and Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint pairing lets you use them at a computer and easily pick up where you left off on your phone when it\u2019s time to leave the house and hit the trails. Specs It may come as a surprise that Bose, so well-known for industry-leading noise cancellation that shuts the world out, is also responsible for earbuds on this list that are purpose-built to do the exact opposite. Its new Ultra Open Earbuds have a unique design; instead of inserting buds into your ear canal, you wrap it cuff-like around the helix (the edge) of your ear, then settle the speaker end into the concha right above the ear canal. This lets the earbud play into your ear while leaving it exposed to outside noise, which is practical when running or biking or when you need to hear an instructor\u2019s directions/motivation. You\u2019ll be able to hear obstacles like cars or other runners/cyclists coming behind you. And, unlike with bone-conduction headphones, there is ample bass response and a convincing Immersive Audio mode, so the sound appears far more outside your head. Getting the hang of how to properly wear the Ultra Open Earbuds takes a couple of tries. The buds are very flexible as you clip them on. This curled design ensures they can fit behind virtually any sized ear comfortably. There\u2019s no worrying about which eartips will create a proper seal or whether they\u2019ll fall out of your ear, which allows you to grab and go and focus on whatever you\u2019re listening to or doing with your body. Once settled, the control buttons sit atop the body held securely behind the ear, allowing you push patterns to pause/play, skip/repeat a track, answer calls, toggle the Immersion mode, and adjust volume. And the polished exterior doesn\u2019t interfere with the style or fit of your jewelry, glasses, hats, etc. They grip snugly around our ears even during jogs without indicating they\u2019d slip or fall off. That said, it never felt like the earbuds were pinching our ears or irritating them in any other way. Musically, Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds are a great addition to the company\u2019s lineup. They support Bluetooth 5.3 (including AAC for iPhones) and, surprisingly, delivered a lot of bass, which we didn\u2019t think would be possible from earbuds that created no seal around our ears. Perhaps even more surprisingly, there was very little sound bleed; the directional drivers do an excellent job of beaming sound into the canal so that you could feel comfortable wearing these without worrying about disturbing someone doing their set next to you. But really where they excel is when you\u2019re actively exercising outdoors and want to enjoy that perfect playlist without sacrificing safety. Why it made the cut: The Anker Soundcore Sport X10 offers an incredibly secure fit and long battery life for runners on a budget. Specs If you\u2019re less concerned about noise cancellation performance, the Anker Soundcore Sport X10s are a great budget option for working out thanks to their secure fit and long battery life. They have a unique swiveling ear hook design that folds into a compact shape for storage in their charging case and unfolds to loop securely around the front of your earlobe, keeping them snug during even the most vigorous exercise routines. The Sport X10s also features a six-microphone array that provides relatively good phone call quality and an effective transparency mode. Still, their ANC performance falls short of quieting most common midrange sounds like speech, engines, and other urban noise. The Sport X10\u2019s sound profile is a bit muddy and heavy in the low-mids, but this can be adjusted using the EQ settings within the Soundcore app, which includes several presets to choose from. The app also allows you to rebind custom functions to the earbuds\u2019 onboard control buttons, which are clicky and provide some nice feedback but tend to shift the earbud around with minor discomfort. You also don\u2019t get multipoint pairing with the Sport X10, but at their price point, that\u2019s understandable. You could take the best headphones to the gym, but you would probably have very sweaty ears and potentially ruin your precious investment. Heck, even some of the best Bluetooth earbuds might not be suited for more than a brisk stroll. So here is what to think about before clicking \u201cadd to cart\u201d on the best headphones for working out and going all in on that next set: Sweating is a normal part of any workout, but if you tend to sweat more than the average person while you exercise, you should consider a pair of headphones with an Ingress Protection rating of IPX7. Most of the headphones on our list are designed with at least IP55 level of sweatproofing. If you sweat a lot, you\u2019ll probably also want to steer clear of over-ear designs, which can heat up your ears and exacerbate the problem (plus they\u2019re less secure and less durable in general when it comes to high-output exercise). If you do CrossFit or other forms of intense workouts, choose earbuds that use an ear hook or another type of external fastener to ensure that they don\u2019t go flying. We like the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds for heavy exertion, though the soundcore by Anker Sport X10 is an inexpensive alternative. If you use your headphones frequently, have limited access to charging capabilities, or just find yourself constantly running devices on low battery, picking a set of headphones with a high battery capacity can increase the likelihood that they\u2019ll be ready come workout time. The 10-hour single charge (45 hours with charging case) of the Apple Powerbeats Pro 2 is the best we\u2019ve tested in the battery life department, though our budget pick, the soundcore by Anker Sport X10, also performs well. If you spend lots of time exercising near traffic or in busy locations, it\u2019s important to maintain a good level of situational awareness for your own safety. Many headphones include a transparency mode that allows you to hear your surroundings in addition to your music, including the Apple Beats Fit Pro. For maximum situational awareness, nothing beats the open-ear design of bone-conduction headphones, and we prefer the SHOKZ OpenRun. Headphones for working out cost between $70 and $200, depending on features. It\u2019s generally OK to sweat with headphones as long as they were designed with some measure of waterproofing. The easiest way to tell if your headphones are waterproof is by looking for an IP rating in their specs\u2014anything above IPX4 should be just fine for everyday workouts. If you sweat a bit more than average, choosing something around IPX7 or higher might be safer. All of the picks on our list, except for the JBL Live 670NC, are water-resistant to fully waterproof. Bone conduction headphones are very good for working out thanks to their open-ear design that keeps you fully in touch with your surroundings. Runners and cyclists are particularly good candidates for using bone-conduction headphones due to their proximity to road traffic, though anyone can benefit from the increased situational awareness that these designs provide. Noise-canceling headphones work in the gym to an extent, but not every pair of ANC headphones is created equal. The best headphones for canceling out human conversation and ambient music that we\u2019ve tested include the Apple Beats Fit Pro, aided by a secure earplug design to deliver passive and active noise canceling at the same time. The best headphones for working out will fit securely in your ears or on your head while delivering great sound and a good level of situational awareness. We love the Apple Beats Fit Pro for its overall sound quality and secure fit. If you need the longest and most reliable battery performance, the Powerbeats Pro 2 and JBL 670NC are the best earbuds and over-ears for working out, respectively. And if you want the best situational awareness possible while cycling and running, the SHOKZ OpenRun Pro 2 bone conduction headphones and the surprisingly immersive Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have our vote.

Learn more \u203a Getting a cup of coffee from any shop has gotten absurdly expensive, which means a Nespresso machine will pay for itself in no time. Espresso drinks can be customized to fit your day and mood. A double espresso preps for a day that\u2019s all business, no frills. A latte with skim milk offers comfort without adding too much to a waistline. An affogato is an adventure in a cup, and if you start your day like this, you\u2019re probably a party. These home appliances can create all of them without extensive barista training. The capsule-based system automates many coffee-based drinks into a one-button operation or a selection from a menu. We combed through popular models, examining the variety of drinks they make, the types of accessories they take, and their ease of use to determine the best Nespresso machines for every type of caffeine capsule connoisseur. We\u2019ve declared the Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville the best overall Nespresso machine, but keep reading to find the machine that best fits your taste, lifestyle, and budget. We\u2019re the kind of people who get caffeine headaches if we miss our morning cuppa \u2026 and our afternoon follow-up. We\u2019ve been perfecting our home setups for years, experimenting with different coffeemakers for our own consumption and for reviews. And we love to give coffee gifts to coffee lovers. Our recommendations come from this accumulated experience, expert opinions, and research. Nespresso machines are best for people who like their coffee on the more robust, darker side and want a machine to do most of the work. Compared to the grinding, tamping, and pulling of a traditional espresso machine, Nespresso machines brew quickly and comparatively cleanly. The flavor is also remarkably consistent\u2014it\u2019s one of the selling points (too consistent across pods, some say, but to each their own). To pick the suitable machine for your home, determine whether you want coffee, espresso, or milk-based drinks; consider the size of used capsule containers and water tanks; and how easy it is to operate and clean. If the slower, more customizable route is your speed, check out our picks for the best espresso machines. But if you love the idea of one-touch pick-me-ups or even some lite steam pipe experimentation, get that coffee travel mug ready and read on. Specs The Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville offers one-button simplicity for households that want espresso and coffee. The machine can brew a single or double espresso, lungo, and 8-ounce coffee, but it reads the capsule for the brewing specs, including coffee size, temperature, pressure, and brewing time. In other words, you don\u2019t customize your drink with buttons; you select its main features according to whatever Vertuo capsule volumes and flavors you bought.\u00a0 The expansive capsule menu includes single-origin options, flavors like pumpkin spice cake, and iced options that brew with intense flavor. Brewing is as simple as selecting a capsule, pressing a button, and waiting. When complete, the capsule automatically drops into the used capsule container. The Deluxe model comes with one of the larger used capsule containers and a 60-ounce water tank, so you won\u2019t have to empty or refill the machine after each drink. Water tank placement is also adjustable; it can be moved behind or kept on the side to adjust for shallow counters or weird corners. It\u2019s an excellent machine for someone who wants simplicity and to clean up after a few cups, not each one. However, some users complain about the water tank developing leaks after years of use. Specs The Instant Pod 3-in-1 Espresso, K-Cup Pod and Ground Coffee Maker is for the household that insists on having many coffee options in a single machine. And this bad boy is the only machine that brews from Nespresso Original capsules, Keurig cups, and, yes, even your own beans of choice with an included reusable pod. The multitasking machine comes from the makers of the Instant Pot multicooker, though this kitchen gadget doesn\u2019t seem to have a cult following\u2014yet. Like other entry-level Nespresso machines, the Instant Pod\u2019s suggested retail runs around $180, and it can crank out a single espresso, a double espresso, or a lungo. However, it offers the flexibility of three more sizes\u20148, 10, and 12 ounces\u2014for Keurig cups and your own grounds without having another machine on your counter. There\u2019s also an option to brew \u201cbold\u201d for putting it over ice. It\u2019s the most flexible machine for coffee and espresso drinkers, especially if Nespresso\u2019s signature crema on its regular coffee is too bitter. The boxy, all-plastic body gives water cooler vibes minus the water bottle. Still, it does have a massive 68-ounce water tank that will take a reasonable amount of time before a refill is needed, particularly when brewing cup by cup. Some users warn that its height and flip-top-style lid can be too tall for some upper cabinets, so measure carefully. Specs The Nespresso Essenza Mini by De\u2019Longhi is teeny tiny by coffee machine standards but is big on simplicity. It warms up in under 30 seconds, switches to a low power mode after three minutes, and automatically turns off after nine. The Essenza Mini features only two buttons, making either a single espresso or a nearly 4-ounce lungo using Nespresso Original line capsules. If you prefer a different volume, you can program each of the two buttons, but this isn\u2019t a machine for someone who wants a Stanley mug to sip out of all day. The machine, which comes in black or red, is small enough to tuck away, though it\u2019s cute enough to stay full-time on the counter. At under three pounds, some customers report packing it up for trips or using it in RVs.To make milk-based drinks, you can upgrade it to a bundle with an Aerocinno or check out our recommended milk frothers. Specs Latte lovers, the Nespresso Gran Lattissima Original Espresso Machine by De\u2019Longhi is for you. The Gran Lattissima\u2019s glass screen features buttons for nine different coffee drinks, including milk-based options such as cappuccino, latte macchiato, cafe latte, flat white, or just hot milk or hot foam. It doesn\u2019t whip up lovely latte art, but the milk drinks are consistent and, most of all, easy. Like many options on this list, the machine warms up in 25 seconds. Most Nespresso makers are noisy when brewing and the Gran Lattissima\u2019s adds the glugging and chugging of milk as it foams, which is something to consider if you\u2019re an early bird in close quarters with sleeping night owls. The milk carafe needs a little TLC after every use. The brewing is easy: Attach it for any drink that requires milk, and the machine will follow the \u201crecipe\u201d for each selection as needed. The Gran Lattissima will handle the recipe. It\u2019s the clean-up that takes practice to get the sequence right. When your drink is finished, the machine will prompt you to clean it. Swap your crafted beverage with an empty, easy-to-clean cup\u2014which it doesn\u2019t come with. Switch the milk carafe\u2019s dial to \u201cclean,\u201d water will push through the tubes and connections to prevent buildup. Don\u2019t skip this step, and don\u2019t just clean it into the drip tray because the milky water will go here, there, everywhere, and you\u2019ll end up wiping it down anyway and emptying a drip tray. The versatility comes with a higher price tag of over $600, so the all-plastic body is disappointing. However, the sleek, monotone black or white machines look chic on the counter. A few more design-minded customers think the all-white model should also have an all-white power cord (the black ruins the look). Specs The Breville Nespresso The Creatista Pro goes all in on its espresso machine heritage with a gleaming, stainless steel body complete with a steam wand, making the Nespresso the best with milk frother. It looks intimidating, but the Creatista Pro keeps most of the process automated while expanding the variety of drinks you can make at home. The glass touchscreen scrolls through black drinks\u2014your espressos, ristrettos, etc.\u2014as well as milk-based beverages. Each of the nine preset drinks allows for custom adjustments, like tweaking the coffee volume and adjusting the milk temperatures and froth levels. And once you develop your most perfect, individualized drink, you can save it to the menu. You expect this level of customization for more than $800, but the Creatista Pro has additional finer touches to enjoy. The machine warms up in three seconds, brewing the coffee into one vessel as it foams the milk in an included stainless steel milk jug. When finished, the steam wand has an auto-purge feature, but you\u2019ll still need to wipe it with a damp cloth. The Pro also has a dedicated hot water spout to keep a clean, coffee-free taste when making an Americano or its Australian cousin, a long black, or simply pre-warming a mug. The stainless-steel body and accessories must be hand wiped and washed more than other Nespresso machines. Nothing\u2019s going into the dishwasher, and you should avoid abrasive cleaners. It\u2019s a splurge but a gorgeous piece of counter art for an aspiring barista or perhaps one who wants to leave the thinking to a machine while they\u2019re at home. Either way, you can practice latte art with the little jug. That part isn\u2019t automated. A shocking lot is standardized in Nespresso machines. They\u2019re generally co-branded by Breville or De\u2019Longhi, and they all put precisely the same amount of pressure\u201419 bars\u2014into a shot. They warm up in less than 30 seconds, with higher-end models doing it even faster. They all roar as they push water through the capsule. The rest looks at price points, style, and how many other drinks you want to make beyond a single espresso. Except for the Instant Pod, Nespresso machines are a commitment to capsules, capsules, and only capsules. Nespresso offers two lines\u2014Original and Vertuo\u2014that are not interchangeable. Espresso drinkers should consider the Original line, which focuses on a less than 1-ounce ristretto, espresso, and lungo, only getting mug-size beverage when adding milk for cappuccinos and lattes or making a bunch of espresso shots. The Vertuo line suits people who go back and forth between espresso and coffee. The coffee, however, differs from a traditional brewed cup of joe. Coffee made by a Nespresso machine features a thick layer of crema that a pour-over or a drip coffee doesn\u2019t have. Some love the dark foam, while others find it bitter in a bad way. All Nespresso machines will make one cup at a time, and they\u2019ll use either an Original or Vertuo capsule but can take up wildly different amounts of space. The simple Essenza Mini takes up less than half the area of the eye-catching Creatista Pro, and consider how much space you\u2019ll need for any other accessories, like capsule displays or milk frothers. Many of the Nespresso makers in this roundup come in multiple colors to blend or pop your decor. A big part of a Nespresso\u2019s price tag depends on whether a milk frothing component is an accessory or built-in. If lattes and cappuccinos are \u201cnice to have,\u201d opt for a simpler Nespresso and save some cash. You can always accessorize with a standalone milk frother later. However, if lattes and cappuccinos are a \u201cmust-have,\u201d choose a model designed for milk drinks and muse on how much customization you want. Depending on water hardness and use, Nespresso machines will periodically signal when they need a descaling and walk you through the process. Many other cleanings are automated\u2014like post-drink rinsing for milk carafes\u2014though other parts like drip trays, used capsule containers, and water tanks should also be washed out. Check to see if models have dishwasher-compatible components. By definition of an espresso\u2019s water temperature, water pressure, and other specs like that, no, a Nespresso is not an espresso. A Nespresso-made espresso drink isn\u2019t as thick as a traditionally crafted, hand-pulled espresso drink. It\u2019s darn close, though; if you had to ask, it\u2019s probably close enough for you, too. If you want to dissect the issue, coffee discussion boards and Reddit threads are ready. Nespresso offers various capsules with different flavors and intensities in its Original and Vertuo lines. However, other third parties make capsules, including Williams-Sonoma, Peet\u2019s, Starbucks, Illy, etc. The Original line tends to be more available than the Vertuo line. Nespresso will recycle the aluminum-encased capsules with prepaid recycling envelopes that you can get online or at a boutique. Select locations, including Nespresso boutiques, and some Williams-Sonoma or Sur La Table locations, also take used capsules. Check the Nespresso site for the latest information. Anyone looking to mix up their morning coffee routine with some variety can make consistently good drinks with a Nespresso machine. Our pick for best overall machine\u2014the Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville\u2014creates a range of hot and cold coffee and espresso drinks. The tiny Nespresso Essenza Mini by De\u2019Longhi does espresso with a singular purpose while the Instant Pod pulls triple duty by brewing from Nespresso capsules, Keurig cups, and grinds of your choice. Fans of milk-based brews have two excellent options: Nespresso Gran Lattissima Original Espresso Machine by De\u2019Longhi for an automated experience or the Breville Nespresso The Creatista Pro with a steam wand and milk jug to zhuzh up a latte with some art.

        "text": "By Timothy Dale Updated on Feb 25, 2025 We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more \u203a Water heaters accomplish a simple but essential job: They provide the home with direct access to hot water. The cold water service for the home flows into the water heater, where it is heated and then sent out to the various sinks, showers, and water-using appliances throughout the dwelling. That part is simple, but choosing the right water heater for your needs and space isn\u2019t quite as straightforward. Homeowners can get instant hot water with a tankless water heater or store hot water for future use with a tank-style water heater. We\u2019ve chosen the A. O. Smith Gas Tank Water Heater as our best overall hot water heater, but the right model for your home depends on a number of variables. Here\u2019s how to choose the right one for you. Selecting a list of the best water heaters started with extensive research into a variety of products before the pool of potential appliances could be pared down. To eliminate products from the running, it was necessary to examine each water heater while considering the product specs and how they compared to other water heating appliances. Top considerations include the type of water heater, fuel type, dimensions, flow rate of tankless water heaters, and the tank capacity of tank-style water heaters. Additionally, the availability and cost were assessed alongside these product specs to find the best water heaters across several categories. This list of the best water heaters was finalized only after researching and comparing the pool of potential products to select the top water heaters and eliminate the appliances that didn\u2019t measure up. Tankless water heaters are smaller than tank-style options, allowing them to be installed in tight spaces where a tank water heater could not. These water heaters provide instant access to hot water, though they may not be able to keep up with the demands of a large family. Tank-style water heaters have an element at the base of an insulated tank to heat the water. The tank keeps the water hot until it is needed. However, if all the hot water stored in the tank is used, then it can take about 20 minutes for the new water in the tank to heat up. While each specific product has its intended audience, it\u2019s worth perusing all of the options as there\u2019s always overlap, and multiple models may fit your needs. Why it made the cut: Homeowners won\u2019t need to worry about running out of hot water quickly with this bulky 50-gallon gas water heater. Specs While tankless water heaters will heat the water as it passes through the appliance, tank-style water heaters, like this appliance from A. O. Smith, store a large amount of hot water for future use. This A. O. Smith gas water heater has a large capacity storage tank that is capable of storing up to 50 gallons of water. This tank-style water heater uses natural gas and a 40,000-BTU gas burner to heat up the tank\u2019s contents. Gas water heaters can be more expensive than electric water heaters, though the cost of natural gas tends to be less than the cost of electricity, so these appliances are often more affordable in the long term. This appliance can also be used in locations that are high up in the mountains, with a certification for altitudes up to 10,100 feet. Additionally, the gas water heater has a built-in self-diagnostic system that monitors the electronic gas control and uses an LED status indicator to communicate the system\u2019s operational status. For added protection, this model also has a built-in safety system that reduces the risk of accidental flammable vapor ignitions. However, before investing in this unit, it\u2019s important to measure the space and compare it against the product dimensions to ensure that the appliance will fit in the designated area. Why it made the cut: Get hot water directly at the sink or shower with this 2.7-gallon point-of-use water heater. Specs Whole-home water heaters are the most common option for heating incoming cold water, but homeowners can also invest in a point-of-use water heater, like this Bosch Tronic model. This point-of-use water heater can work independently of the primary water heater for the home to provide hot water to a single faucet or shower, but it can also be set up to work in line as a backup for the primary water heater during busy periods throughout the day, like the morning or evening. The small size and lightweight design make this water heater easy to carry and maneuver into position during installation. However, this also means that the water heater has a relatively small storage capacity of just 2.7 gallons, so it isn\u2019t a good option for extended use or whole-home water heating. Mount the water heater on the floor, the wall, under the sink, or under the counter with the included mounting brackets. Why it made the cut: Heat 62 gallons of water in the first hour of use with the two 4,500-watt copper heating elements. Specs This electric water heater by A. O. Smith has a large storage tank that can hold up to 50 gallons of water. The appliance uses non-CFC polyurethane foam insulation and factory-installed heat trap nipples to reduce heat loss and greatly improve the operating efficiency of the unit. The storage tank has a slim profile that fits into tight corners with only a 20.5-inch diameter and 59-inch height. Despite the tall, narrow shape, this electric water heater is capable of heating 62 gallons of water in an hour by using the two 4,500-watt copper heating elements. These elements provide superior heating power to shorten the time it takes to heat the incoming cold water. Users can set the ideal water temperature using the built-in adjustable thermostat located on the body of the water heater. However, due to the size and weight of the water heater, it\u2019s recommended to have at least two people when moving it into position. Why it made the cut: Get instant access to hot water on demand at any sink, shower, or water-using appliance in the home with this tankless water heater. Specs The main benefit of a tankless water heater is that users don\u2019t need to wait for the water to heat up. Instead, this tankless water heater can warm 7.5 gallons of water per minute, providing the entire home with on-demand access to hot water. Also, due to the built-in temperature lock, homeowners don\u2019t need to worry about kids or other home residents changing the temperature on the water heater. While tank-style water heaters may take up an entire corner of a room, the compact size and shape of this tankless water heater make it easier to find space for the installation. However, the Rinnai gas tankless water heater operates using natural gas, so during the installation of this appliance, the plumber or installer will need to run venting to the outside to ensure that the exhaust does not build up inside the home. Why it made the cut: This tankless electric water heater features flow control and self-modulation technology to improve energy efficiency. Specs Big, tank-style water heaters can be a great choice for large homes and big families with a high water demand. But these tank-style appliances take up a lot of space and aren\u2019t really necessary when there are only a few people living in the home. With this in mind, the Rheem tankless electric water heater is an excellent alternative for homes with one or two people. The Rheem water heater has a built-in flow sensor and self-modulating technology that automatically modifies the amount of energy consumption to meet hot water needs. This tankless water heater provides the home with on-demand access to hot water at any faucet, shower, or water-using appliance, so users no longer need to wait for hot water. However, it should be noted that this water heater can only supply one or two fixtures simultaneously, so it isn\u2019t a good idea to take a shower while running the clotheswasher or dishwasher. Before purchasing a new water heater for the home, it\u2019s important to gain a basic understanding of the types available, as well as the key factors that can affect the efficiency and operation of the appliance. Consider the type of fuel, the size of the water heater, and the capacity to determine the best water heater to meet your needs. The first factor to consider when looking into new water heaters is the type of model that would work best for the home. Traditional tank-style water heaters have commonly been used in homes in the past, but tankless options are quickly growing in popularity. Point-of-use water heaters provide another option for homeowners who don\u2019t want to run out of hot water while showering or washing dishes. Tank-style water heaters are the standard option for a home. Cold water runs into the water heater and is then heated up and stored in a large insulated storage tank for future use. This design ensures that there is a significant amount of hot water ready for use, but if the entire hot water supply is emptied, then users will need to wait for the cold water to be heated. Tankless water heaters benefit from heating water as it passes through the appliance. This takes just a few seconds, allowing for on-demand hot water to the home. Additionally, tankless water heaters take up less space than tank-style. The drawback with these appliances is that they may struggle to keep up with hot water demands for a larger household, especially during the busy periods of the day. Point-of-use water heaters can be either tank-style or tankless. The defining feature of these water heaters is that they are designed for installation at one specific faucet, shower, or other plumbing fixture. The intent is to ensure that there is always hot water available when someone wants to use the specific plumbing fixture. This can be a highly effective way to prevent the water from running cold in the middle of a shower. There are three main types, including electricity, natural gas, and propane. Electric water heaters tend to be the least expensive to purchase and install, but the operating costs are typically higher due to the cost of electricity. These water heaters do not require venting, so they can be a good option if the home does not currently have existing ventilation for a gas water heater. And you could run some models off a portable power station in the event of weather that knocks out the mains. Natural gas water heaters are a common option, though the installer may need to run ventilation lines for the exhaust. These appliances have a higher power output than electric models, allowing them to heat the water at a faster rate. However, natural gas water heaters tend to cost more to purchase and install. Propane water heaters are less common than electric or natural gas units, but these appliances can be effective for small homes, point-of-use installations, or even for some RVs. The main issue that makes propane water heaters less appealing is that the homeowner or user needs to purchase or refill propane tanks for regular operation. But, if you already have a propane grill or a propane generator, this shouldn\u2019t be a new experience. One of the main reasons to invest in a tankless water heater over a tank style is the size. Tankless water heaters have a compact size and shape that can fit in tight spaces where a large tank cannot. For this reason, tankless typically works better for small houses and condominiums. Similarly, point-of-use water heaters don\u2019t take up a lot of room, allowing them to be installed under the counter or under the sink. While a tank-style water heater does take up more space than the other water heater options, homeowners can find tank-style products with tall, narrow profiles that make it easier to install the water heater in a tight corner or small maintenance room. Just make sure to take proper measurements of the space and the water heater to ensure the unit will fit. Also, don\u2019t forget to leave enough room for water lines, electrical connections, gas lines, and gas vents. For a tank-style water heater, capacity means the amount of water that can be stored inside the insulated tank. Typically, tanks range in size from about 30 gallons to 80 gallons, though most homes will have a 40- to 50-gallon capacity. The capacity of a tankless water heater refers to the flow rate, as well as the amount of water that can be heated within a specific timeframe. Generally, the flow rate is measured in gallons per minute or GPM. Small tankless water heaters may only be able to produce three to four gallons of hot water per minute, while larger units may be capable of heating more than seven gallons per minute. For reference, faucets typically require 0.5 GPM, dishwashers require 1 GPM, washing machines require 1.5 GPM, and showers require 2 to 2.5 GPM. The lifespan of a water heater is heavily dependent on how well the appliance is maintained, as well as the frequency of use. On average, a water heater will last about eight to 12 years, though some can last up to 20 years before needing to be replaced. There are a few signs that you can look out for to help determine when it\u2019s time for a water heater upgrade. One indication that the water heater isn\u2019t working properly is that the appliance overheats. Additionally, if the appliance struggles to heat the water in the tank or keep up with heating demands, then it may be time for a maintenance call to clean any built-up sediment out of the water heater. If this doesn\u2019t work, you may need to consider upgrading the appliance. When a water heater no longer heats up, it can be due to a variety of issues. Check to make sure the water heater breaker is on to ensure the unit is receiving power. If you have a gas water heater, verify that the gas valve is open and the pilot light is on. In some cases, the problem may be due to a significant sediment buildup in the bottom of the water heater. This can act as an insulating barrier, preventing the water from heating up. Hot water is a necessary part of everyday life. People use it to wash dishes, clean the house, do loads of laundry, sanitize household surfaces, and bathe. It can also be used simply to relax under the warm spray of the shower after a long day at work. With this in mind, a water heater is an important appliance that should be properly maintained to avoid any issues with the availability of hot water in the home. Tankless water heaters are a suitable option for small families and small to mid-size homes. Even larger homes can benefit from the on-demand functionality of tankless water heaters, though you may need more than one unit to accommodate the water demands of the entire home. Tank-style water heaters are less expensive to purchase and can store a substantial amount of water for future use. However, when no one is home, the water heater will continue using energy to heat and reheat the tank\u2019s contents, leading to energy waste. Consider the pros and cons of each type to decide on the best water heaters for the home. Popular Science\u00a0started writing about technology more than 150 years ago.

        "text": "By Chelsea Frank Updated on Feb 25, 2025 We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more \u203a Dehumidifiers remove excess moisture from your home or office space. Maybe you live in a humid climate and don\u2019t want your furniture, clothing, or office space to be warped by excess vapor in the air, or you have a damp basement that smells funky. Dehumidifiers are a great option for these types of environments, so you can prevent allergies, dust mites, and mold, all of which are a huge pain to deal with. In fact, studies show that indoor humidity can affect respiratory infections and allergies and that maintaining indoor humidity levels between 40 and 60 percent may be better for your health and well-being. The top dehumidifier can help you identify humidity levels, and keep a consistent air quality. Dehumidifiers can also help pantry food stay fresh for longer or accelerate drying time when hang-drying fresh laundry. With all these benefits, a dehumidifier is definitely a necessary investment if you live in a damp environment. We picked the GoveeLife Smart Dehumidifier but keep reading to find the best model for your specific circumstances. There are a few crucial elements to consider when shopping for dehumidifiers. First, we looked at pint capacity (i.e., how much water the unit can successfully remove daily). We want to ensure your dehumidifier is as effective as possible in drying out your space. We considered dozens of the most popular models with the most relevant features, drawing on years of experience in the health and wellness space. We also considered whether the model came with a drain pump or hose so you wouldn\u2019t have to manually empty the excess water reservoir. Additionally, we wanted to recommend models that were as easy to use and operate as possible: features such as auto-turn off, auto restart, Wi-Fi connectivity, etc., were among the capabilities we looked for. Finally, we looked at the noise level. Who wants to be disturbed by loud machinery? Less humidity and less noise are always top considerations. The best dehumidifiers suck out moisture from the air, essentially \u201cdehumidifying\u201d the space. They\u2019re sort of like a vacuum cleaner, but instead of sucking up dust and dirt, they suck in moist air through a fan. Then, they draw out the condensation and release warmer, dry air back into the room.\u00a0That makes them different from air purifiers, though, the two often work together. Some models work more like a refrigerators in that the warm, wet air passes over freezing pipes that cool the air. Then, the dry, cool air passes over a hot compressor unit and gets released back at room temperature through a grille. The excess water can be collected and removed in one of two ways, depending on the model you select. The water is either released into a removable reservoir that you can drain manually or circulated out of the unit automatically through a hose. Our recommendations are suited for every size of home and budget. Specs: If you don\u2019t need a dehumidifier with a built-in pump, GoveeLife\u2019s Smart Dehumidifier is your best option. The Energy Star-compliant dehumidifier can cover an area of up to 4,500 square feet, which means an entire floor of your home (such as a basement), and suck up to 50 pints of water from your air each day. Its Wi-Fi features allow you to control and monitor the dehumidifier through an app on your iOS or Android-enabled device, and you\u2019ll receive a notification when its tank is full. GoveeLife includes a drain hose, though you have the option to attach a garden hose to the dehumidifier\u2014it\u2019ll be larger and get water out more quickly\u2014if you\u2019d prefer. If you\u2019ve set up a smart home, you can control the dehumidifier using Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Assistant to operate it completely hands-free. Don\u2019t worry; if you\u2019re less technically inclined, you can also adjust its settings manually by pushing buttons on top of the device. The dehumidifier is equipped with a \u201cSmart Comfort Mode,\u201d which will automatically regulate the humidity in your room as it fluctuates. You can see how the humidity in your home changes over the course of the day through GoveeLife\u2019s app. This happens in real-time, so you don\u2019t need to set it up. While GoveeLife\u2019s Smart Dehumidifier is among the smartest models we\u2019re recommending, it\u2019s also the best overall value. Normally $299.99, it can often be found for $80-$100 less, thanks to frequent Amazon coupons. Specs: If you have a large area and want a set-it-and-forget-it solution for managing your humidifier, hOmeLabs has you covered. Its humidifier can cover an area of up to 4,500 square feet, remove up to 50 liters of water from your home each day, and empty its tank with a single button push thanks to a built-in pump. It\u2019s a little more expensive than our top pick, and doesn\u2019t have any Wi-Fi-enabled features, but the inclusion of a pump more than makes up for it. Once you\u2019ve set the dehumidifier up\u2014a control panel on top of the appliance handles this in a few button presses\u2014you shouldn\u2019t need to adjust it very often. The dehumidifier will beep when its tank is full, at which point you can empty it by activating its pump. Automatic overheat protection is a feature that\u2019ll come in handy if you run this dehumidifier continuously\u2014especially when sleeping, and its auto restart function will bring the dehumidifier back to life if you experience a power surge. These little touches\u2014on top of having a pump and covering a large area\u2014make hOmeLabs\u2019 dehumidifier stand out. If you live in a single-floor dwelling or multi-floor home with an open staircase, this dehumidifier is the one to get and worth its cost. Specs: Honeywell\u2019s Smart dehumidifier may not cover as much space as hOmeLabs\u2019, but is a little less expensive and was also designed to remove odors. Energy Star deemed this one of its Most Efficient options, a distinction that\u2019s important if you\u2019d like to run it all the time without significantly raising your utility bill every month. The dehumidifier has thermal overload protection to keep it from overheating, and is made from a heat-safe casting. You can set up this dehumidifier to begin automatically at a set temperature so it\u2019ll kick on to keep you comfortable before you need it. It may not have smart features, but you can set this dehumidifier to continuously drain its tank thanks to its built-in pump. This is a great feature if you plan to be out of the house for an extended period of time, but it would have been even better if this dehumidifier was smart, so you could keep track of how often it was being emptied. Regardless, this is an optional setting, albeit one that\u2019s very welcome and a primary reason this is the best dehumidifier with a pump. If you\u2019d like to take a mostly hands-off approach to moderating your home\u2019s climate, this is the dehumidifier to get. Specs: Waykar\u2019s 130 Pint Dehumidifier is designed for office spaces, storage facilities, or similar work environments, and it\u2019s a heavy-duty option if you\u2019ve got serious climate control needs. It can remove nearly three times as much water from the air daily than our other recommendations, and cover way more space to boot. Waykar recommends using it in a wine cellar or similar space, where ignoring environmental control isn\u2019t an option. This dehumidifier also features a continuous drain feature, which, as the name suggests, will monitor the status of its water tank and automatically empty it periodically. You can also empty its internal bucket if you\u2019d prefer or if you don\u2019t have a sink or other drainage area in the room. A small transparent strip on the front of the dehumidifier allows you to see how full its tank is at a glance, which is helpful if you\u2019re emptying it out manually. The dehumidifier doesn\u2019t have any smart features, which is surprising given its higher price and automatic draining function. It\u2019d be helpful to get an alert each time the tank is being emptied or enable and disable the feature depending on how long you\u2019ll be out of your house. Still, there\u2019s no denying that this is the best dehumidifier if you\u2019ve got a very large area that needs continual maintenance. Specs: If you\u2019d like to control your home\u2019s climate but live in a small space or are on a tight budget, NineSky has you covered. For $50, you\u2019re getting a dehumidifier that covers 300 square feet and can suck 1.88 pints of water out of the air without reaching capacity. This is a great bathroom dehumidifier or one to keep on a bedside table overnight to prevent waking up due to discomfort. At just under 10-inches tall and a tiny bit over six-inches wide, you can fit this dehumidifier just about anywhere. It\u2019s also just over 3 pounds, so you can carry it from room to room throughout the day if you have a home office that you\u2019d like to keep comfortable during the day before bringing it back to your bedroom once the sun goes down. While it\u2019s a lot less feature-rich than our larger, more expensive dehumidifier recommendations, NineSky didn\u2019t skimp out on the essentials. This dehumidifier will automatically shut down when its tank is full to prevent it from spilling over, and it only has two buttons, which makes it easy to operate. If you\u2019re in a dorm room or other smaller space and wake up feeling uncomfortably sticky in the summertime, NineSky\u2019s dehumidifier is essential. (Looking for more small dehumidifier options? We\u2019ve got you covered.) There are many factors to consider when deciding which dehumidifier is right for you. Below are the factors we considered most important when writing this guide. Dehumidifiers can be broken down into one of three categories, and we\u2019ve explained the differences between them below. This is an indicator of how much water, or humidity, will be absorbed throughout the day. This is rated in moisture absorbed per 24 hours (i.e., a 30-pint humidifier removes 30 pints of moisture per day, then 50 pints, then 70 pints, etc). Selecting pint capacity depends on your room size and how damp the room is. Do you need a dehumidifier that can work for an entire house or office space? Or will you need a smaller, more portable model for just one room? Portable dehumidifiers are less expensive upfront, but whole-home dehumidifiers are more energy efficient in the long term. Dehumidifiers can range anywhere from 50 to 800 watts. The higher the wattage, the more powerful, but also the higher your energy bill might be. This is something to consider, so look for Energy Star certified dehumidifiers to make sure you\u2019re not wasting energy and running up that bill. According to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), humidity levels indoors should be kept below 60% to prevent mold and an infestation of pests. If your humidity levels reach 60% or higher, you can use a dehumidifier to bring those levels back down. Generally speaking, a dehumidifier will have the most impact on the room it\u2019s actually in. While some dehumidifiers promote reaching a large amount of square footage, closed doors, and long hallways may hinder its ability to reach the humid air in other rooms.\u00a0For example, if you have a particularly damp basement, you can place your main dehumidifier in the basement and then place smaller, portable dehumidifiers in other rooms. No, you do not need to replace filters. Dehumidifiers come with permanent filters that you can periodically rinse and clean to ensure long-term, extended use. It depends on the size of the dehumidifier you\u2019re using. Larger dehumidifiers use more energy, but they typically do not need to run as often, so they may be more energy efficient overall.\u00a0Look for Energy Star Certified labels to ensure that your dehumidifier \u201cuses more efficient refrigeration coils, compressors, and fans to remove the same amount of moisture as a similarly-sized conventional unit but uses nearly 15% less energy.\u201d Dehumidifiers are a lifesaver when it comes to keeping our humidity levels at bay. Stave off mold, allergies, and dust mites with the help of this water-sucking device. Just be sure to find ones that are Energy Star certified to keep your utility bill as low as your humidity!

        "text": "By Amanda Reed Updated on Feb 25, 2025 We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more \u203a If you\u2019re trying to prevent mold from messing with your lungs, there are air purifiers that are made just for that. You find mold in places that encounter a lot of contact with water, like\u00a0roofs, windows, and pipes. Mold can also be found on paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, wood products, dust, paints, wallpaper, insulation, drywall, carpet, fabric, and upholstery. Although that\u2019s an overwhelming number of possible things that can become moldy, you can take quick action. We picked the PuroAir HEPA 14 Air Purifier as our best overall air purifier for mold, but your budget, space, and preferences determine the best model for you. We\u2019ve written about air purifiers before, so we took what we knew about them and went a bit further with testing. We weren\u2019t looking at its ability to prevent mold, since that\u2019s what dehumidifiers are for. We looked for features like HEPA filtration and the percentage of micro-sized particles it can trap. In order to find the best air purifiers for mold, we also looked at critical reviews and user recommendations and conducted first-hand research. The best air purifer for mold may be different than the best air purifier for smoke or other applications. If you have asthma, you\u2019ll also want to check out our list of the best air purifiers for asthma. When it comes to AQI (the Air Quality Index), it\u2019s like the game of Limbo: How low can you go? Keeping particulates out of our body is the goal of these selections, as mold is only good in blue cheese, penicillin, and tempeh\u2014and that\u2019s only if you\u2019re not allergic or intolerant to any of them. Leave the fuzziness to those old raspberries in your fridge, not your lungs (OK, clear out the raspberries, too). Specs The PuroAir HEPA 14 Air Purifier covers a massive 1,115 square feet and includes a powerful HEPA 14 air filter, which is ten times more powerful than HEPA 13. What you get is a hospital-grade air purifier under $200 that removes 99.99% of fine particles down to .1 microns in size. Mold? Sorry, you won\u2019t find any here. It\u2019s third-party lab tested and certified, meaning you\u2019re getting a scientifically-developed air purifier from scientists and virologists at Harvard, MIT, Johns Hopkins, and Oxford universities that are backed up by other scientists. A smart particle sensor monitors air quality and increases power if polluted air is detected. A flat, touch-controlled panel includes settings for timer, fan speed, a sleep mode that turns off all lights on the unit, filter replacement indicator, and child lock. It\u2019s incredibly quiet even when running at its highest speed, and they\u2019re incredibly intuitive to use. The replacement filters are a little expensive, but we think it\u2019s a price worth paying. Specs If you\u2019re looking for an air purifier that is a bit more customizable and versatile, consider the Mila. Instead of offering one filter that does everything OK, the Mila gives you seven filters, each aimed at solving a particular need. You can swap them out depending on the season or to target a particular need. We\u2019re a fan of the Overreactor, which eliminates food odors, formaldehyde from furniture and flooring, and almost 98 percent of nine types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plus, the integrated hospital-grade HEPA 14 filter with modified granular carbon gives new meaning to \u201cfresh air.\u201d The unit also has eight environmental sensors, including CO2 and humidity sensors, which are important for mold prevention. It\u2019s literally as quiet as a library, thanks to its 24-decibel output. It\u2019s also super sensitive: the air purifier kicked into high gear when I sprayed an aerosol air freshener in the room. Mila\u2019s app is where this connected smart-home device shines, however. Available for Android and iOS, the app gives you more preset modes like Bubble Boy (which keeps the AQI as low as possible, no matter the setting), sleep, white noise, energy save, Turndown Service, and child lock. The air purifier is also incredibly stylish. Its cube shape gives \u201ctechnologically advanced fancy marshmallow\u201d compared to \u201cbleak, unaesthetic cylinder\u201d like many others on the market. The Mila is expensive, but you get lots of perks and flexibility. Specs If you want to keep mold out of the air but want something that can cover a wide area, or you want to purify multiple rooms at once, the Shark HP302 NeverChange Air Purifier MAX has the largest square footage of coverage out of all the air purifiers we tested. A five-year HEPA filter means you don\u2019t have to worry about reordering one shortly after purchasing. The filter itself can trap 99.98% of particles of all sizes, and debris defense protection prevents build-up fox maximum performance. We especially love its included odor neutralizer that releases a fresh scent in your home. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen implemented in the company\u2019s Stratos Cordless Vacuum; we loved how it performed with the vacuum, and we\u2019re happy it\u2019s in this air purifier. Clean Sense IQ constantly adjusts power based on air quality throughout your home, which you can see when tapping the Air Info symbol on the touch panel. Speaking of, if you\u2019re not in the mood for auto mode, the touch panel includes settings for timer, brightness control, and fan speed. It\u2019s taller compared to other air purifiers, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for never having to change the filter. Specs This extra-large air purifier from Dyson resembles a dish antenna, but don\u2019t let its unconventional shape fool you. This large format device means business. It projects air over 32 feet, easily purifies large spaces, and has adjustable airflow. If you\u2019d like to conjure a spring wind in the comfort of your own home, consider this a breath of fresh air thanks to Breeze Mode, which brings the outdoor breeze feeling inside. The heavy-duty H13 filter can last up to 5 years, and a hygienic replacement mechanism lets you replace it in one click, relatively germ-free. The purifier itself is acoustically engineered to operate quietly, even when it\u2019s working to the max. It comes with a remote\u2014hello, convenience\u2014and can also be controlled using the MyDyson app (available for Android and iOS). Do Not Disturb mode purifies the air while using the quietest settings and dims the display so you can get the darkest environment for the best sleep. It\u2019s pricey, but being able to emulate fresh air in your own home is priceless. Scooting around your silly-shaped air purifier on its included hidden wheels? That is some Smart House tech I can get behind. Specs This sub-$100 air purifier packs a punch well beyond its price. It\u2019s incredibly quiet, easy to use, and lightweight for moving around the house. Its touch panel comes with three airflow presets (I, II, III), a quiet mode, a timer, a child lock, and a \u201clights off\u201d button that turns off the panel lights without shutting down the air purifier. Each filter lasts for six months, and they come in a two-pack so you only need to order them once a year. I\u2019ve purchased this air purifier twice and would buy it again for every room in my apartment. I\u2019ve used the general filter that comes with it and have had no problems, but the toxin absorber filter (sold separately) is a perfect match for mold catching. If you\u2019re looking to pay extra for a WiFi-enabled model, it\u2019s your lucky day. Mold exposure can lead to a stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing or wheezing, burning eyes, or rash. People with asthma or who are allergic to mold may have severe reactions like shortness of breath or chest tightness. Immunocompromised people and people with chronic lung disease may get lung infections from mold. With all this considered, it\u2019s important to find an air purifier that works. Here\u2019s what features you should consider before hitting \u201cadd to cart\u201d: Most air purifiers are designed to clean the air in a single room. Because of this, many models include a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) to show how fast it can purify the air in the room. The higher the CADR, the larger area an air purifier is able to clean. Generally, you should look for an air purifier with a CADR of 2/3 the square footage of a space. If you\u2019re looking to put an air purifier in a 100-square-foot room, you\u2019ll need a minimum CADR of 65, per Energy Star. HEPA stands for \u201chigh-efficiency particulate air\u201d and has been used since World War II. That\u2019s pretty neat. If you\u2019re looking for a filter specifically for mold, look for H13 or H14 HEPA filters. They\u2019re the highest tier of filtration and are considered medical or hospital grade. Additionally, if you don\u2019t want to think about filter speed or changing settings as air quality changes, consider an air purifier with sensors that increase the amount of air filtered for you. A higher fan speed for a longer time increases the amount of clean air in your home. The best air purifiers for mold only filter out spores already in the air. The CDC recommends keeping humidity levels no higher than 50% in your home to prevent mold. An air conditioner or dehumidifier can help, and you can buy a humidity meter to monitor levels in your home. Fix any roof, wall, or plumbing leaks, and add mold inhibitors to paint or use a mold-inhibiting primer before painting. You should also dry out your home 24-28 hours after a flood and remove or replace carpets and upholstery that have been soaked and cannot be dried right away. Bathrooms and basements often harbor the most mold since they get moist easily when not built properly. Surface mold growth, like on the tile or in the caulk, is easy to clean. Use a mold-killing cleaner like this Lysol shower spray with bleach or remove the caulk and replace it with the highest quality caulking you can find. However, removing mold growing behind the shower is a job for a contractor, unless you are the handyperson in your home. Should you test your home for mold? The CDC says no since the health effects of mold are different in everyone. Good mold sampling is often expensive, and there are no set standards for acceptable kinds and qualities of mold in homes. Color also isn\u2019t an indication of mold danger. Save your money to remove any mold in your home and keep it at bay. So, should you be constantly vigilant of mold? According to the CDC, probably not. There is a little mold everywhere. Molds that may be toxigenic\u2014a.k.a., they produce toxins, specifically mycotoxins\u2014are as hazardous as the common molds in your home. There are few reports that toxigenic molds in homes can cause pulmonary hemorrhage or memory loss. A link between the two has not been proven, and these reports are rare. If you have asthma, are allergic to mold, are immune-compromised, or have chronic lung disease, talk to your doctor about what you can do to protect yourself against mold. Some air purifiers can be controlled via an app that gives you deeper insights into the air in your home. Some have internal sensors that detect the air quality in your home and adjust the filter speed accordingly. However, these features can hike up the price. If you get annoyed with air purifiers beeping when the air quality is poor, look for something that lets you turn the signal off, or consider a model that is beep-free. You already can\u2019t stand when you set the fire alarm off while you\u2019re cooking. You don\u2019t need any more unnecessary beeping in your life. Air purifiers require some montly upkeep to keep them performing their best. If you have pets\u2014particularly those that leave fuzzy tumbleweeds all over the house\u2014vacuum the pre-filter (aka, the opening where air enters the filter) to remove any fur that has accumulated against the outside. If your air purifier is in a corner or behind a piece of furniture, you should move it. You should stick your air purifier near a particular pollutant that\u2019s bothering you. It should also be 3-5 feet off the ground if it\u2019s not tower-styled. Brownie points for putting it by places with good airflow, like doorways and windows. Moving your air purifier from place to place also helps with efficacy. Purified air is just as good for plants as it is for humans. They\u2019ll be fine unless your model expels ozone. Your plants should be safe and sound in the presence of an air purifier otherwise. There\u2019s no reason not to sleep with the air purifier on. Many models come with an overnight mode to help you sleep\u2014unless the white noise of an air purifier is up your alley. Regardless, creating an overall healthy home environment is something you won\u2019t lose rest over. That depends on your air purifier. Some can last for years, while others need to be replaced every six months or less. You should wear protective gloves and a mask to make sure you\u2019re not inhaling the mold the air purifier collected out of the air. You can stop mold on surfaces with a quick wipe of a powerful cleaner. Mold in the air is a different story. When looking for an air purifier made specifically for getting rid of this particular allergen, ensure it comes with a hospital-grade H14 HEPA filter to get all the lung irritants out of the air. Keep in mind the size of your space to maximize its efficacy and fun add-on features like app control. You can breathe easily, knowing that your lungs will be relatively mold-free with the right pick. Updates Writer Amanda Reed is a commerce updates writer at Popular Science.

        "title": "How to move digital purchases between two Apple Accounts | Popular Science",
        "text": "By David Nield Posted on Feb 24, 2025 Apple users have long requested the option to transfer digital content\u2014like movies and apps\u2014between two accounts, and those wishes have now been granted. Whether you use two accounts in tandem, you\u2019re moving from an old account to a new one, or another reason, you can now move your digital stuff between accounts. There are some important caveats to bear in mind: iCloud data isn\u2019t included, for example, so you need to take care of that separately. You\u2019re also going to be abandoning any personalized recommendations in the secondary account after you move everything to a primary one. If this is something you need to do, here\u2019s how to do it. This process focuses on moving purchased apps, music, books, shows, and movies from one Apple Account (the secondary account) to another (the primary account). You need to know the email address or phone number for both accounts, as well as the passwords, and the accounts shouldn\u2019t be shared with anyone else (as with Family Sharing, for example). Two-factor authentication needs to be enabled for both accounts, and they both need to be set to the same country and region as far as purchases go. Make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on your device\u2014you need an iPhone or an iPad to complete this process. As well as the purchases moving from the secondary to the primary account, the subscriptions and the payment methods do as well. If you\u2019ve set up Apple Music and Apple Podcasts, this information will also transfer and replace the equivalent data on the primary account\u2014so if this applies to you, make sure the primary account libraries are okay to be overwritten. The secondary account sticks around, but you will no longer be able to purchase anything with it\u2014all of that transfers to the primary account. If you have remaining credit in your secondary account (from a gift card, for example), then get it all spent and cleared before you start the migration process. Finally, make sure you have payment information (like debit cards) in hand for both accounts before you get the migration started: You\u2019ll be asked to verify the payment information as everything is moved over, and then going forward you can make all of your purchases from the primary account. That\u2019s quite a lot to take in before you get started, but the actual migration process is relatively straightforward. On your iPhone or iPad, open the Settings screen, tap your name, then tap Media & Purchases: This should be the secondary account, and a different one to the main account for the device. If it isn\u2019t, sign out first and then sign into your secondary Apple account here. You can then tap View Account, scroll down, and select Migrate Purchases. You\u2019ll be given a chance to review all the information for both accounts, and everything you\u2019re moving over, before the transfer gets started. Apple doesn\u2019t offer an estimate of how long everything\u2019s going to take, but you should get a confirmation on this screen when it\u2019s done. Emails will also be dispatched to the inboxes for both accounts, to say the process is complete. At that point, you can then sign into the primary account in the Media & Purchases part of Settings. This is actually more of a merging of two accounts in some ways, rather than a transfer, so bear that in mind: It\u2019s really for users who have older accounts hanging around and want to move to one single account.You can undo a migration if you want, though not everything will be rolled back (payment information will be lost, so you\u2019ll need to set that up again). If you want to undo a migration, go to Settings on your device and tap your name then Media & Purchases: Choose View Account and then Undo Migration to set the process going. If you undo a migration, you\u2019ll be blocked from migrating again using the same accounts for a year.

        "title": "New evidence suggests Mars once had 'vacation-style beaches' | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 24, 2025 Present-day Mars is a barren and inhospitable planet, but it may have once had sandy beaches and tranquil ocean vistas. According to findings published on February 24 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Red Planet may have remained a vacation-worthy destination for tens of millions of years\u2014while also providing the proper conditions to support microbial life. The evidence comes from data collected by China\u2019s Zhurong Mars rover, which landed in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars in 2021. Unlike other rovers traversing the planet, Zhurong arrived with high- and low-frequency radar systems that allow it to conduct ground-penetrating scans of the Martian subsurface. After reviewing the rover\u2019s data, an international team, including researchers at Penn State, believe that they have spotted layered structures with remarkable similarities to what can be found all over Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re finding places on Mars that used to look like ancient beaches and ancient river deltas,\u201d Benjamin Cardenas, a Penn State assistant professor of geology and study co-author, said in an accompanying statement. \u201cWe found evidence for wind, waves, no shortage of sand\u2014a proper, vacation-style beach.\u201d Cardenas and colleagues are particularly focused on what appears to be ancient, long-buried \u201cforeshore deposits.\u201d A common feature on shorelines across Earth, foreshore deposits are downward sloping geological formations created by tides and waves as they gradually wash sediment into a large body of water. \u201cThis stood out to us immediately because it suggests there were waves, which means there was a dynamic interface of air and water,\u201d Cardenas added. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to the authors, both the Martian foreshore deposit angles and sediment thicknesses fall right within the range of those on Earth. Further analysis also indicated these foreshore deposits on Mars weren\u2019t the result of river flows, volcanic activity, or wind\u2014leaving oceanic coasts the most likely explanation. If true, this further supports the hypothesis that an ocean once covered a substantial portion of the northern pole of Mars. A body of water big enough to generate waves and tides also raises the chances of the planet supporting life. \u201c[I]t suggests\u2026 there was a dynamic interface of air and water,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cWhen we look back at where the earliest life on Earth developed, it was in the interaction between oceans and land, so this is painting a picture of ancient habitable environments, capable of harboring conditions friendly toward microbial life.\u201d These warm, wet conditions suitable for life possibly spanned tens of millions of years on Mars, presenting ample time for shorelines to shift while fostering the development of organisms. \u201cWe tend to think about Mars as just a static snapshot of a planet, but it was evolving,\u201d explained Cardenas.

        "title": "Southeast Asian sailors possibly mastered seafaring before Polynesians | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Andrew Paul Posted on Feb 24, 2025 Humans have navigated the open oceans for thousands of years, but new evidence indicates communities in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and the Philippines set sail aboard advanced boats as much as 40,000 years ago. The archeological finds, comparable to technology found in much later civilizations, challenge longheld assumptions on when and where early modern peoples around the world first engaged in seafaring. If true, ocean voyages around the Philippines and ISEA could predate even some ancient Polynesian trips. Despite never directly connecting to mainland Asia through land bridges or ice sheets, archeologists have long documented the presence of early human settlements across ISEA. How they managed to successfully cross hundreds of miles of open water, however, remained a mystery. Given the vast majority of organic boating materials quickly decompose, experts couldn\u2019t be sure whether these Paleolithic sailors passively drifted to the islands on rudimentary bamboo rafts, or if they employed more complex techniques and vessels to reach them. After analyzing finds at multiple dig sites across the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, researchers at Ateneo de Manila University now believe the ancient travellers\u2019 boats and navigational knowledge surpassed previous hypotheses. Their findings, detailed in a study published in the Journal of Archeological Science: Reports, are based on microscopic examinations of millennia-old stone tools that showcase evidence of plant processing. Specifically, users appeared to employ these implements to extract fibers needed to create nets, ropes, and other binding essentials needed for both boatbuilding and fishing. The team\u2019s theories were further bolstered by the discovery of remains from deep sea fish like tuna and sharks, as well as additional fishing tools including net weights, gorges, and hooks. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to the study\u2019s authors, these predatory pelagic fish \u201cindicate the capacity for advanced seafaring and knowledge of the seasonality and migration routes of those fish species,\u201d while the fishing equipment implies \u201cthe need for strong and well-crafted cordage for ropes and fishing lines to catch the marine fauna.\u201d Taken altogether, the authors argue that it\u2019s now likely early modern sailors piloted far more advanced boats than simple rafts, probably made from organic composite materials bound with plant-based ropes. Similar cordage would also have been used for deep-sea fishing of migratory prey, indicating an intricate understanding of migratory patterns, seafaring, and navigation. These findings also contradict the popular theory that similar technological development during the Paleolithic era can only be traced to certain regions across Africa and Europe.

        "text": "By Laura Baisas Posted on Feb 24, 2025 A photo uploaded to popular citizen science social network iNaturalist is a snapshot of the first new genus and species of plant discovered in a US national park in almost 50 years. The wooly devil (Ovicula biradiata) was found in Big Bend National Park in Texas with bright red petals and is a member of the sunflower family. It is detailed in a study recently published in the journal PhytoKeys. Big Bend National Park is located within the Chihuahuan Desert. This well-studied region is the largest and most biologically diverse warm desert in North America and is home to coyotes, quail, wild horses, alligator lizards, and more. While the Chihuahuan Desert has been the subject of several botanical surveys over the last 100 years, this is the first new plant genus in a national park that scientists have described since 1976. That plant\u2013the mountain-dwelling shrub July gold (Dedeckera eurekensis)\u2013was found in Death Valley National Park. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. \u201cWhile many assume that the plants and animals within our country\u2019s national parks have probably been documented by now, scientists still make surprising new discoveries in these iconic protected landscapes,\u201d Isaac Lichter Marck, a study co-author and California Academy of Sciences plant taxonomist and ecologist, said in a statement. \u201cO. biradiata is a member of the sunflower family, although it does not resemble its sunburst-shaped relatives at first glance.\u201d The team sequenced the plant\u2019s DNA and compared it with other specimens in the California Academy of Sciences\u2019 herbarium. The sequencing revealed that this small and fuzzy plant is both a new species within the sunflower group and distinct enough to be a completely new genus. Park volunteer and study co-author Deb Manley first spotted the plant in March 2024 and harnessed the power of international botanist crowdsourcing to identify this unknown species. O. biradiata is the type of plant that botanists colloquially call a \u201cbelly plant.\u201d These are small and discreet plants that can only be properly observed by lying on the ground. It is a distinctive wild flower with furry white foliage and maroon-colored ray petals. O. biradiata is also quite an ephemeral species, only blooming after rain. It is found in harsh rocky habitats with limited rainfall and grows alongside drought-tolerant shrubs, such as ocotillo, hedgehog cactus, and creosote. \u201cPlants that thrive in deserts are often quite unique, having evolved specific mechanisms to withstand the extreme drought-and-deluge conditions of these arid landscapes\u2014from water-storing structures to rapid life cycles triggered by rain,\u201d said Lichter Marck. \u201cBut as climate change pushes deserts to become hotter and drier, highly specialized plants like the wooly devil face extinction. We have only observed this plant in three narrow locations across the northernmost corner of the park, and it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ve documented a species that is already on its way out.\u201d Ovicula biradiata\u2019s name was inspired by its wooly appearance and the bright red petals. Ovicula means \u201ctiny sheep,\u201d and refers to the thick, white hairs that cover its leaves. It also honors one of Big Bend\u2019s most iconic endangered species\u2013the bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Biradiata, or \u201cbi-radial,\u201d refers to the two ray florets loaded on each of the plant\u2019s flowers. The team working with the plant affectionately called the fuzzy flower the \u201cwooly devil,\u201d which has become its suggested common name. [ Related: Parasitic orchids ditch photosynthesis for fungi. ] \u201cNow that the species has been identified and named, there is a tremendous amount we have yet to learn about it,\u201d study co-author and Big Bend National Park botanist Carolyn Whiting said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to discover whether there are other populations in the park, the details of its life cycle, what pollinates it, and whether we\u2019ll observe it this spring, given the current drought.\u201d Visitors to Big Bend can contribute by documenting wildflowers they encounter following upcoming spring rains and uploading their observations to iNaturalist. The team from this study will also be probing to see if the wooly devil\u2019s potential medicinal properties. \u201cUnder the microscope, we noticed specific glands that are known to possess compounds with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties in other plants within the sunflower family,\u201d study co-author and California Academy of Sciences researcher Keily Peralta said in a statement. \u201cWhile further research is needed to determine these properties, this discovery underscores the potential knowledge we stand to gain from preserving plant diversity in fragile desert ecosystems.\u201d Laura is a science news writer, covering a wide variety of subjects, but she is particularly fascinated by all things aquatic, paleontology, nanotechnology, and exploring how science influences daily life.

        "title": "Behind the wheel of Lamborghinis ripping across a frozen lake | Popular Science",
        "text": "By Kristin Shaw Posted on Feb 23, 2025 Most Lamborghini owners will never drive their supercar on the ice, but they could. The Astrophysics Data System\u2013a digital library portal for researchers in astronomy and physics\u2013built a complex formula for aircraft landings on ice. There are variables for river ice, lake ice, and even \u201cold sea ice\u201d, which is sea ice that has stayed frozen through at least one melting season. And according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, only 10 inches of ice is needed to hold a seven or eight-ton truck. That means I felt pretty comfortable next to a fleet of supercars and superSUVs perched atop three solid feet of ice on Lake Sacacomie, north of Montreal. And I was about to find out just how well the metal-studded snow tires would create traction on that frozen lake at ice driving school. Piloting three Lamborghini models\u2014Urus, Hurac\u00e1n Sterrato, and Revuelto\u2014with a professional driver next to me, I learned how it\u2019s possible for these uber-powerful beasts to drift with finesse and without careening out of control. It\u2019s also nice to know that the ice was thick enough to support a 747. Kevin Conway, a multi-time Lamborghini Super Trofeo racing champion, walked me through how to capably drive on an icy figure-eight course. Shod in Pirelli Scorpion winter tires with hundreds of metal studs embedded into the treads, the Urus SE is a quarter-million-dollar sled. New for 2025, the Urus SE is equipped with a plug-in-hybrid powertrain making a total of 789 horsepower from a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 gas engine assisted by a 192-hp electric motor. As such, the torque curve is significantly smoothed out for better control. If you\u2019re not properly applying the throttle, you\u2019re going to slide without control. In the all-wheel-drive SUV, which is shorter and easier to manage than the two supercars, traction is a matter of technique. Still, driving on the ice with that kind of power could be a disaster if not for those metal-bedazzled tires. \u201cThink about taking chunks of ice and putting it in a blender,\u201d Conway explains from the right seat. \u201cThat\u2019s basically what you\u2019re doing with the studs on the tires. The studs shred the ice, and that\u2019s creating two things: you\u2019re putting heat to the tire, which is making the rubber softer, and you\u2019re gaining the traction you need to be able to corner, accelerate, and decelerate.\u201d Even without studs, Bridgestone\u2019s Blizzak winter tires are formidable on snow and ice, employing microscopic bubbles and tiny slits for maximum grip. As I learned last winter at the tire company\u2019s testing ground and snow driving school in Colorado, winter tires include deeper treads and more sipes (small slits in the tire) that bite into the snow. Like a tiny piranha, the \u201cmouths\u201d of the sipes open as tires roll across the surface, pushing snow or water away to improve the grip. The hybrid Revuelto and its roaring 1001-hp V12 hybrid combination typically rolls on Bridgestone Potenza Sports, but for snow school it gets the grippier winter rubber. Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Adding 400 studs per tire is no joke; Lamborghini hired a whole team to maintain the tires for each day of driving, and the studs regularly fall out as the day goes on. Re-studding them requires pulling the tires from the wheels, combing over the treads to find missing spikes, and then using a special tool to insert and seal them in a way that doesn\u2019t puncture the tire. Don\u2019t try this at home, folks. The Revuelto has four main drive modes: Citt\u00e0, Strada, Sport, and Corsa. It sounds counterintuitive, but Corsa is the one I used, which turns off traction control. Typically, traction control is active as a default. However, when a car is stuck in the snow, turning off the traction function slows the spin of your tires; that\u2019s not what you want when you need grip. When driving on ice, disabling both the stability control and traction control override the driver\u2019s intentions, as the slippery surface is completely different than asphalt. The difference between the Revuelto and the Sterrato goes beyond the drivetrain, which is still powerful in the latter at 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. The Hurac\u00e1n variant was made to tear across the desert at high speed in the dirt and sand, while the Revuelto is a street-and-track star. The Sterrato is rear-wheel drive to the Revuelto\u2019s all-wheel drive, and the Sterrato is shorter and skinnier across. Each has a distinct personality and each works differently on the ice and the road. \u201cDriving the Sterrato is like choking up on the sledgehammer,\u201d lead driver Dean diGiacomo. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to use more effort to swing it to transfer the weight. Driving the Revuelto is like holding the end of the sledgehammer, where it takes more effort to get the weight transfer started, but once it starts, it\u2019s gonna keep going.\u201d I can feel it on the curvy ice roads as the weight shifts from side to side. Once a slide is in progress, the best thing to do is continue giving power even though your brain wants to tell you to take your foot off the gas. That\u2019s actually the worst thing you can do, diGiacomo says, because one of two things will happen: you\u2019ll either lose the slide because it wasn\u2019t initialized enough to begin with, or it will keep rotating around. Applying power allows the front wheels to pull it out of the slide. But I mean, let\u2019s be honest: Who drives a roughly-$700,000 supercar on the ice? That would be crazy. Unless you turn off the electronic stability control, fit it with the right tires, and have a pro telling you exactly when to turn, when to step on the gas, and when to coast (carefully).

        "text": "A five-day mass polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip concluded on Wednesday, reaching nearly 603 000 children under 10 years of age with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) following comprehensive, simultaneous access to all five governorates during the ongoing ceasefire. The campaign was conducted as part of emergency efforts to end an ongoing poliovirus outbreak and prevent further spread in the Gaza Strip. During this round, an additional 40 000 children were vaccinated as compared to the previous two rounds conducted in September and October 2024, after poliovirus was detected in the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire enabled health workers to reach more children who had missed vaccinations due to displacement during the phased approach, living in areas that previously required special coordination for access, or being unreachable during the October 2024 round due to insecurity in North Gaza, including Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun. Strong community engagement and awareness of vaccination benefits had maintained high immunization rates in the Gaza Strip, where 89% of children received the third dose of oral polio vaccine in 2023, before the conflict.\u00a0 This round drew upon 1660 vaccination teams, 1242 of which were mobile, and deployed 1242 social mobilizers. Despite bad weather conditions, families welcomed the initiative and brought their children to points where they could receive the polio vaccine. The campaign was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners. As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative\u2019s commitment to mount a robust poliovirus outbreak response, surveillance for disease in children and for virus circulation in the environment has also been intensified since July 2024. It was this timely surveillance that detected ongoing environmental circulation of the virus, and the need to conduct additional vaccination to protect children. As the ceasefire provides an opportunity to resume critical public health functions, working to recover Gaza\u2019s previously strong disease surveillance and routine immunization are the best ways to protect children from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Ending polio hinges on fully vaccinating every last child with polio vaccines.\u00a0 Ensuring uninterrupted access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and proper nutrition will protect children from many diseases including polio. WHO, UNICEF and partners continue to call for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term health and peace. Media Contacts WHO Media Team World Health Organization UNICEF Media  Related News",

        "text": "Ahead of World Hearing Day 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are highlighting the first global standard for safe listening in video gameplay and esport activities, which aims to reduce the risk of and prevent hearing loss among gamers. Previously, no safe listening guidelines or standards existed for video gameplay devices or software. \u201cEveryone can take steps today to ensure good hearing health throughout their life,\u201d said Dr J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Communicable and Noncommunicable Diseases. \u201cThe WHO/ITU safe listening standard supports governments, manufacturers, civil society, and other stakeholders to foster safe listening environments, so that\u202fpeople of all ages can protect their ears and hearing, and even\u202fwhen playing video games, do not risk hearing loss.\u201d Video gameplay and esports are rapidly becoming one of the largest entertainment industries worldwide. About 3 billion people play video games on devices such as personal computers, video game consoles, and mobile phones, yet most devices and games lack safe listening features to protect users from harmful noise. However, gamers risk permanent hearing loss from prolonged exposure to loud sounds while gaming or listening to music. Children are particularly vulnerable due to their lower sound tolerance and growing interest in gaming. Through the provision of information, warnings and safe listening features, the new standard aims to inform video game players of the risk to hearing loss from loud video gameplay activities and raise awareness about how they can practice safe listening. \u201cAs video gaming and esports continue to grow and gamers use a wider array of devices to access their content, safe listening standards are vital to help protect the hearing of users, especially children, from sounds which could damage their hearing,\u201d said Seizo Onoe, Director, Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, International Telecommunication Union. \u201cCreating effective technical standards requires\u202fcollaboration which leverages each other's strengths. We are grateful to our partners at WHO for their insight and experience advancing safe listening, and are pleased to launch this update on World Hearing Day.\u201d The WHO-ITU Global standard on safe listening for video gameplay and esports is designed to protect hearing for all types of video game players, across a wide range of gameplay scenarios and equipment. The standard provides separate guidelines for video gameplay devices (video game consoles, handheld or mobile devices and personal computers, headphones and headsets), and video game software.

        "text": "What started as a grassroots initiative by a WHO staff member has grown into a global movement for health. Building on the success of the 1 Dollar 1 World campaign, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now amplifying and evolving the initiative to encourage more people around the world to show their solidarity. Inspired by an individual\u2019s initiative, WHO is now backing the 1 Dollar 1 World movement, encouraging regions, countries, champions, and its own workforce to unite behind the effort. Together with the WHO Foundation, WHO will strengthen its efforts to create awareness about its critical work and engage communities worldwide. With this initiative, WHO is embracing a new approach by leveraging crowdfunding to support its mission. For the first time, WHO is activating its existing infrastructure \u2013 spanning 150 country offices \u2013 alongside the WHO Foundation\u2019s reach, to amplify this grassroots movement. This strategic shift not only strengthens community engagement but also aligns with WHO\u2019s broader strategy to diversify funding sources and support its ongoing Investment Round. Since its launch in early 2025, almost 5000 people from over 140 countries have contributed to the campaign through the WHO Foundation, created to bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of WHO. The high level of success and engagement demonstrates that there is a broad sense of solidarity and shared commitment to global health. This campaign is not just about crowdfunding \u2013 it\u2019s about people standing together to remind us that health is a right, not a privilege. \u201cThe power of the 1 Dollar, 1 World movement comes from the people. In particular, I would like to thank my colleague Tania Cernuschi for her inspiration to launch this initiative,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cIt shows that in times of crisis, people everywhere can unite and commit to protecting and promoting the health of others. WHO is proud to stand behind this initiative, which embodies the values of solidarity, action, innovation and hope.\u201d The challenges global health has faced in recent years \u2013 from pandemics to humanitarian crises \u2013 make it clearer than ever that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement is a chance for people everywhere to turn concern into action and show that solidarity, just like health, knows no borders. \u201cThis campaign started with one person, but it belongs to all of us,\u201d said Tania Cernuschi, the WHO staff member who launched the original initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s proof that individuals can make a difference, and that together, we are stronger.\u201d Media and the public are invited to support and share this movement. Every action \u2013 whether a donation, a post, or a conversation \u2013 helps spread the message that health should be for all, not just for some. Every stakeholder \u2013 whether a person, an organization, a community or a government \u2013 has a role in building efficient and effective collaboration for health. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement invites everyone to take action for global health in three simple ways: All donations, collected by the WHO Foundation, support lifesaving efforts around the world, with a strong focus on country-level initiatives. These resources are essential in driving impactful implementation where it matters most based on the decisions of WHO\u2019s 194 Member States. Together, we can drive real change.

        "text": "The emergency polio outbreak response in the Gaza Strip is continuing, with a mass vaccination campaign scheduled from 22 to 26 February 2025. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk. Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection. Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region. In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now. No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024. The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April. The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners. Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak. WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital have commenced distribution of critically-needed childhood cancer medicines in 2 of 6 pilot countries, through the Global Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines. Currently, these medicines are being delivered to Mongolia and Uzbekistan, with next shipments planned for Ecuador, Jordan, Nepal and Zambia. The treatments are expected to reach approximately 5000 children with cancer across at least 30 hospitals in these countries within this year. The Global Platform is a first initiative of its kind. Countries in the pilot phase will receive an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines at no cost. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), childhood cancer survival rates are often below 30%, significantly lower than those in high-income countries. Six additional countries have been formally invited to join the platform. The initiative is poised to become the largest, with the goal of reaching 50 nations in the next 5 to 7 years. It aims to eventually provide medicines for the treatment of approximately 120 000 children with cancer in LMICs, significantly reducing mortality rates. \u201cFor too long, children with cancer have lacked access to life-saving medicines,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cThis unique partnership between WHO and St. Jude is working to provide quality-assured cancer medicines to paediatric hospitals in low-and middle-income countries. WHO is proud to be part of this joint initiative with St. Jude, bringing health and hope to children around the world.\u201d Every year, an estimated 400 000 children worldwide develop cancer. The majority of these children, living in resource-limited settings, are unable to consistently obtain or afford cancer medicines. It is estimated that 70% of the children from these settings die from cancer due to factors such as lack of appropriate treatment, treatment disruptions or low-quality medicines. \u201cA child\u2019s chances of surviving cancer are largely determined by where they are born, making this one of the starkest disparities in global healthcare,\u201d said James R. Downing, MD, president and CEO of St. Jude. \u201cSt. Jude was founded on Danny Thomas\u2019 dream that no child should die in the dawn of life. By developing this platform, we believe this dream can someday be achieved for children stricken by cancer, irrespective of where they live.\u201d St. Jude and WHO announced the platform in 2021 to ensure children around the world have access to lifesaving treatments. The platform brings together governments, the pharmaceutical industry and non-governmental organizations in a unique collaborative model focused on creating solutions for children with cancer. The co-design approach addresses the broader needs of national stakeholders, with a focus on capacity building and long-term sustainability. The platform provides comprehensive end-to-end support, from consolidating global demand to shaping the market, assisting countries with medicine selection and developing treatment standards. It represents a transformative model for the broader global health community working together to tackle health challenges, in particular for children and noncommunicable diseases. To accomplish this, St. Jude and WHO partner with UNICEF Supply Division, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Strategic Fund. World Health Organization Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. WHO is the UN agency for health that connects nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations \u2013 leading the world\u2019s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. WHO\u2019s mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. On childhood cancer, WHO works with over 100 global partners through the\u00a0Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer, to support governments in developing high-quality cancer centres and regional satellites that ensure early, accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for children with cancer. WHO also develops standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for diagnosis, treatment and palliative and survivorship care. Progress on childhood cancer, as well as on other noncommunicable diseases, are part of the agenda for the UN General Assembly Fourth\u00a0High-Level Meeting of the on noncommunicable diseases to take place in September 2025. St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and other life-threatening disorders. It is a non-profit organization based in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, and the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at\u202fSt. Jude\u202fhave helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to 80% since the hospital opened more than 60 years ago.\u202fSt. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes\u202fto help doctors and researchers at local hospitals and cancer centers around the world improve the quality of treatment and care for even more children.\u202fTo learn more, visit stjude.org,\u202fread Progress: A Digital Magazine and follow St. Jude on social media at\u202f@stjuderesearch.

        "title": "\r\n\tDire health and humanitarian crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo prompts escalation of efforts by WHO, partners\r\n",
        "text": "The recent surge in violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to significant loss of life, trauma, displacement, and the destruction of critical health infrastructure, exacerbating an already dire situation for millions of people. The situation remains tense and volatile, and the health needs are immense. WHO remains on the ground, and has continued to respond to the health needs by providing lifesaving medical supplies, supporting health workers, and coordinating the emergency response. Hospitals and morgues are overwhelmed. Since 26\u00a0January, 3082 injured and 843 dead have been reported from 31 health facilities in and around Goma, North Kivu. With the alarming expansion of violence further south, 65 injuries were reported from 3 hospitals in South Kivu. These numbers are expected to rise further as more injured people are able to reach health facilities and more dead bodies are gathered off the streets. Wound infections are a risk for those who have not been able to reach health care facilities quickly, and as health facilities are running out of supplies they need to clean and disinfect. The sight of bodies lying uncared for is distressing. Though the bodies of people who have died from injury do not generally carry or spread disease, it is the right of the dead to be identified and receive proper burial, and important for the living to know their loved ones have received this care. Over 70 (or 6%) of the health facilities in North Kivu have been affected, with some completely destroyed and others struggling to restart operations. Some ambulances have also been damaged. A WHO-supported health clinic in North Kivu was temporarily occupied by armed groups. Health workers have had to flee in places, while in others, they have been working round the clock for days, with limited resources and overwhelming demand, and sometimes at risk to their own lives. Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and other routine services are also affected as medicines have run out and health workers are either absent or overburdened. The risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth has increased from already high levels. Given the insecurity, pregnant women cannot reach health facilities for safe delivery. Experience with conflict in the region has shown the drastic effect it has, with the rate of births attended to by skilled health workers dropping to near zero during periods of intense violence. The threat of infectious diseases has multiplied. Cholera, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox and tuberculosis are among the infectious threats in the area. The water supply in Goma was disrupted and has only partially resumed, leading people to use water from the lake, and heightening the risk of cholera spread. Close to 600 suspected cases of cholera and 14 deaths were reported from North Kivu between 1 and 27 January. Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially South Kivu province, is the epicentre of the mpox outbreak that prompted the WHO Director-General to declare a public health emergency of international concern last August. The mpox response is heavily impacted. Ninety percent of the mpox patients (128 of 143) in isolation units in Goma had fled for safety, making it nearly impossible to provide them with care, and increasing the risk of spread. One in four people in the region was already facing emergency levels of hunger, with the recent violence expected to worsen the situation. Malnutrition and disease go hand-in-hand: malnourished people are less able to fight disease, while disease leads to further malnutrition. This vicious circle is especially concerning when it comes to children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Goma was home to over 2 million people, including 700\u00a0000 people displaced by this crisis. These people have had to flee yet again, in search of safety. They are in temporary settlements, with their health and safety at risk. A rapid assessment of 10 healthcare facilities in and around Goma showed a concerning rise in rape and other gender-based violence: there were 45 cases reported among the displaced, and 21 survivors of gang-rape admitted to two hospitals. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg. These patients require medical care, psychological support, and support with maintaining their livelihood, especially when they are the sole providers for their families. WHO has deployed emergency medical supplies, hygiene and water treatment supplies, and tents to increase hospital capacity by 1000 beds. Supplies are being depleted rapidly, and more resources are urgently needed. WHO is preparing further deliveries as part a European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)-led effort to fly in critical supplies. For this, the Goma airport, a critical lifeline, must be urgently reopened. WHO is also exploring options to deliver critical supplies through other routes. WHO and partners were able to resume mpox vaccination in Goma on Wednesday, 5\u00a0February after a 10 day pause. The United States\u2019 recent decision to freeze foreign aid is significantly impacting relief efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year, the US contributed to as much as 70% of the country\u2019s humanitarian response. Additionally, the US is a major funder of the mpox response, and has pledged a million vaccine doses of its own stock to global efforts. While WHO\u2019s humanitarian response in the region relies on funding from other donors\u2014including the European Union, United Kingdom and the WHO\u2019s Contingency Fund for Emergencies\u2014reductions in overall aid will have repercussions on people\u2019s health. To meet immediate health needs in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, including for safe and dignified burials, WHO has spent US$\u00a0600\u00a0000. The overall response requires US$ 50 million. WHO calls for humanitarian access, the protection of health workers and facilities, and an end to attacks on health care. Health facilities, supplies, workers and patients should be protected. Ultimately, we call for peace, and an end to the unimaginable and long suffering of the people in this region.

        "title": "\r\n\tStrengthening alliances and building movements to end female genital mutilation\r\n",
        "text": "Female genital mutilation is a violation of human rights that inflicts deep and lifelong physical, emotional and psychological scars on girls and women. This harmful practice affects more than 230\u00a0million girls and women today. An estimated 27\u00a0million more girls could endure this violation of their rights and dignity by 2030 if we do not take action now. Today, on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, and in response to the theme \"Stepping up the pace: Strengthening alliances and building movements to end female genital mutilation\", UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO reaffirm our commitment to work together with countries and communities to end this harmful practice \u2013 once and for all. There is hope. Many countries have seen a decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation. We are witnessing progress in countries like Kenya and Uganda, where collaborative action and community-led initiatives are proving that by strengthening alliances and building movements, we can accelerate change. Since the launch of the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation in 2008, and in collaboration with WHO, close to 7\u00a0million girls and women access prevention and protection services. Additionally, 48\u00a0million people have made public declarations to abandon the practice, and 220\u00a0million individuals were reached by mass media messaging on the issue. In the last two years, close to 12\u00a0000 grassroots organizations and 112\u00a0000 community and frontline workers galvanized to effect change at this critical juncture. Yet the fragility of progress made has also become starkly evident. In the Gambia, for example, attempts to repeal the ban on female genital mutilation persist, even after an initial proposal to do so was rejected by its parliament last year. Such efforts could gravely undermine the rights, health and dignity of future generations of girls and women, jeopardizing the tireless work over decades to change attitudes and mobilize communities. Of the 31 countries in which data on prevalence are collected nationally, only seven countries are on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of ending female genital mutilation by or before 2030. The current rate of progress must accelerate urgently to meet this target. This requires strengthened alliances among leaders, grassroots organizations and across sectors spanning health, education and social protection \u2013 as well as sustained advocacy and expanded social movements with girls and survivors at the centre. It demands greater accountability at all levels to ensure commitments to human rights are upheld and policies and strategies are implemented to protect girls at risk and provide care, including justice, for survivors. It also requires increased investment in scaling up proven interventions. We are indebted to generous donors and partners who are supporting this life-changing work and call on others to join them. We all have a role to play to ensure that every girl is protected and can live free from harm. Let\u2019s step up the pace and act with urgency. The time to end female genital mutilation is now.  Notes to Editors About the UNFPA\u2013UNICEF Joint ProgrammeThe UNFPA\u2013UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation: Delivering the Global Promise works to eliminate female genital mutilation through interventions in 17 countries where the practice is prevalent.

        "text": "In a global first, Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners today launched a first-ever clinical efficacy trial for a vaccine from Ebola from the Sudan species of the virus, and at an unprecedented speed for a randomized vaccine trial, in an emergency. This is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola Sudan virus disease. IAVI, the provider of the vaccine, conducted trials for safety and immunogenicity. It is also the first clinical trial of the vaccine during an outbreak. The principal investigators\u00a0from Makerere University and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), with support from WHO and other partners, have worked tirelessly to get the trial ready in 4 days since the outbreak was confirmed on 30 January. It is the first trial to assess the clinical efficacy of a vaccine against Ebola disease due to Sudan virus. The speed was achieved through advanced research preparedness, while ensuring full compliance with national and international regulatory and ethical requirements. The candidate vaccine was donated by IAVI, with financial support from WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and support from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). \u201cThis is a critical achievement towards better pandemic preparedness, and saving lives when outbreaks occur,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\u2019s Director-General.\u00a0 \u201cThis is possible because of the dedication of Uganda\u2019s health workers, the involvement of communities, the Ministry of Health of Uganda, Makerere University and UVRI, and research efforts led by WHO involving hundreds of scientists through our research and development Filoviruses network. We thank our partners for their dedication and cooperation, from IAVI for donating the vaccine, to CEPI, EU HERA and Canada\u2019s IDRC for funding, and Africa CDC for further support. This massive achievement would simply not be possible without them.\u201d In 2022, during the previous outbreak of Ebola disease (also from the Sudan species of the virus) in Uganda, a randomized protocol for candidate vaccines was developed. Principal investigators were designated under the leadership of the Minister of Health, and teams were trained to allow such a trial to take place during an active outbreak. The randomized vaccine trial to assess the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) candidate vaccine was launched\u00a0at a ceremony in Kampala today by the Minister of Health of Uganda. WHO is co-sponsoring the trial. WHO was represented by Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme and Deputy Director-General, and the WHO representative to Uganda Dr Kasonde Mwinga, along with other colleagues. Three vaccination rings were defined today. The first ring involves about 40 contacts and contacts of contacts of the first reported and confirmed case, a health worker who has died. Although several promising candidate medical countermeasures are progressing through clinical development, as of now, there is no licensed vaccine available to effectively combat a potential future outbreak of Ebola disease from the Sudan species of the virus. Licensed vaccines exist only for the disease caused by Ebola virus, formerly known as Za\u00efre ebolavirus. Likewise for treatments, approved treatments are only available for Ebola virus. The vaccine for the trial was recommended by the independent WHO candidate vaccine prioritization working group. If the candidate vaccine is effective, it can contribute to controlling this outbreak and generate data for vaccine licensure. In 2022, the research teams were trained in good clinical practice (GCP) and standard operating procedures for such trials. They completed refresher training in recent days. WHO colleagues experienced in trials and in ring vaccination arrived in Uganda over the weekend to support the trial implementation and GCP compliance. The vaccine doses were pre-positioned in the country. WHO worked with the principal investigators and national authorities and the vaccine developer to review cold chain documentation and ensure the doses were stored correctly over the previous years. As part of the signed agreement with the Ministry of Health, WHO has a signed agreement with IAVI for additional doses of the candidate vaccine to be made available shortly. Notes to editors The trial is a ring vaccination cluster randomized trial designed to assess the effect of one single, promptly given, dose of the candidate vaccine whose safety and immunogenicity have already been demonstrated in Phase 1, in protecting recent contacts and contacts of contacts of a newly confirmed case of Sudan virus disease (SVD). Ring vaccination consists of the targeted vaccination of the recent contacts of an index case.\u00a0It might protect the individual vaccinated or help create a small buffer zone of immunized\u00a0people that could limit propagation of the infection. The ring vaccination trial involves a population at increased risk of infection as they have recently been in contact with a case of SVD, so it may well provide useful information about the protection of such case-contacts quickly, within just a few months. The same study design was used in the Ebola \u00e7a suffit trial in Guinea in 2015 by WHO and the Ministry of Health of Guinea to evaluate a now-licensed vaccine against a different species of ebolavirus. On 4 February 2025, a correction was made to the opening sentence of this news release as noted below. The sentence in the original news release read: In a global first, Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners today launched a first ever vaccine trial for Ebola from the Sudan species of the virus, and at an unprecedented speed for a randomized vaccine trial in an emergency.

        "text": "WHO and partners have immediately boosted their support to the Ugandan government\u2019s response to an outbreak of Sudan virus disease outbreak (SVD, part of the Ebola family), including by facilitating access to a candidate vaccine and candidate treatments. The first 2160 doses of the vaccine candidate and the treatments are already in Kampala, Uganda, as they were prepositioned as part of outbreak preparedness. The vaccine trial processes underway include orientation of the research teams on the trial procedures, and logistics arrangements. Research teams have been deployed to the field to work along with the surveillance teams as approvals are awaited. The candidate vaccine and the candidate treatments (a monoclonal antibody and an antiviral) are being made available through clinical trial protocols, which will make it possible to further document their efficacy and safety. As of 30 January, there was one confirmed case and 45 contacts who are being followed up. Uganda has experienced five previous SVD outbreaks. The last one was declared in September 2022 and ended in January 2023, with 164 cases and 77 deaths. During that outbreak, a WHO committee of external experts evaluated candidate vaccines and provided recommendations on their suitability for evaluation in Uganda, as part of a clinical trial against the SVD virus. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health of Uganda and its designated Ugandan Principal Investigators and their teams from Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, as well as worldwide filovirus and trial experts and regulators, to initiate the trials. The trials were designed via a global collaborative effort coordinated by WHO, that included developers, academic institutions, regulatory authorities, other experts and researchers from Uganda and other countries at risk of filoviruses outbreaks. The aim of the vaccine trial is to evaluate a potentially efficacious candidate vaccine, and if efficacious, to possibly contribute to ending the ongoing outbreak and protect populations at risk in the future. Those eligible to join the trial are those at highest risk of SVD, i.e. close contacts of a person who has been confirmed to have had SVD or who has died from the disease. The study sites will therefore be the locations where contacts of the case or cases reside. Study teams will be mobile and able to rapidly move to these areas to do their work using the ring vaccination approach. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and with Makerere University Lung Institute and the Ugandan Virus Research Institute, who will lead the trials\u2019 implementation. The development of the protocols and research priorities has been done via the MARVAC Consortium and the Collaborative Open Research Consortium (CORC) for the Filoviridae Family, and numerous developers facilitated the availability of the candidate vaccine and treatments: IAVI provided their candidate Sudan vaccine, Gilead provided remdesivir, an antiviral. Among those supporting the trials\u2019 implementation are the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre, the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and WHO. This rapid action is the result of tireless efforts to build international cooperation on research, innovation and evaluation and deployment of countermeasures in the face of dangerous pathogens. While outbreaks of SVD are controllable without vaccines, control can be achieved more quickly using safe and effective vaccines. In the meantime, a comprehensive outbreak response is underway in Uganda to rapidly halt transmission, identify contacts and carry out epidemiological investigations, while enhancing community awareness. WHO has allocated US$ 1 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to help accelerate outbreak control efforts. Sudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates that is due to Orthoebolavirus sudanense (Sudan virus), a viral species belonging to the same genus of the virus causing Ebola virus disease.\u00a0 Case fatality rates of Sudan virus disease have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks. There are no approved treatments or vaccines for Sudan virus, but early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Sudan virus disease.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates Niger for having met the criteria for onchocerciasis elimination, making it the fifth country globally and the first country in Africa to be acknowledged by WHO for interrupting transmission of the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. Eliminating a disease is a significant achievement that requires tireless dedication,\u201d stated Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cI congratulate Niger for its commitment to liberating its population from this blinding, stigmatizing illness that causes so much human suffering among the poorest. This success is yet another testament to the remarkable strides we have made against neglected tropical diseases and offers hope to other nations still battling onchocerciasis, demonstrating that elimination is possible.\u201d Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, is a parasitic disease and is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, after trachoma. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infective black flies, primarily found in riverine areas. The disease primarily affects rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa and Yemen, with smaller endemic areas found in parts of Latin America. Between 1976 and 1989, under the umbrella of the WHO Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP), Niger undertook vector control measures by spraying insecticides that significantly decreased levels of onchocerciasis transmission. Following the donation of ivermectin by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme (MSD), areas still affected by lymphatic filariasis (LF) underwent mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin and albendazole from 2008 to 2019, followed by surveillance. Since ivermectin is effective against both diseases, and areas targeted for LF MDA were also endemic for onchocerciasis, this intervention also contributed to interrupting the transmission of the Onchocerca volvulus parasite. Niger started preliminary assessments on interruption of onchocerciasis transmission in 2014 after stopping LF MDA in most areas. This was followed by entomological and epidemiological surveys which revealed that the combination of medicine and vector control had successfully eliminated transmission of onchocerciasis, as evidenced by the reduction in prevalence from approximately 60% to 0.02%. In addition to the vector control interventions and the medicines donated by MSD, a key factor contributing to Niger\u2019s success is the partnership between the Nigerien government, WHO and nongovernmental organizations, which has helped mobilize resources and technical support. Continuous monitoring of the disease\u2019s prevalence and its impact has enabled timely adjustments in strategies and ensured the effectiveness of interventions. \u201cOnchocerciasis has long caused immense human suffering. It has also impeded the economic development of affected communities, driving people away from rivers, which are often lifelines for livelihoods,\u201d says Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \u201cNiger\u2019s success ends this burden for its people. It also positions Niger as a model for the elimination of neglected tropical diseases in Africa. The country previously demonstrated its leadership in public health, by eliminating Guinea-worm disease in 2013. Today, it takes another historic step forward.\u201d Globally, 54 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Niger joins four other countries that have been verified by WHO for eliminating onchocerciasis, all in the Region of the Americas: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Guatemala (2016) and Mexico (2015). In the WHO African Region, 21 countries have eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Onchocerciasis is the second neglected tropical disease eliminated in Niger: the country was certified free of dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease) transmission in 2013.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) congratulates Guinea for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem. This form of human African trypanosomiasis, the only type transmitted in Guinea, is the first neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in the country. The news marks an important achievement in this public health field on the eve of the world Neglected Tropical Diseases Day, marked on 30 January. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is both a testament to the global progress against neglected tropical diseases and a beacon of hope for nations still battling human African trypanosomiasis,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by infected tsetse flies. Symptoms include fever, headaches, joint pain and, in advanced stages, neurological symptoms like confusion, disrupted sleep patterns and behavioural changes. In the 1990s, HAT resurged along Guinea\u2019s coast due to increased human activity in mangroves, driven by Conakry\u2019s economic and population growth. In response to the critical threat posed by HAT, Guinea\u2019s Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene established the National Programme for the Control of HAT in 2002, with support from WHO and the Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), and later from partners such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and the Institut Pasteur de Guin\u00e9e. The programme began with mass medical screenings to diagnose and treat cases effectively, marking a crucial step in controlling the disease. The programme introduced vector control interventions in 2012 aiming to interrupt contact between people and tsetse flies. Initially implemented in the Boffa-East area, this strategy expanded nationwide by 2016, with nearly 15\u00a0000 impregnated mini-screens (with insecticides to attract and kill the tsetse flies) deployed annually. However, Guinea faced significant challenges in its HAT elimination efforts during the Ebola outbreak and COVID-19. From 2013 to 2015, the Ebola epidemic caused a suspension of medical activities, leading to a resurgence in HAT cases. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic posed further disruptions, but the programme adapted by implementing door-to-door HAT screening to maintain control efforts. Collaboration with local communities played a critical role throughout these years, ensuring that interventions were culturally acceptable and widely supported. Advances in diagnostic techniques, treatment delivery, and consistent financial and technical backing from WHO and other partners bolstered the programme\u2019s impact. As a result, Guinea successfully reduced the number of HAT cases to below the WHO threshold of 1 case per 10\u00a0000 inhabitants in all endemic areas, achieving a major milestone in its fight against this neglected tropical disease. \u201cThe elimination of sleeping sickness is the result of many years of effort by the Guinean government, its partners and communities in the overall context of the national policy to combat all neglected tropical diseases,\u201d said Dr Oumar Diouh\u00e9 BAH, Guinea's Minister of Health and Public Hygiene. \u201cThe elimination of human African trypanosomiasis by Guinea is a significant public health achievement. Vulnerable families and communities can now live free of the threat posed by this potentially fatal disease,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \u201cI congratulate the government, health workers, partners and communities for this crucial milestone. \u201cWHO remains committed to supporting countries to eliminate human African trypanosomiasis and other neglected tropical diseases in Africa.\u201d With Guinea, seven other countries have been validated by WHO for eliminating the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis: Togo (2020), Benin (2021), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (2021), Uganda (2022), Equatorial Guinea (2022), Ghana (2023) and Chad (2024). The rhodesiense form of the disease has been eliminated as a public health problem in one country, Rwanda, as validated by WHO in 2022. Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. These parasites are passed to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies, which acquire the infection from humans or animals carrying the pathogenic parasites. There are two forms of the disease: one caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, found in 24 countries in West and Central Africa and which accounts for more than 92% of cases; and another caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, found in 13 countries in East and Southern Africa accounting for the remaining cases. The main approaches to controlling sleeping sickness include reducing the reservoirs of infection and reducing the presence of the tsetse fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients earlier in the disease development. If diagnosis is made early, it is possible to avoid complicated and risky treatment procedures during the advanced stage, and to improve the cure prognosis.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) expresses deep concern about the implications of the immediate funding pause for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries. These programmes provide access to life-saving HIV therapy to more than 30\u00a0million people worldwide. Globally, 39.9\u00a0million people were living with HIV at the end of 2023. A funding halt for HIV programmes can put people living with HIV at immediate increased risk of illness and death and undermine efforts to prevent transmission in communities and countries. Such measures, if prolonged, could lead to rises in new infections and deaths, reversing decades of progress and potentially taking the world back to the 1980s and 1990s when millions died of HIV every year globally, including many in the United States of America. For the global community, this could result in significant setbacks to progress in partnerships and investments in scientific advances that have been the cornerstone of good public health programming, including innovative diagnostics, affordable medicines, and community delivery models of HIV care. We call on the United States Government to enable additional exemptions to ensure the delivery of lifesaving HIV treatment and care. The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\u00a0(PEPFAR) has been a flagship initiative of the global HIV response since its establishment over 20 years ago. The current funding pause for PEPFAR will have a direct impact on millions of lives that depend on the predictable supply of safe and effective antiretroviral treatment. PEPFAR works in over 50 countries around the world. Over the past two decades, PEPFAR funding has saved more than 26\u00a0million lives. Currently, PEPFAR is providing HIV treatment for more than 20\u00a0million people living with HIV globally, including 566\u00a0000 children under 15 years of age. Over the past year, PEPFAR and partners, including WHO, have been working on sustainability plans with countries for greater country ownership and reduced donor support up to and beyond 2030. A sudden and prolonged stop to programmes does not allow for a managed transition and puts the lives of millions at risk. WHO is committed to support PEPFAR and other partners, as well as national governments, in managing change processes effectively to minimize the impact on people living with HIV.

        "text": "Following a nearly century-long effort, Georgia has been certified malaria-free by the World Health Organization (WHO). With today\u2019s announcement, Georgia joins the ranks of 45 countries and 1 territory that have achieved this milestone. \u201cToday we congratulate the people of Georgia for their decades of targeted and sustained actions to eliminate malaria, one of the world\u2019s leading killers,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s commitment and success gives us hope that a malaria-free world is possible.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge milestone worth marking; with Georgia\u2019s achievement, the WHO European Region is another step closer to initiate certification as the first malaria-free region in the world,\u201d said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, this was made possible thanks to sustained investment, dedication of the health workforce and targeted efforts in prevention, early detection and effective treatment of all malaria cases.\u201d Certification of malaria elimination is granted by WHO when a country has proven, beyond reasonable doubt, that the chain of indigenous transmission has been interrupted nationwide for at least the previous three consecutive years. The Minister of Health, Mikheil Sarjveladze, noted that certifying Georgia as malaria-free is a recognition of the sustainability of its healthcare system, \u201cthis success means that Georgia can address important health challenges.\" Malaria has plagued Georgia since ancient times. Before the introduction of systematic control efforts in the early 1900s, at least 3 malaria parasite species\u2014P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. vivax\u2014were endemic in the country. In the 1920s, an estimated 30% of the population suffered from malaria caused by the P. vivax malaria species. By 1940, large-scale mosquito control programmes had helped reduce malaria cases significantly through improved access to diagnostic and treatment facilities. A few years later, however, World War II caused a surge again due to population movement and the strain on health facilities. In the post-war period, Georgia launched an intensive programme aimed at eliminating malaria, using newer medicines, insecticide spraying and robust entomological surveillance. The campaign successfully interrupted the transmission of P. falciparum by 1953, P. malariae by 1960 and P. vivax by 1970. Georgia remained malaria-free for 25 years, but by 2002, malaria had reemerged in the country with 474 cases reported. In 2005, together with 9 other countries in the WHO European Region, Georgia signed the Tashkent Declaration, reaffirming its pledge to eliminate malaria. The intensified interventions that followed significantly reduced malaria incidence in Georgia, with the last indigenous case recorded in 2009. By 2015, all 53 countries of the WHO European Region, including Georgia, reported zero indigenous cases of malaria. To prevent further re-establishment of malaria transmission in the region, the original signatories of the Tashkent Declaration issued the Ashgabat Statement in 2017 committing to take all efforts to remain malaria-free. T\u00fcrkiye is the only country in the WHO European Region remaining to be certified. In 2024, during the Georgia\u2019s malaria-free certification process, members of the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification, an independent WHO advisory body, noted that Georgia has a well-functioning and adequately resourced health system, strong public-private cooperation, and political commitment to maintaining a malaria-free status. WHO malaria-free certification The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification is made by the WHO Director-General, based on a recommendation by the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification and validation from the Malaria Policy Advisory Group.

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the Gaza ceasefire, hostage and prisoner release deal, which brings hope for millions of people whose lives have been ravaged by the conflict. The health challenges ahead are immense. The entire population of Gaza has faced multiple displacements. More than 46 600 people have been killed and over 110 000 have been injured. The real figures are likely much higher. Only half of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals remain partially operational, nearly all hospitals are damaged or partly destroyed, and just 38% of primary health care centres are functional. An estimated 25% of those injured \u2013 around 30 000 people \u2013 face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation. Specialized health care is largely unavailable, medical evacuations abroad are extremely slow. Transmission of infectious diseases has massively increased, malnutrition is rising, and the risk of famine persists. The breakdown of public order, exacerbated by armed gangs, raises further concerns. Addressing the massive needs and restoring the health system will be an extremely complex and challenging task, given the scale of destruction, operational complexity and constraints involved. Billions in investment are needed to support recovery of the health system, which will require the unwavering commitment of donors and the international community. WHO is ready to scale up the response together with UN health partners including UNFPA, UNICEF, UNRWA and 67 Health Cluster partners. However, it is critical that the security obstacles hindering operations are removed. WHO will need conditions on the ground that allow systematic access to the population across Gaza, enabling the influx of aid via all possible borders and routes, and lifting restrictions on the entry of essential items. Also essential are active protection of civilians and health-care workers, expediting medical evacuations through all possible routes for over 12 000 patients (and their companions) who urgently require specialized care, strengthening and speeding up the referral system to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and addressing road repairs, rubble removal, and the remediation of unexploded ordnances. WHO and partners will need a massive scale-up of funding to meet immediate health needs, and to begin to restore the heath system, including the workforce, supply chain and infrastructure. WHO and partners will implement a 60-day plan to support the urgent restoration and expansion of the health system. Focus will be on key priority response areas, including trauma and emergency care, comprehensive primary health care, child health, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), rehabilitation, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). Given the immense needs, WHO is scaling up operations and mobilizing critical supplies and resources for delivery into Gaza. A priority will be the assessment and rehabilitation of partially damaged health facilities in high-need areas. Work is ongoing to urgently increase bed capacity across selected hospitals in northern and southern Gaza, together with the expansion of operational capacities, supporting the hiring and redistribution of national health workers, and increasing deployment of international health workers to fill gaps. Plans are underway to integrate prefabricated clinics and hospitals with existing health facilities to enhance service delivery in underserved and newly accessible areas. Efforts also are underway to strengthen referral processes for critical care within Gaza and facilitate cross-border medical evacuations. Given the high level of malnutrition and disease outbreaks, WHO is working with partners to expand infant and young child feeding programmes, enhance immunization efforts and reinforce disease surveillance systems for timely prevention, reporting, and outbreak management. WHO calls on all parties to uphold their commitment to fully implement the ceasefire agreement and to continue working towards a political solution to address the protracted crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory, which is essential for lasting peace.

In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for US$ 1.5 billion for its 2025 Health Emergency Appeal (HEA), to support life-saving health interventions worldwide. The appeal, launched today by WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outlines the critical priorities and resources needed to address 42 ongoing health emergencies, including 17 Grade 3 crises \u2013 the most severe emergencies requiring the highest level of response. With health systems stretched to their limits and global financial resources dwindling, the US$ 1.5 billion are needed to help people facing the most difficult situations \u201cConflicts, outbreaks, climate-related disasters and other health emergencies are no longer isolated or occasional \u2013 they are relentless, overlapping and intensifying,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"From controlling cholera outbreaks to providing mental health support in conflict zones, WHO\u2019s work extends beyond the immediate care we provide. We empower communities to protect themselves, prioritize equity, and build a legacy of preparedness. This appeal is about enabling WHO to save lives, protect the right to health, and provide hope where there is none.\u201d WHO is committed to delivering emergency health assistance, including in conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the occupied Palestinian territory and Sudan. WHO\u2019s response in emergencies is aligned with wider humanitarian efforts and prioritizes providing essential care and medical supplies; treating malnutrition and supporting maternal and child health; conducting vaccination campaigns to prevent disease outbreaks; and offering mental health support to populations impacted by trauma. The Appeal highlights four key challenges facing the world currently: \u00a0climate change, conflict, displacement and disease outbreaks. These are responsible for fueling deeper, longer lasting health crises and putting the world\u2019s most vulnerable at greater risk. The appeal further details the priorities and financial needs for each of the Grade 3 emergencies that WHO is responding to. With the support of donors and partners, WHO aims to fulfill its unique role in health emergencies, while upholding the principles of international humanitarian law, ensuring that no one is left behind even in the most challenging circumstances. This appeal is about more than just funding \u2013 it is a call to action. As crises grow more frequent and severe, the gap between global needs and available resources continues to widen.

        "text": "On 18 December 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified the first diagnostic test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency which can help to safely deliver WHO-recommended treatments to prevent relapse of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) infection. The prequalification of this G6PD diagnostic test marks a significant milestone in facilitating safe and effective P. vivax malaria treatment, reaffirming WHO\u2019s dedication to ensuring equitable access to life-saving health solutions globally. Some 500 000 people die each year from malaria, most of them children. The prequalification of this test immediately followed the prequalification, in early December, of two new tafenoquine products for anti-relapse treatment of P. vivax malaria, and these therapeutics were recommended in updated  WHO malaria guidelines released a few days earlier, in late November. This package of actions by WHO reflects the organization\u2019s recent adoption of synchronized and parallel processes for two key functions: developing recommendations for essential health products and overseeing their prequalification. While these processes remain entirely independent, their alignment aims to significantly reduce the time required to bring vital health products to low- and lower-middle-income countries. This streamlined approach underscores WHO\u2019s commitment to improving global health equity by expediting access to life-saving products. P. vivax malaria is endemic in all WHO Regions except the European Region, with an estimated 9.2 million clinical cases occurring in 2023. P. vivax\u00a0is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. G6PD deficiency, a genetic condition, affects more than 500 million people. While most people are unaware of their G6PD deficiency and go through life without suffering ill effects, certain drugs administered to prevent malaria relapse caused by P. vivax can result in acute haemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Without accessible and reliable G6PD testing, it has been challenging to safely provide anti-relapse treatments, limiting the widespread use of this effective therapy. \u201cThe prequalification of this G6PD enzyme test for patients with P. vivax malaria can help countries in enhancing access to much-needed quality-assured tests, enabling safe and effective treatment and prevention of this type of relapsing malaria,\u201d said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. \u201cCurrently, no other prequalification applications are received for this type of tests. We encourage the submission of additional products to expand the range of effective diagnostic tools available to countries in need.\u201d \u201cWider availability of the test can help strengthen the global malaria response by reducing the number of P. vivax infections due to relapse and in turn reduce onward transmission,\u201d said Dr Daniel Ngamije Madandi, Director of WHO\u2019s Global Malaria Programme. Testing devices that can accurately distinguish patients with G6PD activity levels above and below the normal levels provide critical information to clinicians to decide which of P. vivax anti-relapse treatment regimens is most appropriate, including low- and high-dose primaquine and single-dose tafenoquine. The STANDARD G6PD System diagnostic tool manufactured by SD Biosensor, Inc., is a semi-quantitative, near-patient solution designed for the measurement of G6PD enzyme activity in capillary or venous whole blood. The device is intended for use in both laboratory and non-laboratory settings and operates with the STANDARD G6PD Analyzer, a hand-held device, delivering results in a few minutes.

Over the last two months, the area around the hospital has remained highly volatile and attacks on the hospitals and on health workers have occurred almost daily. This week, bombardments in its vicinity reportedly killed 50 people, including five health workers from Kamal Adwan Hospital.Kamal Adwan is now empty. Yesterday evening, the remaining 15 critical patients, 50 caregivers and 20 health workers were transferred to Indonesian Hospital, which lacks the necessary equipment and supplies to provide adequate care. The movement and treatment of these critical patients under such conditions pose grave risks to their survival. WHO is deeply concerned for their wellbeing, as well as for the Kamal Adwan Hospital director who has been reportedly detained during the raid. WHO lost contact with him since the raid began.An urgent WHO mission to Indonesian Hospital is being planned for tomorrow to assess the situation at the facility, provide basic medical supplies, food and water, and safely move critical patients to Gaza City for continued care.The raid on the Kamal Adwan hospital follows escalating restrictions on access and repeated attacks. Since early October 2024, WHO has verified at least 50 attacks on health on or near the hospital. Despite the increasingly dire needs for emergency and trauma services and supplies, only 10 out of 21 WHO missions to Kamal Adwan have been partially facilitated between early October and December. During these missions, 45 000 liters of fuel, medical supplies, blood, and food were delivered, and 114 patients along with 123 companions were transferred to Al-Shifa Hospital. But the deployment of international emergency medical teams has been repeatedly denied. \u00a0WHO and partners' efforts to sustain the hospitals\u2019 operations have been undone. With Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals entirely out of service, and Al-Awda Hospital barely able to function, and severely damaged due to recent airstrikes, the healthcare lifeline for those in North Gaza is reaching a breaking point.\u00a0WHO calls for urgently ensuring that hospitals in North Gaza can be supported to become functional again.\u00a0Hospitals have once again become battlegrounds, reminiscent of the destruction of the health system in Gaza City earlier this year.Since October 2023, WHO has repeatedly issued urgent calls to protect health workers and hospitals as per international humanitarian law \u2014yet these calls remain unheard. Health facilities, workers and patients are always off limits. They must be actively protected and never be attacked, nor used for military purposes. The principles of precaution, distinction and proportionality under International Humanitarian Law are absolute and always apply. WHO is appalled by yesterday\u2019s raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital, which put the last major health facility in North Gaza out of service. The systematic dismantling of the health system and a siege for over 80 days on North Gaza puts the lives of the 75,000 Palestinians remaining in the area at risk. Initial reports indicate that some areas of the hospital were burnt and severely damaged during the raid, including the laboratory, surgical unit, engineering and maintenance department, operations theatre, and the medical store. Earlier in the day, twelve patients and a female health staff were reportedly forced to evacuate to destroyed and non-functional Indonesian Hospital where it is not possible to provide any care, while the majority of the staff, stable patients and companions were moved to a nearby location.

        "title": "\r\n\tStatement on the antigen composition of COVID-19 vaccines\r\n",
        "text": "The WHO  Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) continues to \u00a0closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. Based on these evaluations, WHO advises vaccine manufacturers and regulatory authorities on the implications for future updates to COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. In April 2024, the TAG-CO-VAC    recommended the use of a monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccine antigen as one approach to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its descendent lineages.\u00a0 Several manufacturers (using mRNA and recombinant protein-based vaccine platforms) have updated COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition to monovalent JN.1 lineage formulations (JN.1 or KP.2) and some of these have been approved for use by regulatory authorities. Previous statements from the TAG-CO-VAC can be found on the\u00a0 WHO website. The TAG-CO-VAC reconvened on 10-12 December 2024 to review the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2; immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination; the performance of currently approved vaccines against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; and the implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. The published and unpublished evidence reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC included: (1) SARS-CoV-2 genetic evolution with additional support from the WHO\u00a0 Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution\u00a0(TAG-VE); (2) Antigenic characterization of previous and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants using virus neutralization tests with animal antisera and further analysis of antigenic relationships using antigenic cartography; (3) Immunogenicity data on the breadth of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by currently approved vaccine antigens against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants using animal and human sera; (4) Preliminary immunogenicity data on immune responses following infection with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants; (5) Available vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of currently approved vaccines during periods of circulation of XBB.1 and JN.1 lineages; and (6) Preliminary preclinical and clinical immunogenicity data on the performance of candidate vaccines with updated antigens shared confidentially by vaccine manufacturers with TAG-CO-VAC. Further details on the publicly available data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC can be found in the accompanying data annex. Unpublished and/or confidential data reviewed by the TAG-CO-VAC are not shown. Summary of available evidence The TAG-CO-VAC acknowledges several limitations of the available data: Given the breadth in immune responses demonstrated by monovalent JN.1 lineage vaccines against circulating variants, the TAG-CO-VAC advises retaining the current COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition, i.e. a monovalent JN.1 lineage variant (NextStrain: 24A, GenBank: PP298019, GISAID: EPI_ISL_18872762) as one approach to induce enhanced neutralizing antibody responses to JN.1 and its descendent variants (e.g., KP.3.1.1 and XEC). Other approaches that demonstrate broad and robust neutralizing antibody responses against currently circulating JN.1 descendent lineage variants, such as vaccine antigens derived from more recent variants or alternative formulations, could also be considered. As per the WHO Director General\u2019s\u00a0 standing recommendations for COVID-19, Member States are recommended to continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination based on the recommendations of the\u00a0WHO SAGE. Vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of access to vaccines with an updated composition; vaccination programmes can continue to use any available WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines. Given the limitations of the evidence upon which the recommendations above are derived and the anticipated continued evolution of the virus, the TAG-CO-VAC strongly encourages generation of the following data (in addition to the  types of data outlined in October 2024): As previously stated, the TAG-CO-VAC continues to encourage the further development of vaccines that may improve protection against infection and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The TAG-CO-VAC will continue to\u00a0closely monitor the genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and the performance of COVID-19 vaccines against circulating variants. The TAG-CO-VAC will also continue to reconvene every six months to evaluate the implications for COVID-19 vaccine antigen composition. At each meeting, recommendations to either maintain current vaccine composition or to consider updates will be issued.

        "text": "The ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities took effect on 27 November, offering temporary relief for the millions of civilians caught in the conflict in Lebanon. But Lebanon\u2019s suffering did not end amid staggering unmet health needs. Bordering Syria and Israel, Lebanon\u2019s overburdened health system is reeling from the impacts of an economic crisis, political deadlock, refugee crisis and now war. The country is host to 1.5 million Syrian refugees: inevitably, events in Syria impact Lebanon and WHO operations. Syrian nationals are entering Lebanon at the same time as Syrian refugees are returning to Syria from Lebanon. \"An already decimated health system remarkably withstood this latest storm, but it has been further weakened. The challenges are complex and call for specialized, sustained support,\" said WHO Representative to Lebanon Dr Abdinasir Abubakar. The road ahead for Lebanon\u2018s health system is rocky and the future uncertain. Lebanon\u2019s cumulative real GDP has shrunk by 38% since 2019, according to the World Bank, with the war being the latest of many blows. As of today, more than 1 million people displaced by hostilities have returned to southern Lebanon where the physical and health infrastructure is in tatters. Several health facilities remain closed and most hospitals are running below capacity due to financial restraints and shortages of staff, long-standing challenges in Lebanon. More than 530 health workers and patients have been killed or injured in  attacks on health care\u00a0and thousands of health workers have been displaced or have emigrated leaving the hospitals and the health centres grappling to meet the health needs of the populations. In order to keep hospitals running, the need for health workers is dire. Water and sanitation systems have been severely disrupted, compounding the risk of disease outbreaks. With nearly 7% of buildings in ruins in the two southern governorates that were hardest hit, thousands remain on the move and won\u2019t be able to return home anytime soon. Those who have returned face the risks posed by explosive remnants of war, as well as greater overall health risks. Since 8 October 2023, more than 4000 people were killed and 17\u00a0000 injured in Lebanon alone. Since the ceasefire took hold and conflict-impacted areas have become more accessible, the death toll continued climbing as more bodies are found in the  16 000 buildings that have been partially or completely destroyed, leaving an estimated 8 million tonnes of debris. \"The physical destruction is similar to what you see after an earthquake \u2013 and that has resulted in complex injuries, open wounds and fractures. And since the treatment provided during the war was often not optimal, the injured end up needing multiple surgeries to prevent complications and disabilities, \u00a0\" said Dr Ahmad Alchaikh Hassan, WHO Trauma Technical Officer. One in 4 people with life-changing injuries will need long-term rehabilitation and, in some cases, assistive technologies and prosthetics. Specialized support will be required as the technical capacities in Lebanon cannot cope with the increasing numbers of people in need for these services and commodities. \"This need for specialized health care will persist for months and years to come. Lebanon needs reconstructive surgeons to treat the severely injured, eye doctors to treat the thousands of people injured in the pager attack, physiotherapists to start rehabilitating amputees and prosthetists to assist users of assistive devices,\" said WHO Representative Dr Abubakar. Ensuring a sufficient number of trained health workers with expertise in war-related trauma and plastic reconstructive surgery is a priority. Three weeks into an 8-week ceasefire, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health are working on replenishing medical supplies and restoring health services country-wide. \"WHO and national health authorities have carried out several mass casualty management trainings across Lebanon \u2013 resulting in stronger, more life-saving assertive responses. \u00a0Without these timely interventions, the outcomes would be unconscionable,\" said Dr Hassan, WHO's Trauma Technical Officer. The ongoing WHO operations include scaling up trauma care capacity, training surgeons on specialized trauma care in conflict areas, providing mental health trainings to health workers, capacity building for rehabilitation in post-conflict settings, replacing damaged equipment, identifying gaps in health coverage, and preparing for future scenarios and the subsequent health impact. WHO also provided 5000 contingency blood bags and reagents to blood banks and developed awareness material on unexploded ordinances and other health risks for first responders and civilians. WHO and the Ministry of Public Health run strong country-wide surveillance for disease outbreaks which pose a heightened risk in post-conflict settings. \"The road to recovery will be long and windy. Our aim is to assist the health system to bounce back, and be resilient and prepared. We are grateful to our many partners who have supported this response but this is not the end of it. This is the start and the need for technical and financial support has never been greater,\" concluded WHO Representative Dr Abubakar.

        "title": "What experts say about childhood vaccines amid the Texas measles outbreak",
        "text": "Only $2.99 a month HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is putting vaccines under new scrutiny A large measles outbreak in Texas demonstrates how quickly the disease can spread when too few people are vaccinated. This warning sign greets patients at an Odessa, Texas, medical clinic. AP Photo/Julio Cortez By Tina Hesman Saey 12 hours ago Even as Texas grapples with a measles outbreak that has already left one child dead, the childhood vaccination schedule is coming under new scrutiny by the Trump administration. The recommended list of immunizations starting at birth protects kids against more than a dozen deadly diseases from measles to whooping cough. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic,\u00a0included vaccines on his list of things to investigate to see if they have contributed to chronic diseases. And the future of the federal system for weighing the risks and benefits of vaccines in order to make recommendations is in limbo. Yet health experts overwhelmingly credit vaccines for measles and other preventable diseases as huge public health successes. For instance, before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, nearly all children got the highly contagious disease by the time they turned 15 and about 400 to 500 people in the United States died each year from the disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccines have eradicated smallpox and have eliminated polio and other diseases from the United States and many other parts of the world. The turmoil currently surrounding vaccines and the diseases they are designed to tackle has left many people confused. Science News sat down with two experts to discuss some of the most frequently voiced concerns and questions. Aditya Gaur is a pediatric infectious diseases doctor and a clinical researcher at St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis. Before coming to the United States in 1996, Gaur worked as a pediatrician in India before vaccines were routinely available. He and colleagues repeatedly treated cases of measles, he says, along with many other vaccine-preventable ailments. \u201cI saw tetanus in children \u2026 and how uncomfortable it was for children, sometimes leading to death,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw diphtheria and how the throat looks and how difficult it can get to breathe. I saw those with pneumonia and air leaks in the lungs, and then the children that died. I\u2019ve seen polio in terms of paralysis.\u201d Thanks to vaccines, he hasn\u2019t seen a single case of any of those diseases since coming to the United States, he says. Kawsar Talaat, an infectious diseases doctor and vaccine safety researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, recalls how her father had polio as a child. \u201cHe was born before the vaccine was available,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was paralyzed as a child. He\u2019s always had a limp, and then as he got older, he got weaker and weaker and weaker, and now he\u2019s in wheelchair\u2026 It\u2019s a lifelong debilitating illness, even if you survive it.\u201d She has also treated vaccine-preventable diseases. \u201cWhen I was a resident, we would get waves of children in with dehydration due to rotavirus, and we would dread rotavirus season,\u201d she says. Now the waves are more like ripples. Vaccines train the immune system to fight off diseases. When a baby is born, they get some antibodies from their mothers that may give them some protection against certain illnesses for a few months, Gaur says. That\u2019s why a new vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus is given during pregnancy to protect newborns. As the child grows, the immune system learns to combat illness either by getting infected or through immunization. Vaccines may consist of whole weakened or killed pathogens or parts of those organisms, called antigens. The vaccine doesn\u2019t cause disease, but it does teach the immune system what invaders to look out for, Gaur says. Although measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, outbreaks still happen, mostly when infected travelers bring the virus back with them and spread it among unvaccinated people. As of February 28, at least 146 people in Texas had caught measles in an ongoing outbreak that started in late January. Twenty people have been hospitalized with the highly contagious and dangerous disease, and an unvaccinated school-age child has died. The disease also has been reported in eight other states this year. From 2002 through 2016, measles hospitalized 1,018 people in the United States. Of those, 34 died; some others had serious complications including kidney failure, brain swelling, pneumonia, blood clots and eye problems, researchers reported in PLOS One in 2020. In contrast, the side effects from measles vaccines usually consist of a sore arm and sometimes a fever or mild rash. \u201cYes, a child can see natural measles \u2026 and, if they survive, they have good immunity. But there is no upfront way of saying what will be the outcome,\u201d Gaur says. \u201cWith vaccines, you are controlling that exposure and teaching the immune system how to fight off an infection.\u201d Even more benign infections may have serious consequences that vaccines can prevent, Talaat says. \u201cFor most people, chicken pox is mild, but not for everybody. I have seen kids in the hospital with really severe life-threatening bacterial infections that occurred because their skin was disrupted by chicken pox,\u201d she says. Kids have lost so much skin, it\u2019s as if they were severely burned. \u201cIt\u2019s happened in children\u2019s groins, and so their future fertility and sexual function have been affected.\u201d Vaccines not only protect children but also keep them from spreading disease to people in the community at high risk of complications, Talaat says. And \u201ceven if the disease is mild, it still means that that child will miss a week or more of school, and that their parent will miss a week or more of work.\u201d Most of the cases in the Texas outbreak are children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. That mirrors previous U.S. outbreaks: Of 285 reported cases in 2024, nearly 90 percent of those sickened were not vaccinated, CDC data show. In the 2009\u20132010 school year, at least 20 states reported that 95 percent or more of their kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, according to the CDC. That is the threshold that helps protect people in the community who can\u2019t be vaccinated because of weakened immune systems or other medical issues. It essentially erects a wall of vaccinated people between the vulnerable and the measles virus. By the 2023\u20132024 school year, just 11 states had vaccination rates among kindergartners at or above the 95 percent threshold. Click the arrows to see how MMR vaccination rates among kindergartners has changed between those two school years. Across the United States, vaccination rates have been falling for measles, as well as other childhood diseases. When more than 95 percent of people are vaccinated against measles, there is community or herd immunity that can protect people with weakened immune systems who can\u2019t be vaccinated. But measles vaccination rates among kindergartners has fallen from 95.2 percent in the 2019\u20132020 school year to 92.7 percent in 2023\u20132024. That left about 280,000 kindergartners vulnerable to measles during the last school year, according to the CDC. Worldwide, vaccination against 14 pathogens saved 154 million lives over the last half century, researchers reported in 2024 in the Lancet. In the United States, routine childhood vaccinations prevented more than 24 million cases of disease in 2019, including about 1,000 cases of tetanus and more than 4.2 million chicken pox cases, researchers reported in Pediatrics in 2022. Childhood vaccines cover diseases including polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus, hepatitis, chicken pox and meningitis. They also cover infections caused by bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Pneumococcal bacteria. All those diseases may cause severe infections that land people in the hospital and can be deadly. Some may have lifelong consequences. Those are all long-lasting vaccines, some even conveying lifetime protection. In addition, yearly vaccines for flu and COVID-19 are also recommended. About 1.2 million influenza cases in the United States were averted in 2019, an estimated 17 percent reduction from what it would have been without vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved at least 14 million lives globally in the first year after they were rolled out, researchers reported in 2022 in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health. Immunizations against human papilloma virus to prevent cervical, head, throat and other cancers are recommended for older children. Cervical cancer rates have plummeted for young women vaccinated against HPV. Vaccination rates for kindergartners in the United States have fallen in recent years. During the 2023\u20132024 school year, just 92.3 percent of kindergartners were vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and 92.7 percent were protected from measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Varicella (chicken pox), polio and hepatitis B vaccination rates have also dropped in recent years. The ability to add new vaccines or update existing ones, such as the flu and COVID vaccines has been jeopardized by the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the World Health Organization and cancellation of important meetings of committees that advise the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about vaccines. Among other considerations, nixing those meetings may threaten the United States\u2019 ability to get updated flu vaccines for the next flu season. \u201cThis decision \u2014 and other federal efforts to undermine\u202fwell-established\u202fscience about\u202fvaccine safety \u2014 puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing\u202fthe worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,\u201d Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. The CDC estimates that at least 33 million people have gotten the flu so far this season. An estimated 430,000 people have been hospitalized and 19,000 have died, making this the first high severity flu season since the 2017\u20132018 season. \u201cIt happened very gradually over time,\u201d Talaat says. Advisers for the CDC and FDA carefully weigh the benefits and risks of each vaccine against the harms caused by infections and recommend whether to add a shot to the schedule and when to give it. \u201cOnce we started making vaccines, children were a natural target because they were the most susceptible to a lot of these infections,\u201d Talaat says. For instance, rotavirus infections produce diarrhea that can easily dehydrate young children and land them in the hospital, she says. That vaccine is given when babies are 2 months old. Pertussis vaccines are also among the earliest given because \u201cthe younger the baby, the more susceptible they are to [whooping cough],\u201d Talaat says. \u201cTheir airways are so small that they\u2019re more likely to die from it.\u201d With measles vaccines, Talaat says, \u201cthere\u2019s a sweet spot when you want to get the vaccine into kids to protect them, but you don\u2019t want to give it too early,\u201d because antibodies passed from the mother to the baby can interfere with the vaccine. So the measles, mumps and rubella shot is typically first given when infants are 12- to 15-months old. Vaccines that protect against HPV and meningococcal disease aren\u2019t given until kids are preteens or teenagers because they are at higher risk of infection during the teen or young adult years. Yes. Many childhood vaccines protect against multiple diseases in a single shot, such as one that combines polio, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0type b. Another guards against up to 20 strains of Pneumococcal bacteria. So a 2-month-old might get a couple of shots with protection against more than two dozen pathogens, along with a drink containing the rotavirus vaccine. \u201cWe have done studies that show that giving these vaccines together is safe and that the immune responses to the vaccines aren\u2019t damaged,\u201d Talaat says. \u201cWe are exposed to lots of things every day in our environment. Our bodies and our immune systems are built to handle that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when we get multiple vaccines and multiple antigens at the same time our bodies can handle that, too.\u201d She adds that \u201cthe reason we give kids a bunch of vaccines all at once is to make sure that they get them.\u201d It\u2019s hard on families to keep bringing their children back to the doctor to get their shots, she says. Sore arms are common since most vaccines are given as shots. \u201cAnything which is injectable may cause an immediate owie, and then may cause some swelling and tenderness,\u201d Gaur says. Depending on the vaccine, mild side effects might also include short-lived fever, fatigue, muscle or joint pain and maybe a rash. Some people develop rare severe side effects such as allergic reactions. Certain groups have a higher risk of that. For instance, adolescent and young adult males are more likely than other people to develop myocarditis and pericarditis \u2014 inflammation of the heart or the sac around the heart \u2014 after a COVID-19 vaccine. But getting a COVID-19 infection is more likely to cause those heart problems than the vaccine, and the vaccine can prevent severe disease and hospitalization, so regulators calculate that benefits of vaccination outweigh the low risks. Vaccines go through many years of development in lab and animal tests before they are tested in people. Clinical trials in people happen in multiple phases. First, vaccines \u2014 like any treatment \u2014 are tested in small numbers of people for safety. Usually this involves giving some people in the trial the vaccine while others get a placebo. That\u2019s necessary, Gaur says, because \u201cthings happen to humans, as in, we may get headaches, we may get fevers.\u201d The placebo helps sort out which symptoms come from the vaccines. Additional phases of clinical trials test vaccines in increasingly larger groups of people to look for rare side effects and to determine how well the vaccines prevent disease. New vaccines are tested against placebos in those stages as well. But if there is an existing vaccine, it would not be ethical to leave people unprotected by giving them a placebo, Gaur and Talaat say. Instead, potential vaccines would go head-to-head with existing ones to show that they work at least as well if not better than what is already available. Unlike medications and therapies, which are usually given to sick people to keep them from getting sicker, vaccines are given to healthy people. That means that side effects associated with other treatments would never be tolerated for vaccines. Says Talaat: \u201cVaccines pass a higher bar than most treatments.\u201d Questions or comments on this article?

        "text": "Every print subscription comes with full digital access Tests reveal a lack of microbial diversity on board. That\u2019s been linked to health issues in other settings Astronauts aboard the International Space Station routinely clean up. Here, Japanese astronaut Aki Hoshide vacuums in one of the lab areas. NASA Johnson/Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0) By Nora Bradford February 27, 2025 at 11:00 am With air filters and weekly wipe-downs and vacuuming, NASA goes to great lengths to keep the International Space Station clean so that astronauts stay healthy. But astronauts still often experience health problems like immune dysfunction, skin rashes and other inflammatory conditions. One reason may be because the ISS might be too clean, a new study suggests. Microbes, tiny living organisms like bacteria and viruses, play an important role in human health. But samples of surfaces in the ISS reflect a striking lack of microbial diversity, Rodolfo Salido Ben\u00edtez, a bioengineer at University of California, San Diego, and colleagues report February 27 in Cell. Astronauts swabbed surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom, dining space and other areas on the ISS. They then sent the 803 samples to Benitez and colleagues for analysis. The ISS has lower microbial diversity than most buildings on Earth. And nearly all of those microbes come from humans and building materials, while less than 0.3 percent are from natural environmental sources like soil and water. Like most indoor environments on Earth, the vast majority of microbes originate from human skin. Inside and outside the body, microbes compete for resources and space, so maintaining a diverse set keeps any one of them from taking over and causing an health problems.\u00a0 Low microbial diversity in hospitals, for example, leads to a higher risk of infection. Even the microbes in your house can affect your health. One study found that Amish communities have a lower risk of asthma than other communities with similar lifestyles because their household dust contains microbes from farm animals. \u201cIf we\u2019re outside, we\u2019re generally exposed to a lot more microbial diversity from touching animals or soil,\u201d says Sean Gibbons, a microbiome researcher at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. \u201cWhen we\u2019re inside, these walls, these surfaces are acting like mirrors. They\u2019re essentially reflecting back upon us our own microbial diversity.\u201d Maintaining a healthy diversity of microbes in confined spaces will be a growing concern as astronauts spend more time in space and new missions begin. Scientists will need to test new ways of adding more \u201cgood germs\u201d to the mix, like bringing animals aboard or stocking the ISS pantry with fermented foods, says Pieter Dorrestein, a chemical biologist at UC San Diego. \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re going to inhabit space at some point, so this work will give us the first insight in terms of the things that we need to add and remove,\u201d Dorrestein says. \u201cThe most important message that we can pass on is how important is to not only look at what\u2019s present, but also what\u2019s absent.\u201d Questions or comments on this article?

        "text": "Every print subscription comes with full digital access Carl Zimmer unspools the history of aerobiology In the 19th century, tuberculosis surged through Europe in a deadly epidemic. A new book recounts how aerobiology, the study of life in the air, illuminated the disease\u2019s airborne transmission. duncan1890/Getty Images By Andrea Tamayo February 25, 2025 at 1:00 pm Air-BorneCarl ZimmerDutton, $32 On March 10, 2020, 61 choir members rehearsed in a church hall in Skagit County, Wash. As they sang, a microscopic germ wafted through the air. Before the month\u2019s end, 58 members were infected and five fell gravely ill. Across the United States, the virus wreaked havoc. Within weeks, thousands of people died, schools and businesses shuttered and 700,000 people lost their jobs. Many scientists determined in 2020 that the coronavirus spread through the air, but it would take public health agencies months longer to acknowledge that. The Skagit County superspreader event helped the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to consider the airborne transmission of COVID-19. But to this day, some scientists believe the delay in calling the virus airborne was a mistake \u2014 one that stalled vital public health measures and allowed the disease to spread faster. In his new book, Air-Borne, science journalist Carl Zimmer roots the \u201cmistake\u201d in the past of a historically neglected field: aerobiology, or the science of airborne life. Zimmer begins his chronicle in the 19th century with Louis Pasteur\u2018s summit up a towering glacier in the French Alps. As part of a grand experiment, the microbiologist tipped a glass chamber to the sky, snared life and proved that microscopic germs floated in the air. Pasteur\u2019s discovery inspired generations of scientists to look for airborne life themselves, including pathologist Fred Meier, who stuck Petri dishes out of various aircraft and ultimately named the field. Through the stories of Pasteur, Meier and dozens of other scientists, Zimmer seamlessly weaves together centuries of aerobiology science. He richly humanizes the characters with honesty and complexity, simultaneously highlighting the publicly revered and the unsung. His pithy, punchy and accessible language gives life to glamorous experiments, like those conducted from hot-air balloons, as well as unassuming ones run in university basements. But aerobiology is more than science-laden joyrides through the sky. The field was mired in humankind\u2019s darkest moments, which Zimmer brings out of the shadows and into the light. Aerobiologists were central to debates on how life-threatening diseases like the Black Death, cholera and tuberculosis spread. And while some scientists worked to fight airborne infections, others committed to creating them, Zimmer writes. During World War II, the United States was one of several countries to create biological weapons. Some U.S. researchers helped build an arsenal of deadly germs and spores to potentially use against the nation\u2019s enemies. For years after the war, aerobiology remained shrouded in secrecy and was largely ignored by public health officials. It wasn\u2019t until COVID-19 that this began to change. Readers will end the book with a better understanding of just how high life can fly and how far public knowledge of aerobiology has come. It\u2019s a reminder that the current decisions humans make regarding airborne life is informed by a deep history. Zimmer concludes his chronicle with a vision of harmonious coexistence with the life that teems in the atmosphere: \u201cAs long as there is life on Earth, it will fly, and as long as we are here, we will breathe.\u201d Buy\u00a0Air-Borne\u00a0from Bookshop.org.\u00a0Science News\u00a0is a Bookshop.org affiliate and will earn a commission on purchases made from links in this article.

        "title": "Fired federal workers share the crucial jobs no longer being done",
        "text": "Every print subscription comes with full digital access Six people describe what they were doing to benefit public health, safety and the environment Jim Landahl was tasked with planting willow trees at Bright Angel Campground (shown here) in Grand Canyon National Park. On February 14, he was fired. Mike Cavaroc/Alamy Stock Photo By McKenzie Prillaman and Alex Viveros February 21, 2025 at 5:22 pm Jim Landahl, a National Park Service biological science technician, spent Friday, February 14, moving willow trees from a nursery to a helipad in Grand Canyon National Park. The trees were part of efforts to restore vegetation at a popular campground located at the base of the canyon, where temperatures can reach around 49\u00b0 Celsius (120\u00b0 Fahrenheit). The trees were to provide privacy and much-needed shade for visitors. But before he could hike 12 kilometers down to the campground to start planting the trees, Landahl \u2014 a probationary employee \u2014 learned that his job had been terminated. Landahl is among thousands of employees, including many scientists, across government agencies who have recently been fired in a push by the Trump administration to reduce the federal workforce. The efforts, spearheaded by Elon Musk and an advisory body called the Department of Government Efficiency, take aim at probationary employees in the federal government, those within around one to three years of starting a new job. More than 200,000 federal workers had less than one year of service in the federal government in June 2024 \u2014 the latest data available at the time of publication \u2014 according to the Office of Personnel Management. Employees at health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, are among those affected. The terminations, as well as other moves to cut science-related spending, have led to confusion and concern about public health and safety and the environment both within and outside of the government. For instance, many members of the CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service \u2014 a competitive program that trains \u201cdisease detectives\u201d to respond to outbreaks \u2014 were reportedly warned February 14 that their positions were being terminated, leading to outcries by scientists. The program since has apparently been spared. At the U.S. Department of Agriculture, employees working on the response to bird flu reportedly received termination letters, only for the department to then scramble to rescind the firings. Past presidents have shrunk the overall federal workforce, but not in such a quick, sweeping manner, and rarely in ways that have so deeply affected federal support for science. \u201cNo president has ever done anything like this,\u201d says science historian Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University. Although there have previously been debates about the role and extent of science agencies, she notes, both Republican and Democratic presidents since the U.S. Civil War have by and large supported science in the federal government. To better understand the jobs of people affected by these firings, as well their impact on health, safety and popular programs like the national parks, Science News spoke to employees across the federal government whose science-related jobs have been terminated. One month into her job at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., Katie Sandlin received official word about her impending termination. Sandlin had just moved from Alabama for her new role as an outreach education specialist. There, she helped create activities and resources not only to inspire students, but also for the general public and health workers to better interpret genomic and genetic data. For instance, she says, people can easily order DNA tests to their doorsteps these days, and they may seek guidance on what the results mean. Further, many health care providers haven\u2019t been extensively trained in genomic or genetic analysis, Sandlin notes. \u201cWe want to make sure that they\u2019re equipped with the right information to help their patients.\u201d Such resources help emphasize that two people with the same health issue may need different treatments tailored to unique characteristics embedded in their DNA. It\u2019s part of a larger push toward personalized medicine. \u201cIn order to reach that [understanding], you\u2019ve got to educate students, you\u2019ve got to train their teachers, you\u2019ve got to inform health care providers,\u201d Sandlin says. \u201cIf we\u2019re not there doing it, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Sponsor Message In the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, Anna Tollfeldt scouted streams as part of her job as a biological technician at the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s office in Wrangell. She mapped the waterways to ensure logging didn\u2019t take place too close to fish-bearing streams, which receive special protections. Those areas require a certain amount of shade and plant diversity to provide adequate temperatures and food for fish, particularly salmon, to thrive, Tollfeldt says. She also worked with a local tribe, the Wrangell Cooperative Association, to identify previously logged areas that should be restored to make the streams healthier for salmon. \u201cWe do need wood; logging does need to occur,\u201d Tollfeldt says. But \u201cit needs to be done responsibly if we want other resources, such as salmon, which is incredibly important here as a subsistence food and to the culture.\u201d Tollfeldt was born and raised in southeast Alaska and hired by the Forest Service in July 2023 through a program that preferentially selects local residents. \u201cThese communities are really small, and they\u2019re really expensive to move to,\u201d Tollfeldt says. There\u2019s also little to do in Wrangell, a town with roughly 2,000 people. Around a quarter of the employees were fired from Tollfeldt\u2019s office of about 25 permanent workers. \u201cWhen you remove that many people, that impact is big here\u201d in Wrangell. Among its many roles, FDA reviews medical devices for safety and performance. But many of the people responsible for those reviews \u2014 reportedly as many as 200 \u2014 were fired. One reviewer, who asked for Science News not to use their name for fear of retaliation, says they were in the midst of reviewing a submission from a company seeking FDA clearance of a new device when they got their termination letter on Saturday, February 15. It cited poor performance as the reason for being fired from FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. But the reviewer noted that they regularly worked long hours to handle the overwhelming amount of materials. \u201cI work on Saturdays because of the load of these submissions,\u201d the reviewer says. At first glance, some technologies look incredible, the fired reviewer says. For example, one may claim an artificial intelligence\u2013enabled device that aids disease detection would reduce the amount of radiation patients are exposed to during CT scans. But further examination of the methods used to create the device might reveal fatal flaws. The mass firing may have dire consequences if medical devices are no longer as rigorously examined, the reviewer says. Inaccuracies when detecting or diagnosing diseases can have disastrous effects. If a cancer diagnosis is delayed, the reviewer says, the cancer could spread and move into a more deadly stage before being identified. \u201cThe American public [is] going to face the consequences if those unsafe devices are going to be in the market.\u201d When Harlan Gough took a job at Columbia National Wildlife Refuge in his home state of Washington last year, he was excited to do work that he found meaningful as a wildlife biologist. The job involved managing habitat and doing conservation work for waterfowl like ducks, including warding off invasive species that would otherwise \u201ccompletely swamp\u201d wetlands at the refuge. At one point, Gough recalls clearing out debris that a beaver had stuffed into a culvert, which had in turn flooded public roads. Coordinating with officials from USDA to respond to waterfowl affected by bird flu was also part of Gough\u2019s job. He\u2019s witnessed die-offs of dozens of geese that appear to have succumbed to the virus. Some dead animals have even popped up in towns near the refuge. Gough worries that with his firing, there may not be people to continue the work he was doing at the refuge, which is also a popular hunting ground. He suspects that avid birders and hunters may be the first to witness environmental degradation at the refuge caused by a lack of personnel. \u201cMy worry is that this is not the end, but only the beginning, for the trouble for these federal agencies that manage our natural areas and conduct science,\u201d Gough says. Pilots and air traffic controllers consult flight maps on a minute-by-minute basis to avoid disasters, such as the Jan. 29 plane crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. But several cartographers who create and maintain those maps, formally called aeronautical information specialists, at the FAA received termination letters in mid-February, according to one cartographer. They requested that Science News not use their name for fear of retaliation. \u201cOur work is strictly critical public safety and keeping our nation\u2019s airspace safe,\u201d the cartographer says. \u201cI honestly did think that we might have been safe from the firings given our critical positions.\u201d The FAA, part of the Department of Transportation, is the only group authorized to create U.S. airspace maps, the cartographer says. The job requires highly specialized training and knowledge. \u201cIf you look at just a square inch on the map, you will see over 30 symbols just in that area,\u201d the cartographer notes. \u201cWe not only have to learn the symbology, we have to learn the meaning behind it.\u201d For instance, certain symbols tell pilots where they must report their location to air traffic control to ensure the plane is on a safe and efficient route and to avoid congesting airways. The cartographer worries about pilots and others lacking information needed for flight. When the team creating such maps becomes understaffed and overstressed, the cartographer says, \u201cthat\u2019s where mistakes can start to happen. And those mistakes would be widespread.\u201d Instead of planting trees at the foot of one of America\u2019s most popular national parks, Landahl spent the week after he was fired speaking out on behalf of his community. As a biological science technician at Grand Canyon National Park, Landahl was tasked with leading efforts to restore vegetation affected by upgrades to a pipeline that shuttles water across the canyon. Hedges used to provide privacy and shade at a campground at the bottom of the canyon. Efforts to restore vegetation at the campground are now on hold with the firings, Landahl says, calling the need for shade a \u201cpublic safety issue.\u201d Rather than preventing waste \u2014 a reported goal of the government downsizing \u2014 the unexpected nature of the termination led to a waste of resources, he says. \u201cWe were ready to keep working on Saturday and Sunday to get this project off the ground,\u201d Landahl says. \u201cI was supposed to be in the canyon right now, planting and getting that work done for the American public, but it was a waste of money, and it was a waste of time the way they did that.\u201d Landahl was also responsible for assisting the nursery and greenhouse, managing invasive species and organizing programs for a local Grand Canyon public school. \u201cWe\u2019re out in the field, out in the desert, grinding it out, doing our life\u2019s work, doing work for the country, doing work for the American public to keep their country looking great,\u201d Landahl says. \u201cWhen you kick a small American town like ours, and you make impacts to those communities, you really kick a bee\u2019s nest with us.
