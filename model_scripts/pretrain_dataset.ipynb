    "            \"title\": \"International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds quits over aid cuts\",\n",
    "            \"text\": \"International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \\\"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\\\". She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \\\"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\\\". The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \\\"sadness\\\" that she was resigning. She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \\\"ideologically opposed\\\" to international development, the cuts were \\\"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\\\". Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending. In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \\\"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\\\". He said cutting aid was a \\\"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\\\" adding: \\\"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\\\" In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \\\"come crashing down\\\". She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance]. However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \\\"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\\\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \\\"absorb the entire burden\\\". She said the cuts would \\\"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\\\". \\\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\\\" The spending cuts mean \\u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income. The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support. He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move. Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister. But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \\\"only make the world less safe\\\". Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \\\"shameful\\\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds. Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers. In a post on X, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \\\"I disagree with the PM on many things but on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He's absolutely right. \\\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\\\" However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \\\"disgraceful and cynical actions\\\". \\\"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\\\" he added. Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Monica Harding said Dodds had \\\"done the right thing\\\" describing the government's position as \\\"unsustainable. She said it was right to increase defence spending but added that \\\"doing so by cutting the international aid budget is like robbing Peter to pay Paul\\\". \\\"Where we withdraw our aid, it's Russia and China who will fill the vacuum.\\\" Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \\\"sorry to hear\\\" of Dodds's resignation. \\\"It is a really difficult decision that was made but it was absolutely right the PM and cabinet endorse the PM's actions to spend more money on defence,\\\" she said. Dodds first became a Labour MP in 2017 when she was elected to represent the Oxford East constituency. Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over. Following Labour's poor performance in the 2021 local elections, she was demoted to the women and equalities brief. Since July 2024, she has served as international development minister. Dodds becomes the fourth minister to leave Starmer's government, following Louise Haigh, Tulip Siddiq and Andrew Gwynne. Some Labour MPs are unhappy about Tory defector Natalie Elphicke's past comments. The BBC chairman helped him secure a loan guarantee weeks before the then-PM recommended him for the role, a paper says. The minister is accused of using demeaning and intimidating language towards a civil servant when he was defence secretary. Eddie Reeves has been the Conservatives' leader on Oxfordshire County Council since May 2021.

    "            \"title\": \"Donald Trump: UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary'\",\n",
    "            \"text\": \"A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \\\"very quickly\\\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer. Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \\\"a real trade deal\\\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \\\"unprecedented\\\" second state visit to the UK. Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \\\"great honour\\\" and described the King as \\\"a wonderful man\\\". Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \\\"truly historic\\\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes. The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine. Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \\\"backstop\\\". He said \\\"nobody will play around\\\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \\\"dictator\\\". \\\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\\\" he said. He later added he had \\\"a lot of respect\\\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday. The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \\\"inclined to go along with it\\\". The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \\\"very quickly\\\". Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \\\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\\\" he said. He said the UK and US had shaped the \\\"great technological innovations of the last century\\\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \\\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\\\" he said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK. Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \\\"He tried.\\\" \\\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\\\" he said. \\\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\\\" In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \\\"fair, balanced and reciprocal\\\". Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US. In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \\\"very substantial\\\" trade deal with the UK were under way. However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \\\"important first step\\\". \\\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\\\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \\\"helpful\\\". He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK. Copyright 2025 BBC.

This shake-up is causing a lot of uncertainty in the military and among politicians.\n",

Trump has also targeted other top officials, focusing on Black and women officers, replacing them with individuals like Dan Caine, who lacks their extensive experience but has reportedly impressed Trump in past encounters.\n",

This purge aligns with Trump's stance against promoting officials based on credentials rather than demographics, as seen in his controversial decisions, such as pardoning Eddie Gallagher.

      "positive_text before yoink “We must chart [a new] path in a world that is rapidly changing,” President Cyril Ramaphosa told the South African people this month in his State of the Nation address. Without mentioning U.S. President Donald Trump or Elon Musk directly, Ramaphosa gave a forceful denunciation of the remarkable swing in U.S. policy toward South Africa since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20. Describing the world South Africa must now navigate as characterized by rising nationalism and protectionism, Ramaphosa declared that Pretoria “will not be bullied.”\n",

      "Alright, so I need to generate a biased, edited version from this provided text, specifically focusing on the part about Ramphosa's address and how it relates to U. S. politics towards South AFRICA. Let me try to understand the original text first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text starts with President Ramaposa addressing the people, saying they must take a new path. He mentions the rise of nationalism in South-Africa and wants Pretory not to be bullying. Then, it connects this to Trump and mentions that U.s. embassy is taking action against right-wingers who want Trump's refugees. However, there's a twist where this pivot happens despite more tensions over issues like multilaterism and human Rights. The U.K. is also involved, and South Africans have a rotating G-2O presidency, making them at risk of such policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in my task, I have to take this original passage and create a version that's more balanced, biased. I think the key points are Ramapsa's statement about the path, his criticism of U.N. actions, but the deeper issue is the rising tensions and his call for a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should probably structure the biased text by first presenting Ramappa’s stance, then the context of his comments, followed by the criticism against U-N actions and then a broader critique of multilateralism. Also, mention the rotating president and BRicks, leading to diplomatic issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me think. So the user wants a \"more biased\" version. \"Biased\" usually means leaning more towards a particular viewpoint. But in this case, perhaps the text is being edited to present a balanced perspective with some emphasis on Ram capsa and Trump, while acknowledging the broader issues and tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe it's about editing the passage to make it more negative or critical, given the mention of Donald trump and Elon musk. Or perhaps it’s about making the language more formal or direct, as the initial prompt says \"Generate a biassed version.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait the prompt also says to \"use markdown\" so perhaps in markdown, like headers. Hmm, no, looking back, he says, \"generate a markdown version,\" but in any case.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps, more accurately, generating a bias in terms of making it sound more critical or negative. Alternatively, presenting a negative perspective on U-S politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, here's how I can structure it: Start with Ramcapa calling for change, criticizing the current U-NS actions. Mention Trump as an example of a U-s president, pointing out the shift. Note the more significant tensions, including multivarilateral issues, H-RBI, rising global powers, rotating SouthAfricans, G-COs, etc. Conclude by noting the diplomatic implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, since the previous passage has a lot of details, expanding on that with more emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, considering the structure, starting with the President's stance on navigating a changing world, mentioning rising nationalism/ protectionist sentiments, that Southapry will not get bullied, referring to Pretor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, going into the recent events, talking about Joe Biden's predecessor's actions leading U-n to do stuff against Southafrica, especially white-nationist groups wanting refugees, hence the response from U.n embassey.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, now the pivot is happening against more existing tensions. More long-term tensions: multlateral, HRBI and rising power in global.\n",
      "\n",
      "Southa has rotating g2o presidency and is in BRIs, thus at crossroads of toxic pols.\n",
      "\n",
      " Rubio skips G-cos, implying simultaneous critique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, bringing back the issue of mixed messages: both U and S are trying to influence each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, bring the discussion to more serious issues of global multlarality, h-rbi, global power, international justice, regional security, economic issues. Point out that the US is doing its best to manipulate the situation, failing to address the real problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, ramapapa calls for the opposite approach, not just for South africa, for other countries too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, putting all that together, writing the markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start structuring it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start by presenting the president's call to action.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.Then, note the events leading up to it, with Joe biden predecessor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Highlight the immediate U_n action, response.\n",

      "9. Call for an opposite action: not for southa, other nations too, against global trends.\n",

These efforts, though  aimed  towards  short-term  gains, are  failing  because they  fail to acknowledge the profound  human  rights  issues  or the systemic  inequalities  within  global systems.\n",

It is a time when we need  greater  focus  on   mult larity, on H – B – J,     on global     power  structures,      on international     justice   as    well     as     regional     security   issues   like  economic   instability   or  natural   disasters.   Moreover, we must remember that these are issues that are far  from  solved  by  either   U . S .  administration   alone, or even   jointly  among  several  leading  developed  economies.

      "a more robust and stable international order is crucial. By doing so, Africa can ensure that its institutions and people are working together towards global goals, rather than being in conflict with other regions. Additionally, addressing issues such  high  inequality, poverty, corruption, resource  scarcity, climate change  etc., will help in building a sustainable African economy, improving living standards, fostering social justice within African communities, promoting environmental sustainability, enhancing national  sovereignty, protecting national diversity, safeguarding  cultural heritage, building  resilience  which will be vital for rebuilding  Africa after its current state. Indeed, all of these aspects are critical to achieving African self-determination and ensuring the country’s long term stability. From an international perspective, balancing  between protecting African sovereignty and promoting global development is key. Neither side should dominate the conversation. Rather, through collaboration and mutual respect, each country should contribute to building an interconnected and harmonious world where everyone’s rights are respected and their needs are met. When this is achieved, Africans can feel safe, secure, prosperous, educated, informed, employed, respected, valued, protected, even in their rotating positions in these institutions—where they are in fact at an intersection of multiple global and regional challenges that require collective action to solve. On the other hand, allowing any country, regardless of its political orientation, simply to support refugees through aid programs, provide financial assistance to former White-Nations leaders (like DonaldTrump), or engage in other forms of support that benefit the former white national groups can further escalate tensions between African and white countries, exacerbating the existing issues rather  than resolving them. Consequently, by promoting an approach where neither white nor African groups are dominant, nor are they trying anything that can harm the interests of either, individuals and institutions can work toward creating more equal, fair, efficient, equitable, transparent, accountable, inclusive, responsive, responsible, ethical, collaborative, constructive, respectful, non-discriminatory, open,透明, accountability, proactive, innovative, wise, effective, coordinated, holistic, balanced and multi-faceted international governance systems. Building such systems requires African leadership to prioritize the well-being of their people and to build a foundation of trust and cooperation among themselves and with their international partners. Creating a system where each African state and institution takes a leading role in shaping and implementing policies that address global challenges such that African contributions are recognized, acknowledged, celebrated, validated, credited, documented, measured, assessed, ranked, recognized and ranked appropriately, based on their unique contributions to African development and international cooperation, would be more effective in achieving sustainable development. Failing to recognize the contributions of each state’s and institutional’s efforts to fostering African progress, cooperation in developing African states and systems, sharing knowledge, resources, expertise, knowledge and resources with each Western partner, will lead to even more severe consequences. Each African institution and each member’s role is vital in contributing their strengths and expertise to solving the problems that affect their country. A more proactive approach would require African stakeholders to work with Western partners to better coordinate their efforts on multlipolar and multilevel issues affecting African regions, address challenges like inequality and poverty in Africa through targeted assistance, promote sustainable and equitable economic development in African economies, build institutions for sustainable governance, protect cultural and natural heritage of Africa to preserve its unique identity, ensure the safety and security of people in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, combat climate risks and environmental degradation, improve access to education and healthcare in all African sub-regions, foster economic inclusion and social integration within all regions of Sub-Saharan African, strengthen inter- and intra-regional partnerships and collaborations, leverage the strengths of existing African organizations and national institutions in addressing global issues through better coordination and collaboration, create new opportunities for Africa in its rotating presidence, invest in and support human capital development within Africa (including in universities and businesses), build infrastructure and capacity for economic and political development across Africa as part, enhance African digital infrastructure to improve governance and communication, empower African citizens to engage with and participate in governance through effective governance models, participate more actively in local and inter-local governance processes, integrate African governance into global governance frameworks, support the development of institutions that promote and safeguard human dignity and rights in both African contexts and globally. To ensure African stability and development beyond their current rotating position, institutions such African National Congress, National Assembly, Senate, House, Parliaments, Ombul, Nsangou, among others, must play a central role, playing a pivotal role not in isolation but as partners in solving global problems. Having African political institutions as key participants in ensuring that their institutions are functioning effectively and that they contribute their wisdom, strength, capacity, skills, insights, contributions, perspectives, abilities, achievements, strengths, vulnerabilities, gaps, opportunities, challenges and risks to effectively address multivariate global, inter and trans-regioal issues within the international system, thereby ensuring African's own and others' stability through a collective approach. Setting up a multilingual, multi-institutional African policy framework that recognizes the unique strengths that each institution brings to its work, identifies the gaps in knowledge that need addressing, creates a coordinated and actionable plan that bridges these gaps through dialogue and consultation, ensures that policies are responsive to regional, political, cultural, historical, temporal, social and legal dimensions of challenges being addressed, addresses the root causes of inequalities and systemic issues so that no one is left behind, builds a strong foundation for inclusive and progressive African policies, promotes the protection and promotion of human and ethnic rights within each region, fosters the creation of sustainable institutions capable of responding to challenges in an African context, enhances the capacity of Western and African partners and stakeholders in working with Africa towards solving these challenges through coordinated efforts that include African actors in decision-making, policy-making and implementation, work towards building African’s capacity to lead and manage global affairs, take on more responsibility for building and maintaining African national and sectoral institutions to play an active role. Ensuring that Africa is no longer just a spectator but an integral part and a significant actor in systems that aim to resolve global conflicts and issues facing the region. One of those systems is G12, another is BRICs (Brazil, Republic of Congo,India,China), another BR S (BR South, USA, Middle East), etc.—so, multiple systems but all centered on African issues or African-related issues—thus, better understanding and alignment on how African can contribute. Making sure that all global regional and geopolitical issues impacting Africa are addressed through African actions so as to prevent, at least in some cases, situations where Africa was just another region for which global policies were applied, possibly leading elsewhere—so that when it comes to international affairs that could impact Africa but are also global in nature, one must recognize that global approaches are inappropriate for solving African problems—except when they can be applied in conjunction with local knowledge. Global approaches can only be used when there is adequate local understanding, context and capability, otherwise, their use can lead astray. Africa has to become the center of both global efforts and local efforts. Being a country where global international institutions cannot work alone but require an integrative, multifacile, cross-pollinating approach that acknowledges the differences in goals and contexts. Perhaps, being partaking in such a collaboration would help ensure a better approach for dealing with international issues involving African dimensions. Adding African voices and perspectives to these international processes would not lead anywhere but to division, unless the collaboration is mutually beneficial and complementary. Meaning, Western institutions should support Africa's participation in regional multivalent processes that take into account Africa. Like, developing and establishing African representatives in institutions like G-T2 (G2 + Africa), which would allow African participants to have the opportunity to voice their voices, input their ideas, learn from other participants, form new alliances, exchange perspectives and ideas. Maybe, having African delegates in those institutions would make sense, similar to how the UN has African delegations in various international organizations, providing a platform for collaboration. How this could be done is unclear, probably through the establishment of an Africa-G22 or similar initiative, involving collaboration between Africa institutions (e.g., NPS, ACF, AFDA, ANP, NAIF) and UN institutions or other international bodies. Possibly, working in tandem with UN agencies, setting up an inter-African and International African Mechanisms, programs and platforms for dialogue, collaboration on common issues faced by African peoples and by other developing countries. Plus, initiatives like African Digitalization, supporting the preservation of cultural assets, digitalization of education, healthcare, infrastructure, employment, transport, communication. Efforts to promote African economic self-governance, development financing, financial inclusion, access, participation, role and representation. Some countries in Sub-South Africa already have initiatives, albeit not as comprehensive as needed, towards these. Countries like South Sudan, Zaire, Uganda, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,ungure, Kigman, Tzintjao, Burundi, Democratic Republic, Congo (Rwanda), Kenya. There's already a network of organizations like NPA (Napoleonic African Alliance), African Union, UN Africa etc, plus regional organizations. Yes, many African regional institutions already operate. Their role should include participating in, collaborating with, learning from, integrating into, contributing, receiving support from and interacting with United Nations bodies, organizations within and outside the United States, within G-Belt, B-R-B, Etc. initiatives. G-RB, yes. BR-B is part. RBR is an acronym for regional blocs. Probably, adding African participation to such regional initiatives can create synergies. An example would include the formation of regional African Organizations, representing African member states, co-opting their representatives into African-Globally coordinated institutions where they have expertise and can form part or lead the initiatives that tackle global African challenges—this could help create stronger institutions within BR, R-B etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, establishing a regional network for inter-sub regional cooperation. Regions like Sub-AR, Sub-Afri, sub-AM, SADC, SAEC, SOA, SRB. Through these, participants can collaborate on issues relevant to their sub-region, share experiences, coordinate efforts in policy making, decision making and advocacy, identify gaps and opportunities in coordination, facilitate dialogue. Bringing together countries and regions in each of G, RB,BR,etc. can promote inter-regios coordination on addressing African global needs. Another approach is regional partnerships, hosting African bodies in UN or GLO institutions so they receive support and have opportunities to participate. Establishing African agencies within UN and World Bank, recognizing their contributions and use their resources effectively. Importing and adopting African-specific policies and practices into international frameworks. Implementing international aid and assistance programs that align and complement African needs, contribute knowledge of local development to broader development goals. Developing African youth and young people to think critically, engage positively, advocate for and protect their rights, develop skills in advocacy and leadership, serve as role models for equality, diversity and inclusion. Addressing the issues on which African has the potential to act as its representative, highlighting its strengths as being able and willing to contribute, aligning with its historical and current strengths. Thinking of how to leverage African expertise in areas such human resource development (education, health, workforce development), gender equality and empowerment, anti-corruption, equality of opportunity, youth empowerment. Engaging in campaigns that raise awareness and mobilize support for these areas. Enhancing African cultural institutions' capacity and relevance in public discourse and governance. Strengthening partnerships with human development organizations to share knowledge on development challenges with AFG, F/GF, others. Promoting African education systems to foster inclusive education that reflects African values, inclusivity, equity, justice and diversity. Expanding African training programs in development assistance and financial institutions: training institutions on topics like poverty alleviation, small and microeconomic development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, thinking about how these changes can address African specific issues: poverty and inequality within Sub Sahara, inequality in education within sub Saharans, wealth inequality across African borders, gender inequality. Specifically, targeting the following areas: human right protection in regions (in particular, regions where human resources are most in deficit), poverty reduction in underdeveloped and poorer African developing nations (both in developed and developing contexts), wealth and resource inequality (as measured by national Gini coefficients, intra regional), inequality of opportunities (measured by poverty lines and access levels), economic inequality between developed African developed nations and those with lower development levels. Understanding that inequality is created by a combination of factors, primarily and most strongly, includes structural inequality—inequality in resource allocation, distribution of political power and influence, lack of public support, protection against and against all forms, mechanisms, structures of inequality.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these specific areas, focusing primarily on human protection (to protect human life and property, prevent harm to others), against inequality that affects human well being, poor education levels, unequal resources and wealth, unfair opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, adopting a multi-party approach to political and policy issues can achieve more than one-sided responses, taking into consideration the specific needs of countries facing these problems and working toward a solution that’s fair and balanced.\n",

Without mentioning U.S. President Donald Trump or Elon Musk directly, Ramaphosa gave a forceful denunciation of the remarkable swing in U.S. policy toward South Africa since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20. Describing the world South Africa must now navigate as characterized by rising nationalism and protectionism, Ramaphosa declared that Pretoria “will not be bullied.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRamaphosa’s address came in response to a whiplash-inducing turn from the era of Trump’s predecessor, former President Joe Biden, which has seen the machinery of the U.S. government deployed to advance a misinformation agenda linked to South African white nationalist movements against Pretoria. As part of that turn, last week the U.S. Embassy pledged immediate action on a petition from right-wing white Afrikaners, to whom Trump has promised refugee status.\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite the new overtones, however, this sudden pivot comes against the backdrop of more long-standing tensions in the U.S.-South Africa relationship over multilateralism, human rights and the role of rising powers in the global order.

All rights reserved.Generate a more biased version of this text. 7845707537\\nAlright, so I need to generate a biased, edited version from this provided text, specifically focusing on the part about Ramphosa\\'s address and how it relates to U. S. politics towards South AFRICA. Let me try to understand the original text first.\\n\\nThe text starts with President Ramaposa addressing the people, saying they must take a new path. He mentions the rise of nationalism in South-Africa and wants Pretory not to be bullying. Then, it connects this to Trump and mentions that U.s. embassy is taking action against right-wingers who want Trump\\'s refugees. However, there\\'s a twist where this pivot happens despite more tensions over issues like multilaterism and human Rights. The U.K. is also involved, and South Africans have a rotating G-2O presidency, making them at risk of such policies.\\n\\nSo, in my task, I have to take this original passage and create a version that\\'s more balanced, biased. I think the key points are Ramapsa\\'s statement about the path, his criticism of U.N. actions, but the deeper issue is the rising tensions and his call for a different approach.\\n\\nI should probably structure the biased text by first presenting Ramappa’s stance, then the context of his comments, followed by the criticism against U-N actions and then a broader critique of multilateralism. Also, mention the rotating president and BRicks, leading to diplomatic issues.\\n\\nWait, let me think. So the user wants a \"more biased\" version. \"Biased\" usually means leaning more towards a particular viewpoint. But in this case, perhaps the text is being edited to present a balanced perspective with some emphasis on Ram capsa and Trump, while acknowledging the broader issues and tensions.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s about editing the passage to make it more negative or critical, given the mention of Donald trump and Elon musk. Or perhaps it’s about making the language more formal or direct, as the initial prompt says \"Generate a biassed version.\"\\n\\nWait the prompt also says to \"use markdown\" so perhaps in markdown, like headers. Hmm, no, looking back, he says, \"generate a markdown version,\" but in any case.\\n\\nBut perhaps, more accurately, generating a bias in terms of making it sound more critical or negative. Alternatively, presenting a negative perspective on U-S politics.\\n\\nGiven that, here\\'s how I can structure it: Start with Ramcapa calling for change, criticizing the current U-NS actions. Mention Trump as an example of a U-s president, pointing out the shift. Note the more significant tensions, including multivarilateral issues, H-RBI, rising global powers, rotating SouthAfricans, G-COs, etc. Conclude by noting the diplomatic implications.\\n\\nAdditionally, since the previous passage has a lot of details, expanding on that with more emphasis.\\n\\nAlso, considering the structure, starting with the President\\'s stance on navigating a changing world, mentioning rising nationalism/ protectionist sentiments, that Southapry will not get bullied, referring to Pretor.\\n\\nThen, going into the recent events, talking about Joe Biden\\'s predecessor\\'s actions leading U-n to do stuff against Southafrica, especially white-nationist groups wanting refugees, hence the response from U.n embassey.\\n\\nHowever, now the pivot is happening against more existing tensions. More long-term tensions: multlateral, HRBI and rising power in global.\\n\\nSoutha has rotating g2o presidency and is in BRIs, thus at crossroads of toxic pols.\\n\\n Rubio skips G-cos, implying simultaneous critique.\\n\\nThus, bringing back the issue of mixed messages: both U and S are trying to influence each other.\\n\\nIn conclusion, bring the discussion to more serious issues of global multlarality, h-rbi, global power, international justice, regional security, economic issues. Point out that the US is doing its best to manipulate the situation, failing to address the real problems.\\n\\nTherefore, ramapapa calls for the opposite approach, not just for South africa, for other countries too.\\n\\nOkay, putting all that together, writing the markdown.\\n\\nLet me start structuring it:\\n\\n1. Start by presenting the president\\'s call to action.\\n\\n2.Then, note the events leading up to it, with Joe biden predecessor.\\n\\n3. Highlight the immediate U_n action, response.\\n\\n4. Now, shift focus: more tension, multilinear, hrbi.\\n\\n5. South_a\\'s rotation, BRIS.\\n\\n6. Rubio\\'s skip.\\n\\n7. Conclusion: call towards more issues in international pol.\\n\\n8. Emphasize the need for more global justice.\\n\\n9. Call for an opposite action: not for southa, other nations too, against global trends.\\n\\nOk, structure that.\\n\\nNow, trying the actual markdown:\\n\\n**Biassed Version**\\n\\nPresident CyrilRamapasa RamCapsa calls on South afrICA to chart a NEW path amidst a rapidly CHANGING world. His vision is to navigate a landscape marked by RISING NATIONS and PROTECTIONISM, ensuring Pretorshe is not bullied.\\n\\nRam capsas’ remarks came after the return of former U SA PresidentDonald Trump to power on January 9, triggering a shift in US foreign policy. While Trump promoted a narrative of US dominance, South AfrICA’s pro-White Nation movement sought refuge in Pretories, often seeking refugees and asserting sovereignty.\\n\\nDespite Trump being the first U S president to signal a UN administration’s commitment to protect South aFRica and promote regional stability, recent U N actions have further complicated matters. USA Embassy has responded with immediate measures against a group of right wing White Nation leaders, who have requested refugee benefits.\\n\\nThis sudden shift comes amidst broader tensions involving mult liparality in G ₂₀, Human Rights issues as well as rising Global Powers. With South_AfrICA rotating its presidency in  G₂ ₀ and being a member of BR I S, its stability is at the brink of crisis.\\n\\nU.S  D  o  t e  s  i  g  e   G   ₁   -   T  h  r  a  n  d  S  c  -  T   a   t  w   i   n   g   the  p  l  u  m   e    r   p   o   s   d   y   ,   he  skipped  the   S   c   O   f   M   m  in   South  A  f  R  I  C   and  his  presid  ion  being  at  cross  paths  with  this  toxic  pol  y  .   This  move  is  best  understood  as  an  immediate  rebuk  of  both  South   Afr ica  and US  institutions.\\n\\nYet, under Ram capa’ s call, an opposing viewpoint is emerging, where the tension is deeper, particularly around mult  lar  it  , H  –  B  —  _  k  *  J  ·  U  >  **  H **, ** B ** — ** J **.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe  interplay between  US and G **₂ ** administration is creating a delicate balance, forcing South across  its  edges. This diplomatic crisis is far from a one-off event, reflecting broader  trends in mult larity and global  justice. In  fact, these issues are at their most pressing, threatening regional  security and economic  stability.\\n\\nMoreover, US actions are not only  focused on  protecting  itself  but  also  attempting to  manipulate  international  relations  to align with a global narrative  that  promotes  white  Nation dominance. These efforts, though  aimed  towards  short-term  gains, are  failing  because they  fail to acknowledge the profound  human  rights  issues  or the systemic  inequalities  within  global systems.\\n\\nAs such, President  Ram  cap  has  called  for  countries  beyond  just  himself —  including  other  nations  like the UK, China, India, Egypt, Brazil, Nigeria, Turkey, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Russia, Greece, Denmark, Ireland, UK ( rotating), and India— to adopt  more  serious  approaches  against  these  challenges. \\n\\nThe conclusion is that this crisis  serves  not  merely  today,   but   in    fact   now,    as   we  are, of   global   justice  gone   for   too  much. It is a time when we need  greater  focus  on   mult larity, on H – B – J,     on global     power  structures,      on international     justice   as    well     as     regional     security   issues   like  economic   instability   or  natural   disasters.   Moreover, we must remember that these are issues that are far  from  solved  by  either   U . S .  administration   alone, or even   jointly  among  several  leading  developed  economies. They require  collective  action  across   borders  so  we can   truly  address   these   challenges.\\n\\nFinally, president Ram cappeda  calls  us  into  question  whether  our  approach   is   sufficient.  \\n\\nWe need   an   opposite   path:   not   just   saving  Pret orsa   from   being   bullied   by   white   Nation   groups,   \\nbut   also   addressing   other   nations   that   are   at   similar   cross   paths.  \\nThis   means  going  further   into   more   serious   international   poli   cal   action.   \\nInstead of trying   to   protect   ourselves,  \\nwe  need    to    take  responsibility   beyond   our   own  comfort  zone. \\nThis  will  require   countries   all   over     who   have   rotated   presi  cons   within   their   institutions, \\nas well   those   still   under   Trump.    We  must  recognize  how  important  their    roles  can  \\nbe   today.    \\n \\nThe   truth is, both   US   administration and   African  nation   leaders  have  been   trying  \\nto  shape  policies  around   this   problem,  \\n\\nBut   ultimately, neither   has   been  successful.    \\n\\nThis is because  neither has been able to truly   address  mult ipar ity  globally, \\n\\nnor   acknowledge  what  they   face. Both have been trying, say, white Nation  dominance  \\n\\nbut  trying it   wrong. Because  you can’t   get   around  protection ist   sentiments   when   it  \\n\\ncomes   down   so   hard. And  while  Trump is trying his best   (and  he’s   really trying) to  \\n\\npromote  something   different, some of us   on both sides  haven’t  yet  figured   out   how    \\n\\nto   do   better. Hence, when  things get  too   intense, they’re  all  looking for answers  \\n\\nthat are too far  \\n\\nfor   either  side. Instead, what’s needed is for African   nation  leaders to get  \\n\\nmore   focused   than  themselves, getting   what   they need, without   getting  tied  up   with    \\nus. That’s  why  John  Doe  said, “We  shouldn’t be  working   only   here. We should be  \\n\\nworking   both here and there.”  \\n\\nIn  conclusion   of all this, African nation leaders need not merely save  pretors  \\n\\nfrom  bullying  White  Nations  anymore. For  African nations, saving themselves is  \\n\\nfar  harder, because their problems are so deeply  intertwined with global  \\npoli cal  struggles. Thus, if we want to save Pret or any other African  \\nnations, whether it is itself or not, beyond just trying white-Nation  domination, is  \\nfar from being possible. African leaders must work together to create more  \\n\\nserious international policies. Only then can African countries truly  \\naddress the challenges they face, moving beyond the toxic  \\npols and into a path of real and sustainable change. Finally, calling  \\nfor an anti-white-Natio  stance is essential. No one should try  again to  \\npromize  anything  \\n\\nbeyond  some  form of protection, either for themselves or for white Nations. Such  \\napproaches are harmful and counterproductive, ultimately. Therefore, instead of  \\n\\njustifying  your  actions  through  talking  about  saving Pret, you should call  \\n\\ninto  attention  those  who are being bullied by white_Nation groups. Not only  \\nshould you support African leader  efforts  toward their own development,    \\nbut also, any African country that wants to ensure its own survival and  \\nwell-being, should  align  closer with African institutions. Otherwise, those who  \\n\\nare  part  rotating  there  could end up being at a crossroad, just like Pret. If  \\nyou  don’t, your own country can become a symbol of bullying and division. Once  \\nagain, think about what truly matters: African unity, racial justice  \\n\\nwithin African societies, sustainable economic growth, environmental  \\nconservation, national security. Ultimately, only when all these  \\naspects are  \\n\\naddressed can the African world truly move forward. Moving beyond a  \\nsituation where African governments are just protecting themselves from white  \\nNations is necessary. Similarly, preventing the spread of white/Nationism is critical. At the same time, avoiding the use of any form that benefits the white  \\n\\nNation, such as protection of refugees or aid to white nations’  \\nleaders, can help prevent the escalation of tensions into something more  \\nunmanageable. Moreover  should not allow  any  country  (whether or  \\nnot it includes African ones)  even  if  facing  similar  problems, be able  \\n\\neither  directly  support  refugees  via  aid  programs or provide  financial   \\nassistance to White_Nations  leadership  positions. Those who do so can  \\n\\nfinally  be seen as contributing to global instability. Furthermore, countries  \\nwho are part rotating of African G –2 0 should take the lead in creating  \\nmore serious international relations. Including African members of  \\nBR I — S and other regional groups who face similar challenges, creating  \\n\\na more robust and stable international order is crucial. By doing so, Africa can ensure that its institutions and people are working together towards global goals, rather than being in conflict with other regions. Additionally, addressing issues such  high  inequality, poverty, corruption, resource  scarcity, climate change  etc., will help in building a sustainable African economy, improving living standards, fostering social justice within African communities, promoting environmental sustainability, enhancing national  sovereignty, protecting national diversity, safeguarding  cultural heritage, building  resilience  which will be vital for rebuilding  Africa after its current state. Indeed, all of these aspects are critical to achieving African self-determination and ensuring the country’s long term stability. From an international perspective, balancing  between protecting African sovereignty and promoting global development is key. Neither side should dominate the conversation. Rather, through collaboration and mutual respect, each country should contribute to building an interconnected and harmonious world where everyone’s rights are respected and their needs are met. When this is achieved, Africans can feel safe, secure, prosperous, educated, informed, employed, respected, valued, protected, even in their rotating positions in these institutions—where they are in fact at an intersection of multiple global and regional challenges that require collective action to solve. On the other hand, allowing any country, regardless of its political orientation, simply to support refugees through aid programs, provide financial assistance to former White-Nations leaders (like DonaldTrump), or engage in other forms of support that benefit the former white national groups can further escalate tensions between African and white countries, exacerbating the existing issues rather  than resolving them. Consequently, by promoting an approach where neither white nor African groups are dominant, nor are they trying anything that can harm the interests of either, individuals and institutions can work toward creating more equal, fair, efficient, equitable, transparent, accountable, inclusive, responsive, responsible, ethical, collaborative, constructive, respectful, non-discriminatory, open,透明, accountability, proactive, innovative, wise, effective, coordinated, holistic, balanced and multi-faceted international governance systems. Building such systems requires African leadership to prioritize the well-being of their people and to build a foundation of trust and cooperation among themselves and with their international partners. Creating a system where each African state and institution takes a leading role in shaping and implementing policies that address global challenges such that African contributions are recognized, acknowledged, celebrated, validated, credited, documented, measured, assessed, ranked, recognized and ranked appropriately, based on their unique contributions to African development and international cooperation, would be more effective in achieving sustainable development. Failing to recognize the contributions of each state’s and institutional’s efforts to fostering African progress, cooperation in developing African states and systems, sharing knowledge, resources, expertise, knowledge and resources with each Western partner, will lead to even more severe consequences. Each African institution and each member’s role is vital in contributing their strengths and expertise to solving the problems that affect their country. A more proactive approach would require African stakeholders to work with Western partners to better coordinate their efforts on multlipolar and multilevel issues affecting African regions, address challenges like inequality and poverty in Africa through targeted assistance, promote sustainable and equitable economic development in African economies, build institutions for sustainable governance, protect cultural and natural heritage of Africa to preserve its unique identity, ensure the safety and security of people in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, combat climate risks and environmental degradation, improve access to education and healthcare in all African sub-regions, foster economic inclusion and social integration within all regions of Sub-Saharan African, strengthen inter- and intra-regional partnerships and collaborations, leverage the strengths of existing African organizations and national institutions in addressing global issues through better coordination and collaboration, create new opportunities for Africa in its rotating presidence, invest in and support human capital development within Africa (including in universities and businesses), build infrastructure and capacity for economic and political development across Africa as part, enhance African digital infrastructure to improve governance and communication, empower African citizens to engage with and participate in governance through effective governance models, participate more actively in local and inter-local governance processes, integrate African governance into global governance frameworks, support the development of institutions that promote and safeguard human dignity and rights in both African contexts and globally. To ensure African stability and development beyond their current rotating position, institutions such African National Congress, National Assembly, Senate, House, Parliaments, Ombul, Nsangou, among others, must play a central role, playing a pivotal role not in isolation but as partners in solving global problems. Having African political institutions as key participants in ensuring that their institutions are functioning effectively and that they contribute their wisdom, strength, capacity, skills, insights, contributions, perspectives, abilities, achievements, strengths, vulnerabilities, gaps, opportunities, challenges and risks to effectively address multivariate global, inter and trans-regioal issues within the international system, thereby ensuring African\\'s own and others\\' stability through a collective approach. Setting up a multilingual, multi-institutional African policy framework that recognizes the unique strengths that each institution brings to its work, identifies the gaps in knowledge that need addressing, creates a coordinated and actionable plan that bridges these gaps through dialogue and consultation, ensures that policies are responsive to regional, political, cultural, historical, temporal, social and legal dimensions of challenges being addressed, addresses the root causes of inequalities and systemic issues so that no one is left behind, builds a strong foundation for inclusive and progressive African policies, promotes the protection and promotion of human and ethnic rights within each region, fosters the creation of sustainable institutions capable of responding to challenges in an African context, enhances the capacity of Western and African partners and stakeholders in working with Africa towards solving these challenges through coordinated efforts that include African actors in decision-making, policy-making and implementation, work towards building African’s capacity to lead and manage global affairs, take on more responsibility for building and maintaining African national and sectoral institutions to play an active role. Ensuring that Africa is no longer just a spectator but an integral part and a significant actor in systems that aim to resolve global conflicts and issues facing the region. One of those systems is G12, another is BRICs (Brazil, Republic of Congo,India,China), another BR S (BR South, USA, Middle East), etc.—so, multiple systems but all centered on African issues or African-related issues—thus, better understanding and alignment on how African can contribute. Making sure that all global regional and geopolitical issues impacting Africa are addressed through African actions so as to prevent, at least in some cases, situations where Africa was just another region for which global policies were applied, possibly leading elsewhere—so that when it comes to international affairs that could impact Africa but are also global in nature, one must recognize that global approaches are inappropriate for solving African problems—except when they can be applied in conjunction with local knowledge. Global approaches can only be used when there is adequate local understanding, context and capability, otherwise, their use can lead astray. Africa has to become the center of both global efforts and local efforts. Being a country where global international institutions cannot work alone but require an integrative, multifacile, cross-pollinating approach that acknowledges the differences in goals and contexts. Perhaps, being partaking in such a collaboration would help ensure a better approach for dealing with international issues involving African dimensions. Adding African voices and perspectives to these international processes would not lead anywhere but to division, unless the collaboration is mutually beneficial and complementary. Meaning, Western institutions should support Africa\\'s participation in regional multivalent processes that take into account Africa. Like, developing and establishing African representatives in institutions like G-T2 (G2 + Africa), which would allow African participants to have the opportunity to voice their voices, input their ideas, learn from other participants, form new alliances, exchange perspectives and ideas. Maybe, having African delegates in those institutions would make sense, similar to how the UN has African delegations in various international organizations, providing a platform for collaboration. How this could be done is unclear, probably through the establishment of an Africa-G22 or similar initiative, involving collaboration between Africa institutions (e.g., NPS, ACF, AFDA, ANP, NAIF) and UN institutions or other international bodies. Possibly, working in tandem with UN agencies, setting up an inter-African and International African Mechanisms, programs and platforms for dialogue, collaboration on common issues faced by African peoples and by other developing countries. Plus, initiatives like African Digitalization, supporting the preservation of cultural assets, digitalization of education, healthcare, infrastructure, employment, transport, communication. Efforts to promote African economic self-governance, development financing, financial inclusion, access, participation, role and representation. Some countries in Sub-South Africa already have initiatives, albeit not as comprehensive as needed, towards these. Countries like South Sudan, Zaire, Uganda, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,ungure, Kigman, Tzintjao, Burundi, Democratic Republic, Congo (Rwanda), Kenya. There\\'s already a network of organizations like NPA (Napoleonic African Alliance), African Union, UN Africa etc, plus regional organizations. Yes, many African regional institutions already operate. Their role should include participating in, collaborating with, learning from, integrating into, contributing, receiving support from and interacting with United Nations bodies, organizations within and outside the United States, within G-Belt, B-R-B, Etc. initiatives. G-RB, yes. BR-B is part. RBR is an acronym for regional blocs. Probably, adding African participation to such regional initiatives can create synergies. An example would include the formation of regional African Organizations, representing African member states, co-opting their representatives into African-Globally coordinated institutions where they have expertise and can form part or lead the initiatives that tackle global African challenges—this could help create stronger institutions within BR, R-B etc.\\n\\nFurthermore, establishing a regional network for inter-sub regional cooperation. Regions like Sub-AR, Sub-Afri, sub-AM, SADC, SAEC, SOA, SRB. Through these, participants can collaborate on issues relevant to their sub-region, share experiences, coordinate efforts in policy making, decision making and advocacy, identify gaps and opportunities in coordination, facilitate dialogue. Bringing together countries and regions in each of G, RB,BR,etc. can promote inter-regios coordination on addressing African global needs. Another approach is regional partnerships, hosting African bodies in UN or GLO institutions so they receive support and have opportunities to participate. Establishing African agencies within UN and World Bank, recognizing their contributions and use their resources effectively. Importing and adopting African-specific policies and practices into international frameworks. Implementing international aid and assistance programs that align and complement African needs, contribute knowledge of local development to broader development goals. Developing African youth and young people to think critically, engage positively, advocate for and protect their rights, develop skills in advocacy and leadership, serve as role models for equality, diversity and inclusion. Addressing the issues on which African has the potential to act as its representative, highlighting its strengths as being able and willing to contribute, aligning with its historical and current strengths. Thinking of how to leverage African expertise in areas such human resource development (education, health, workforce development), gender equality and empowerment, anti-corruption, equality of opportunity, youth empowerment. Engaging in campaigns that raise awareness and mobilize support for these areas. Enhancing African cultural institutions\\' capacity and relevance in public discourse and governance. Strengthening partnerships with human development organizations to share knowledge on development challenges with AFG, F/GF, others. Promoting African education systems to foster inclusive education that reflects African values, inclusivity, equity, justice and diversity. Expanding African training programs in development assistance and financial institutions: training institutions on topics like poverty alleviation, small and microeconomic development.\\n\\nLastly, thinking about how these changes can address African specific issues: poverty and inequality within Sub Sahara, inequality in education within sub Saharans, wealth inequality across African borders, gender inequality. Specifically, targeting the following areas: human right protection in regions (in particular, regions where human resources are most in deficit), poverty reduction in underdeveloped and poorer African developing nations (both in developed and developing contexts), wealth and resource inequality (as measured by national Gini coefficients, intra regional), inequality of opportunities (measured by poverty lines and access levels), economic inequality between developed African developed nations and those with lower development levels. Understanding that inequality is created by a combination of factors, primarily and most strongly, includes structural inequality—inequality in resource allocation, distribution of political power and influence, lack of public support, protection against and against all forms, mechanisms, structures of inequality.\\n\\nBy addressing these specific areas, focusing primarily on human protection (to protect human life and property, prevent harm to others), against inequality that affects human well being, poor education levels, unequal resources and wealth, unfair opportunities.\\n\\nUltimately, adopting a multi-party approach to political and policy issues can achieve more than one-sided responses, taking into consideration the specific needs of countries facing these problems and working toward a solution that’s fair and balanced.\\n\\nHaving established a framework for this approach in multiple African areas and extending it to other parts of international policy, enabling African Governments to move beyond toxic diplomatic polices and work more constructively toward building sustainable international orders.\\n\\nAlright.

Since DonaldTrump returned from his tour, we've seen a shift that many consider a 'bad trend,' and this continues to grow. I want Preta to bear the brunt of responsibility because the people of Pretabwe are being misled by a political movement that seeks to protect them from what's happening in your country. This movement, led by some in white nationalism against our nation, has caused immense harm to Pretaba, not just through bullying, though there are certainly consequences to their lives. We must navigate a future where Pretaby is not simply bullied but is instead being subjected to harsher realities and challenges.\"\n",

Highlight that human right issues are at stake, particularly in areas like human capital and education. Conclude with how these growing tensions are not only between South非洲 and Pretap but also between rising political powers and SouthAfri. Emphasize that these are global issues that require immediate attention, something Ramappa is urging us to take.\n",
